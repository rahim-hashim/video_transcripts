# Canada delivers FATAL BLOW to Trumpâ€¦INSPIRES WORLD!
**MeidasTouch:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM)
*  Elbows up, Canada. Elbows up, maple mitis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada on the front lines of preserving and protecting democracy internationally. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=3.96s)]
*  Canada showing the entire world the roadmap for how you stand up to an authoritarian like Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=10.84s)]
*  Canada showing not just how you play defense against an authoritarian like Donald Trump, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  but how you go on the offense, how you inflict real pain on Donald Trump and his regime [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=25.56s)]
*  for even proposing the idea of Canada becoming a 51st state. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=33.36s)]
*  Donald Trump's rhetoric about annexation and taking over Canada and calling the Prime Minister a governor [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=39.08s)]
*  backfired in Donald Trump and his regime's face. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=46.96s)]
*  The boycott in Canada going strong, boycotting American products, boycotting American tourism. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=51.16s)]
*  And as I said, Canada provided the roadmap to the world in Europe, in Australia, and elsewhere. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=58.48s)]
*  They're seeing how Canada did it. They are copying it as well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=65.56s)]
*  And Canada also showing what it means to be a leader in the age of Trump authoritarianism [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=70.08s)]
*  and how a leader needs to stand up to Donald Trump and not kiss the gangster ring. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=77.88s)]
*  Folks, election is right around the corner in Canada. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=83.8s)]
*  Monday, April 28th, there's already been a record setting turnout in the advance polls. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=88.28s)]
*  And also when we look at the underlying polling data, there's been a complete reversal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=96.6s)]
*  of who is expected to win this race from where the race was two or three months ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=103.48s)]
*  Previously, Pierre Poliev and the Conservative Party was expected to get a majority and win in the election. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=109.2s)]
*  Now it's completely flipped as the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poliev has demonstrated that, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  well, Poliev at least has demonstrated that he is Maple Maga, that he has been an agent of Trump, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=125.64s)]
*  that he's worked with people like Daniel Smith, the premier of Alberta, to try to have Trump interfere [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=132.4s)]
*  and tamper with the Canadian elections as Pierre Poliev has used that rhetoric of woke this, woke that, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=139.52s)]
*  woke mind virus as he's invited Elon Musk and right-wing podcasters to try to amplify their dangerous ideas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=147.32s)]
*  as he's basically proposed Poliev has a version of Doge in Canada to gut the health care system [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=157.6s)]
*  and all of the social services there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=166.0s)]
*  I think people in Canada woke up and said, whoa, whoa, whoa, we see what's going on in the United States [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=168.2s)]
*  and we don't want Doge Canada, Musk in Canada, Trump in Canada. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  And we've seen Prime Minister Mark Carney after getting the baton passed by former Prime Minister Trudeau, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=181.32s)]
*  taking that baton and showing what it means to be a real business person, a banker versus the bankruptor in Donald Trump, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=189.12s)]
*  a builder in Carney, someone who has helped Canada and the United Kingdom through difficult periods [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=198.4s)]
*  as a governor of their major banks to Donald Trump, someone who has bankrupted company after company. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=205.72s)]
*  And we're seeing Donald Trump bankrupt the United States right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  But folks, let me be very clear. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=215.76s)]
*  Polls don't vote. People vote. In this case, Canadians vote. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=218.2s)]
*  You can't take anything for granted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=222.72s)]
*  And no matter what, wherever you are in the world, you need to vote to support democracy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=225.12s)]
*  I'll just leave it at that to protect and defend and to support democracy and to stand up against Trumpism everywhere. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=230.4s)]
*  But you know what? I really got to give a hat tip to one person in particular who I think is a real hero here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=241.12s)]
*  Charlie Angus, a former member of Parliament in Canada. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=249.76s)]
*  He served with distinction for 21 years and he was always Charlie Angus. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=255.4s)]
*  People would always speak so highly of him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=263.92s)]
*  And in his last year, over the last several months, he got to show the world what he has fought for his entire career. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=266.8s)]
*  And folks, it has been the honor of my lifetime to become friends with Charlie Angus, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=275.8s)]
*  to get to be a member of your community, the maple mitis. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=283.06s)]
*  It has been the honor of a lifetime to fight for democracy with you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=288.66s)]
*  And I know I'm right here in the territory of Donald Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  We're fighting from within here, but we stand in solidarity with democracy and everybody in Canada who's on the front lines preserving and protecting it, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=298.52s)]
*  not just in Canada, but across the world and showing the world the roadmap for how you stand up against the Trump regime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=308.92s)]
*  So in giving my hat tip to Charlie Angus, who's retired, he's no longer a member of Parliament on his own terms. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  He's left, but he's got an incredible career ahead of him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  And trust me, I'm working behind the scenes to have him lead the maple mitis network that I want to further build out in Canada. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  So y'all can tell him and pitch him, Charlie, you got to do that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=337.44s)]
*  But in honor of Charlie and all of the work that he's done, let's go back a little bit on memory lane. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=341.5s)]
*  I want to show you some of the highlights that I've had with Charlie Angus here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=347.44s)]
*  So I first saw Charlie Angus give that incredible speech in the House of Commons when nobody was speaking up against Donald Trump, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=352.2s)]
*  when everyone was scared and nervous and rightfully so. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=361.3s)]
*  I get it. Angus stood up and he gave the first emphatic international public speech calling out Donald Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=365.24s)]
*  I watched that here and I was like, who is this guy? That was incredible. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=374.0s)]
*  I reached out to him. He responded. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=379.1s)]
*  And here is one of the first interviews I did with Charlie Angus where he talks about you'll see the evolution here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=381.6s)]
*  You're going to love this. So here, Charlie Angus starts talking about, look, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=389.5s)]
*  he goes, in Canada, we have a tradition of not wanting to be openly confrontive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=393.84s)]
*  That's just not who we are. But Donald Trump is a different kind of animal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  So this was from several months ago. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=404.88s)]
*  And you'll see over the weeks and months till the present how things evolved in Canada. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=408.34s)]
*  And I'll show it to you through the lens of Charlie Angus here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  Watch this clip right here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=417.34s)]
*  We are not we're we're not going to be slapped around like this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=418.64s)]
*  I think there's a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  I think that's who we are. But Donald Trump's a different kind of animal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=428.44s)]
*  He's playing for the rage algorithms. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=432.18s)]
*  And I don't think we should allow him that free rein. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=435.04s)]
*  So for me, it was really simple standing up and say, no, we're going to have tough negotiations. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=439.18s)]
*  Fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=445.24s)]
*  I mean, he's a juvenile and I invite Donald Trump. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  Come up any time in the winter, Donald, try and drive our roads, try and win an argument with any woman in Canada, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=452.68s)]
*  try and take us on on anything where we are very comfortable at. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  We're pretty tough and resilient people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=463.88s)]
*  All right. So a few weeks after that, I had Charlie Angus back on the program. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=465.62s)]
*  And he said, you know what? Something's happening, Ben. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  Something's happening. The message I'm hearing across Canada is they're not afraid of Trump. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=473.08s)]
*  Something was happening, something that looked different. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  Charlie was on me. Watch this clip. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=482.68s)]
*  Mr. Angus, what's the latest? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=484.97999999999996s)]
*  What do you want to say to Donald Trump? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=487.32s)]
*  Well, listen, Mr. Trump, right now you're trying to shut down the American economy for Christmas. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=490.18s)]
*  I mean, who does that and what? Because Elon told you to do that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=496.78s)]
*  Like you are plunging your nation and your people into a world of hurt. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=501.28s)]
*  And so what are you doing? You decided you're going to pick on your quiet next door neighbor. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=505.58s)]
*  That's like going to the librarian down the street and shouting at them to divert attention because the cops are after you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=509.82s)]
*  No, we're not going to put up with it, Donald. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. We've got the world's longest undefended border. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=518.62s)]
*  We've got one hundred billion dollars worth of trade. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=523.42s)]
*  We've got just in time delivery going back and forth all across the border. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=525.54s)]
*  And you want to put not just Canada, but your own citizens in a world of hurt. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=529.54s)]
*  What? To look like you're tougher than us? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, go for it. It's going to hurt. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=537.74s)]
*  It's going to hurt a lot of people on both sides. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=540.54s)]
*  But the message that I'm hearing from people across Canada is they're not afraid of you because they know you're a convicted felon. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  They know that all the people that you bring in to run your organization right now, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  and I call it an organization rather than a government, are all grifters and thieves and thugs. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=557.04s)]
*  We got to look after our own interests right now. We will work with your country. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=563.3399999999999s)]
*  We will work with our great neighbors. But Donald, don't push us around. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=566.64s)]
*  And Charlie Angus talked about in this next interview I did a few weeks later, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=570.3399999999999s)]
*  he talked about how when he would watch the U.S. media and CNN talk about, oh, Donald Trump's just teasing this, teasing that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  Watch what he says here. Play this clip. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=583.54s)]
*  Watching some of the response in the U.S. media, CNN stated, oh, he's just teasing, teasing about taking over other countries. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=585.44s)]
*  But then they said that, you know, hey, it'd be a great deal for America to be bigger than Louisiana Purchase. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=594.74s)]
*  There's no such thing as teasing when you're threatening the sovereignty of independent nations. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=598.94s)]
*  And I think for a lot of us, we just thought Donald sort of acted like the buffoon, but he wasn't that stupid. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=604.44s)]
*  But here's a man who, when Putin launched his murderous war in Ukraine, praised Putin, said he was savvy, said he was a genius. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=611.84s)]
*  And he has one of his Putin trolls taking up one of the key places in his new administration. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  So his disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty sent, I think, a very, very chilly message. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=624.94s)]
*  His attacks on Panama, his attacks on Greenland, his attacks on Canada are sending a message that he doesn't respect the international order in terms of the rights of nations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=630.5400000000001s)]
*  And we have to start taking that, I think, a lot more seriously. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=641.74s)]
*  And then, folks, the gloves started coming off even more, started going over the boards, elbows up, started coming into the... [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=644.94s)]
*  Well, it's always been in the parlance there. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=656.34s)]
*  But in the context of elbows up against Donald Trump, here's what Charlie Angus then told me a few weeks after that, playing this clip. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=658.34s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, you're a disgrace as a human being. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=666.14s)]
*  I'm sorry, you may have gotten the presidency, but you're a disgrace. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=669.14s)]
*  You're a convicted felon. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=672.24s)]
*  You're a pervert. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  You treat your allies with absolute disdain while you kiss up to Putin. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=681.64s)]
*  We are your best neighbor. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=682.64s)]
*  We are your best ally. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=684.14s)]
*  We are your number one trading partner. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  But we won't break, Donald, because you think your grifter politics can push us around. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=687.24s)]
*  And we will continue to defend the international world order. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=693.04s)]
*  We will continue to work with NATO. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=696.24s)]
*  We will continue to work with Ukraine. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=697.94s)]
*  So, Donald, I know this is a big diversion exercise for you to change the channels in the United States, but you're going to have to explain to the American people very quickly why you brought in so many grifters and crooks with you. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=700.1400000000001s)]
*  The American people aren't going to put up with it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=716.24s)]
*  And the Canadian people, we will never put up with it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=717.94s)]
*  Anytime, Donald, anywhere, we will take you on. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=721.44s)]
*  Did you know that the liver is the second largest organ in your body? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=724.64s)]
*  It's responsible for over 500 functions in your body. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  But for some reason, liver health doesn't always get the attention that it deserves. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=731.04s)]
*  Dose for your liver was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  Why does this matter? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=742.04s)]
*  Well, your liver is the second largest organ in your body and is responsible for over 500 functions in your body. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  It acts as your body's filter, flushing out unwanted elements and breaking down what you consume into essential nutrients. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=750.24s)]
*  The liver produces and regulates cholesterol, stores vitamins and minerals, and impacts digestive and metabolic health, amongst many other things. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=756.94s)]
*  Dose's science-backed formula promotes liver function, aids digestion, eases bloating, and even boosts energy levels. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=765.14s)]
*  Clinical results. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=771.84s)]
*  In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, dose for your liver lowered liver enzyme levels by 50% in over 86% of participants. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=772.84s)]
*  Stick with dose and feel the incredible benefits. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=782.64s)]
*  Over time, with more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction of brain fog, and better sleep, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=785.44s)]
*  one dose for your liver shot is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=793.44s)]
*  Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and vegan. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=798.74s)]

*  I had another interview with Charlie Angus where he then said, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=820.14s)]
*  Here's how it's going to go down, Donald. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's how Canada is going to stand up to you. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=826.34s)]
*  We're going to boycott you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=828.84s)]
*  This clip right here is the early stages of Canada's boycott against the U.S. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=830.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=836.44s)]
*  I was in a coffee shop today. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=837.24s)]
*  People were coming up to me and I said, hey, simple thing, you know, you can do your part. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=838.74s)]
*  Don't buy American. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=842.84s)]
*  And they said, what are you talking about? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  We stopped buying products in the grocery stores over a week ago. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  We check everything we buy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=848.44s)]
*  So here's how it's going to go down. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=850.44s)]
*  This is going to be very rough. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=852.54s)]
*  But the big wake up call is for our American friends. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=854.74s)]
*  For example, Kentucky, the number one purchaser of Kentucky spirits in the world is Canada. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=859.24s)]
*  And all our provinces have just pulled it off the shelves. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=867.54s)]
*  So there that's that's the first hit that we we push back the auto sector communities like [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=870.54s)]
*  Bowling Green, Arlington, Lansing, Toledo. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=876.34s)]
*  Your plants are going to go down in a week. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=881.84s)]
*  I'm not bragging. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=884.24s)]
*  I'm not boasting. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=885.14s)]
*  I'm not threatening. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=885.94s)]
*  But the auto sector is so integrated in North America that if Donald Trump starts throwing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  up barriers for just-in-time delivery of important parts to American auto plants, the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=892.94s)]
*  assembly lines start to come down very quickly. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=899.34s)]
*  Then when Donald Trump first threatened the tariffs against Canada and then Donald Trump [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=903.14s)]
*  pulled back those tariffs, watch what Angus said. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=908.54s)]
*  He goes, you choke, Donald. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=911.34s)]
*  You choke playing this clip. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=913.04s)]
*  Well, I'm wearing my Team Canada jersey tonight because we have this tradition in Canada [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=915.14s)]
*  for American viewers who don't watch hockey. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=920.9399999999999s)]
*  It's called going over the boards. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=923.24s)]
*  And we learned this as kids. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, when one of yours is threatened, the coach says go over the boards boys and [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=926.74s)]
*  we go over and we take the other team and we get game misconducts and we get slashing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=931.94s)]
*  penalties. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=938.34s)]
*  But it's like they never touch one of our players again. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  And right now Canada's feeling we were just set to go over the boards and Donald Trump [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  choked. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=948.24s)]
*  So we're really glad that we're not going into a trade war. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=949.84s)]
*  But we're also feeling this was a moment to take this guy on. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=952.74s)]
*  He blinked. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=956.74s)]
*  He choked. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=958.24s)]
*  What? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=959.74s)]
*  He was two days ago. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=960.1400000000001s)]
*  He was telling us that if we didn't give up our nationhood, the tariffs were going to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=961.74s)]
*  stay on and then we hit them with $125 billion worth of tariffs and we started taking off [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=966.54s)]
*  the Kentucky booze off our shelves. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=970.64s)]
*  Then we started to take off the California wines. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=972.94s)]
*  Then we said you're going to get another $25 billion right after that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=975.54s)]
*  And the market started to tank and he suddenly said, oh, didn't you guys have a plan that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=980.14s)]
*  was already to deal with the border like back in December? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=985.14s)]
*  I love that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=988.34s)]
*  I'll take that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=989.04s)]
*  This is Mr. Art of the deal. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=989.94s)]
*  Well, from a Canadian perspective, Donald, you seriously pissed us off. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=992.24s)]
*  You insulted us. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=997.6400000000001s)]
*  You degraded our nation. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=998.84s)]
*  And we stepped up and I got a lot of people calling me and saying I don't want to back [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1000.6400000000001s)]
*  down now. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't trust this guy. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1007.6400000000001s)]
*  I've lost trust in our American allies. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1009.34s)]
*  So yeah, we will take whatever your 30-day grace period while you go back and deal with [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1011.84s)]
*  your other fights. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1019.34s)]
*  But right now, Canada is still sorely pissed. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1020.14s)]
*  And I think we're going to have to deal with this in the long term. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1023.34s)]
*  And over time, Charlie Angus started talking about how the boycott was impacting Americans [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1026.24s)]
*  and that he and Canadians knew that they were now out maneuvering Donald Trump that Canadians [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1031.44s)]
*  were taking the initiative here play this clip. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1038.54s)]
*  Well, we talked on a previous show about what will happen in Ottawa within four days Toledo [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1041.04s)]
*  and Lansing. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  Bowling Green will start going down. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1046.54s)]
*  And the day after the tariffs were announced, he immediately backed down on auto. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1048.84s)]
*  Why wasn't he taking advice from the big automakers in the first place of the chaos that he would [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1053.34s)]
*  cause? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1059.1399999999999s)]
*  Now in agriculture, it's going to be another big area with $73 billion shared trade. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  This is a totally integrated market. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1064.84s)]
*  And Donald promised lower grocery prices in his first hundred days. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  Americans like Canadians have already seen the shocks of inflation, the shocks of post-COVID. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1071.4399999999998s)]
*  Once he starts messing with that market and he's saying some things in Kuzma are protected [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1077.14s)]
*  and other things aren't, nobody knows. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1082.74s)]
*  It's creating uncertainty and it's making it very difficult for suppliers on both sides [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1084.74s)]
*  of the border. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1089.24s)]
*  So I think what American farmers are waking up to is the fact that Canadians are no longer [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1090.14s)]
*  buying their products. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1094.24s)]
*  We just we're just not going to participate in this abusive relationship. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1095.54s)]
*  You threaten us. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1098.94s)]
*  We don't buy your products. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1099.74s)]
*  How about that? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1100.94s)]
*  Here, Charlie Angus talks to me about what deeper issue was going on that Canadians are [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1102.34s)]
*  like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1107.34s)]
*  We see America falling into totalitarianism. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1109.64s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1112.34s)]
*  But I think there's something deeper, Ben, that Canadians are really focusing on right [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1113.84s)]
*  now, which is watching our nearest neighbors slip into totalitarianism. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1119.74s)]
*  When we see people being pulled off the streets, when we see people at universities being [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1125.54s)]
*  grabbed, detained, rendered and kidnapped, and then we see Kristi Noem, you know, the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1131.04s)]
*  Homeland Security boss doing this really disgusting video in front of half naked men in an [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  overcrowded El Salvadorian prison cell. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1145.74s)]
*  We're looking at a nation that we don't understand anymore and we don't want to be like [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1147.74s)]
*  that nation. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1152.94s)]
*  And we are thinking if we go down the road with this regime, we're talking about the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1154.1399999999999s)]
*  disappearance of the rule of law. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1160.54s)]
*  And that's deeply offensive to us. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1163.34s)]
*  It's deeply offensive to our friends in Europe. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1165.34s)]
*  It's deeply offensive to our friends in Australia and Japan and elsewhere. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1167.44s)]
*  So we're now, as the Prime Minister said, we're having to look elsewhere for the kind [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1172.24s)]
*  of alliances and agreements and understandings that we used to have with our nearest neighbor. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1178.04s)]
*  If our nearest neighbor doesn't respect the rule of law for its citizens, how's it going [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1185.24s)]
*  to respect the rule of international law? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1190.44s)]
*  And it certainly doesn't respect us as Canada. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1193.14s)]
*  So we have no choice. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1195.3400000000001s)]
*  We have to make decisions and we're going to make decisions that benefit our region [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1197.44s)]
*  and our people first. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1201.24s)]
*  And then most recently when I had Charlie Angus on, he said, thank you, Donald. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1202.44s)]
*  It's the only time I'm going to say this. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1208.74s)]
*  He goes, you united Canada better than anybody. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1211.28s)]
*  You taught us why we need to be together to stand up against bullies like you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1215.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1221.68s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, I'm going to say this once and I might never say it again. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1222.68s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1225.68s)]
*  I want to thank you for bringing Canada together. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1227.18s)]
*  It took such a malignant narcissistic slug like you to make us put aside all of our differences, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1230.18s)]
*  all our regional fights, all of our concerns with each other and realize that we actually [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1237.68s)]
*  had to stand up for something better, which is standing up for the rule of law, standing [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1242.28s)]
*  up for democracy, standing up for decency. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1246.08s)]
*  And we know that we're on your border and it freaks you out because you and your in [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1249.48s)]
*  cell gang are so freaked out about diversity, equity, inclusion, your DEI nightmare. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1253.28s)]
*  Well, we are your DEI nightmare, Donald, because Canada is always going to be a country of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1260.28s)]
*  diversity. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1265.78s)]
*  We will always be a country of equity. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1266.78s)]
*  We will always be a country of inclusion and we will defend the rule of law. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1269.68s)]
*  And if you want to continue fighting with us, you are going to lose at the end of the day. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1273.68s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt us, but we are true. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1277.68s)]
*  We are North. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1280.68s)]
*  We are strong. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1281.68s)]
*  We are free and we are ready for this fight, Donald. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1282.68s)]
*  So make up your mind. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1284.68s)]
*  Quit your fighting on social media with us. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1286.18s)]
*  Tell us what you're going to do because we're moving on and we're going to stand and hold [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1289.18s)]
*  the line. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1293.18s)]
*  Pitch perfect. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1294.18s)]
*  There's so many other clips I could show you. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1295.68s)]

*  other interviews I've done with him. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1303.68s)]
*  It'll be a fun hour and a half, two hours of your time. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1305.18s)]
*  I really mean it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1309.18s)]
*  If you go just search Midas Touch Charlie Angus, watch the series of interviews I've [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1310.18s)]
*  done with him. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1314.68s)]
*  But I thought that now that Charlie's retired, no longer a member of parliament, as we head [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1315.68s)]
*  into Monday's election, I don't know what the results are going to be. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r58zTfssSM&t=1320.68s)]
