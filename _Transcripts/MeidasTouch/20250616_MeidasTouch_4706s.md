Video Description: On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: Trump’s pathetic dictator birthday parade was a total embarrassment — barely anyone showed up — while millions of Americans filled the streets nationwide for the historic No Kings Protests. We break down how Trump’s weak display was overshadowed by a true grassroots uprising. Meanwhile, tensions escalate between Israel and Iran, raising the risk of American military involvement and exposing deep fractures within the MAGA movement. Trump’s performance on the world stage continues to crumble as he arrives at the G7 and bizarrely praises Putin, once again acting like a Kremlin puppet. And in Minnesota, a far-right, Trump-supporting extremist has been arrested for the targeted political murder of a Democratic state lawmaker — while MAGA leaders desperately spread disinformation to cover it up. All that and more from Ben, Brett and Jordy on this packed episode.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 6/16/25
**MeidasTouch:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k)
*  This is the Midas Touch podcast, Brett Jordan, Midas Mighty. Wow, wow, wow. Where do we start? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=0.0s)]
*  The G7 is off to a disastrous start as Donald Trump began by saying that he would have liked [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=8.24s)]
*  Putin to be there. He would want the G7 to be the G8. Later Donald Trump held a press conference [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=15.6s)]
*  with the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, and said that that was the representative [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=21.84s)]
*  from the European Union. Trump then dropped what he purported to be was a trade deal, which I thought [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=27.36s)]
*  they entered three weeks ago, all over the floor. And then earlier in the day in the press conference [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=32.64s)]
*  with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Cardy, Cardy had to invoke his status as chair of the G7 to shut [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=38.24s)]
*  down the press conference because Trump was embarrassing the G7 and the United States so much. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=46.32s)]
*  So we have that we can start with. We can talk about Donald Trump's disastrous dictator parade [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=52.32s)]
*  in Washington DC, which was not that many people attended. It was low energy. What a bizarre event [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=57.6s)]
*  to witness. Trump looked inconsolable, almost like he was going to cry. Melania looked, I've never seen [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=65.84s)]
*  her happier watching Donald Trump suffer like that on stage. So you had the split screen of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=72.4s)]
*  disaster dictator parade, which was so bad. But then you had the best of America with the no kings [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=79.28s)]
*  protests across the country. Some estimates say that more than 10 million Americans were protesting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=86.16s)]
*  the Trump regime, close to that 3% of the entire U.S. population mark, a very important indicator [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  for mass mobilization against regimes. I was at the Pasadena one, Brett was at one, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=100.8s)]
*  Jordi was there, the whole team was out and about. We'll talk about what went down at the no kings [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  protests. We also have a war between Israel and Iran, which started at the end of last week. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has made a lot of posts seeming to indicate that American troops are going to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=121.12s)]
*  officially get involved. He took credit for the initial preemptive strikes by Israel against Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=127.28s)]
*  That's alienated a lot of the MAGA base, which I guess they thought that Donald Trump was going [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=134.96s)]
*  to pull America out of wars, but it was actually former President Biden who pulled America out of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=140.88s)]
*  wars, not Donald Trump. And Trump looking like neocon Trump and seems to be really focused on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=146.16s)]
*  potentially getting America into that war in the Middle East. And then we had that horrific, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=153.28s)]
*  horrific event that happened this weekend, the murder of Minnesota state representative and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=159.28s)]
*  speaker Hortman, killed by an individual named Vance Bolter, a right wing Trump supporting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=164.96s)]
*  extremist. He also attempted to assassinate a Democratic senator, Senator Hoffman. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=172.88s)]
*  Fortunately Hoffman and his wife survived, although state representative Hortman and her husband were [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=178.96s)]
*  killed by Vance Bolter. And then we saw once again that there's no depths to the depravity of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=186.72s)]
*  the right wing disinformation kind of MAGA crew, whether it was Elon Musk or MAGA senators, they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=192.0s)]
*  were spreading lies that the killer was a Democrat, a leftist who just happened to have a list of like [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=200.48s)]
*  70 Democrats that he was looking to go and kill. And so again, you saw all of those lies spreading [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=207.36s)]
*  right away. And then it took some time before we heard from this guy's, the killer's roommate, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=213.36s)]
*  apparently, you know, that the guy was a Trump supporter. And then the facts came out. Let's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  bring in Brett and Jordi. I think this weekend was also though an important time for independent [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  media. You know, we've built this media company in order to be able to amplify the things and fact [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=229.36s)]
*  check the things and do the job that we knew the media was not doing. And so just over the past 48 [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=236.8s)]
*  hours, the Midas Touch Network focused on our protest coverage, has gotten over 32 million views [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=244.4s)]
*  on YouTube alone. Our coverage of, you know, the speeches and the Philadelphia no kings protest [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=251.84s)]
*  got over 1.2 million views. Our coverage of Donald Trump's disastrous dictator parade that got over [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=260.24s)]
*  4 million views alone on that. And so it's been important that we expose everything that's going [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  on. And that's thanks to all of you, the Midas Mighty. Yeah, 100%. Thank you so much, everybody. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  And you know what it tells me? It tells me that there is a thirst out there for pro democracy and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=280.88s)]
*  for pro democracy content. And it's always kind of been our thesis in building this network that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=286.4s)]
*  the things that the corporate media likes to focus on are often the wrong things. And the messaging [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  that they try to push forward, the narratives that they try to conjure up are often not the things [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=296.0s)]
*  that people want to hear about. And they do not reflect the reality of what is actually happening [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=302.4s)]
*  on the ground. So to be able to bring you the no kings protest with our exclusive streams this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  weekend, to make sure that we were covering that heavily and to be doing all of our other coverage [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  and to be getting like record viewership, you know, 33 million views every 48 hours. I think [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=315.04s)]
*  that speaks to, you know, the energy that's out there in this pro democracy community. Like Ben [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  said, you know, we were out there at those no kings rallies this weekend, I was at the one by me and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=325.68s)]
*  the energy was just absolutely incredible. Like, honestly, it felt like almost like a block party [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  of people celebrating democracy, you know, yes, of course, protesting Trump protesting ICE, you know, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=335.44s)]
*  calling for the release of, you know, people who are unlawfully detained by ICE and all of that, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=340.8s)]
*  but also like a big party, a lot of solidarity with that group, people pushing out giving out [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=346.16s)]
*  pizza to each other, making sure that everybody is fed, people handing out waters, making sure [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=352.72s)]
*  that nobody was thirsty was hot, hot, hot, hot by me. But everybody was out there, you know, just [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  out there to support democracy, some great signs, great energy just showing people that we will not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=362.88s)]
*  have a king in this country that we will not bow down to tyrants in this country. So thank you to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=367.92s)]
*  everybody who participated. And if you didn't participate, don't worry. Thank you to everybody [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=372.16s)]
*  for sharing the content about this and getting the word out that is, you know, just as important. So [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=375.92s)]
*  a lot to talk about this episode. I know I have a lot of thoughts on everything else that's been [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=381.92s)]
*  going on in the world, you know, not all of it. Great, of course. And so I'll toss it over to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Jordi, and we'll get into it. Jordi, what's the latest? I'm excited to get going, brothers. I [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=390.24s)]
*  echo your sentiment. Shout out to everybody on the ground this weekend. Way to go. I mean, look, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=394.72s)]
*  the juxtaposition between the no kings marches versus Donald Trump's military style parade [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=399.92s)]
*  cannot be more clear. And Ben, I love that you're talking about the numbers, but what you hit on is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=406.16s)]
*  so key. It goes beyond the numbers of the viewership of what we're doing here at the network. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=412.0s)]
*  There is a true thirst, a true hunger for pro-democracy news. And for us to simply just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=417.04s)]
*  be the vehicle in order to get that out to the folks. I mean, that is so meaningful to me [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=422.88s)]
*  personally. We always view this as an ego-less movement. What's so cool is you guys, the listeners [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=428.4s)]
*  and the viewers, taking what you see here, taking the receipts, bringing it to your families, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  bringing it to the streets, right? There are no kings in the United States of America. This isn't [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=439.44s)]
*  Russia. This isn't China. This isn't how we act here in America. So shout out to y'all, man. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=444.96s)]
*  Hidden in the ground, all the organizers, all the protesters. By the way, Jordan, shush. I was about to add, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=452.72s)]
*  organizers, man, they did a great job. Indivisible 5051. Incredible. All these groups out there, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  just absolutely incredible, incredible work. So thank you for your work because that is far and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=462.48s)]
*  beyond. Just thank you so much. So excited to get into today's show. Benji, where do you want to lead [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  us off? Great point. The real heroes are the grassroots organizers. They've been planning [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=472.24s)]
*  events like this now since the beginning of the Trump regime. When I was speaking to Ezra Levin, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=478.8s)]
*  the head of Indivisible, what he had said though was that in mass mobilization movements, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  it is very important to have media allies. And one of the things that we were observing right [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=491.44s)]
*  after the November election, when all of this corporate news was going to Mar-a-Lago and kissing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=497.52s)]
*  the gangster ring, it was clear to us the writing was on the wall, that they were going to suppress [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=504.0s)]
*  what was really happening. And that was one of the prongs of Donald Trump's authoritarian takeover. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=510.32s)]
*  So we went into overdrive here to build and build and build. And right now, this week, we are so [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=516.96s)]
*  close to hitting 5 million subscribers on the Midas Touch Network already. And I think we'll be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=524.08s)]
*  able to hit that in the next day or two. So make sure you subscribe and share this channel with [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=530.24s)]
*  everybody you know. I want to start, Jordy, though, with California Governor Gavin Newsom's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=535.36s)]
*  supercut that he created contrasting the peaceful protests in California and across the United States [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=541.36s)]
*  to Donald Trump's disastrous dictator event that he held for himself. And Governor Newsom and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=549.6s)]
*  Governor Newsom's social media team, they've been great with rapid response and going on the offense. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=557.68s)]
*  And they haven't been afraid to call Donald Trump out as being cognitively addled as well. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  Let's take a look at the supercut. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=570.0s)]
*  And for those listening on audio, what was going on in the video is you saw the massive crowds for the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=571.52s)]
*  No Kings protests at the various cities, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands at certain cities. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  Then you saw the low energy, almost no attendance at Donald Trump's dictator parade, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=600.8s)]
*  while Donald Trump looked like he was about to cry. He looked inconsolable. Melania looked thrilled [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=606.24s)]
*  to see Donald Trump suffering. And that supercut captured that moment. The squeaky wheels, though. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=612.4s)]
*  Oh, my God. Like that wasn't a sound that was added after the fact. That's how it sounded. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm thinking back to last week, you know, we were speaking about I don't want to diminish [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  the seriousness of Donald Trump trying to even throw himself a dictator parade and trying to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  elevate himself into that role and to try to show that sort of force. But the fact that it looks so [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  stupid, you know, thinking back on it, you know, it's just like it was like the team who parade, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=637.6s)]
*  you know, a team of parades. The whole thing was just so embarrassing. And quite frankly, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=642.48s)]
*  I think it was offensive to our military to even make them participate in that. And you could tell [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=646.88s)]
*  like they didn't even really want to be there. Like they were doing their best, you know, and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=652.0s)]
*  Trump made them, you know, on on his birthday of all days, co-opting the military's birthday [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=656.0s)]
*  for for his birthday and then doing this parade. And then like it just being a total disaster, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=662.08s)]
*  just a total and complete dud. It was frankly just so embarrassing, honestly, for the country, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=667.2s)]
*  for Trump. The whole thing was just like rough to watch. I gotta say it was the 250th anniversary [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=671.76s)]
*  of the United States Army. Let me be clear about my position. I am all for celebrating the 250th [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=678.72s)]
*  anniversary of the Army. Our grandpa was a tail gunner in the B-29 in World War II. Grandpa Murray [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  passed away over a decade ago, but he would share with us the stories of his heroism and those who [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=694.24s)]
*  he fought along with. And we are major supporters of the United States military here at the Midas [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  Touch Network and those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Brett, as you said, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=708.24s)]
*  though, it should not be co-opted for Donald Trump's vanity for him to do a dictator parade. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=714.24s)]
*  The optics of doing it in Washington, D.C., and trying to mimic the style of authoritarian regimes [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=719.44s)]
*  is very anti-American. But if you were going to do a military parade, at least pull it off. Like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=725.92s)]
*  at least execute it with a level of competence that puts the troops in good light. And if you [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=733.52s)]
*  needed six months, nine months, or a year to kind of execute it properly and to handle the logistics [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=741.36s)]
*  and do a good job, at least like do a good job at it so the troops look good. You know, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=748.88s)]
*  I mean, just watching some of the troops hold the drones above their head. You know, the way I [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  described it was I remember going to Disney World when I was growing up in the early 90s, and they [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=761.36s)]
*  had that Epcot Center ride where you would go into that like big globe and they would like go [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=767.84s)]
*  through the history of the United States and like all the robots and maybe they've updated it since [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  then. But like it would have like all these like weird robots and it just looked so outdated. It [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  would look disorganized and it just it did not look competently executed. And this isn't, you know, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=785.44s)]
*  and then we have these foreign countries now who are mocking the United States. In Russia, they're [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=793.6s)]
*  doing videos mocking the United States. It didn't look good. And I think that's when we talk about [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  like what went down at the G7. When we talk about Trump's disastrous trade war against the world, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=803.6s)]
*  a lot of these issues are not like political things about oh, Democratic views or Republican [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=809.76s)]
*  views. There should be values and principles. Donald Trump has neither. There's no foundational [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  value or principle at all to anything that he's doing. It's just pure chaos and what he thinks [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=820.96s)]
*  benefits him personally in a specific daily news cycle. But doesn't it come down to just like [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=826.32s)]
*  competence and getting the job done and executing what you're saying you're going to do? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=832.96s)]
*  Brett and Jordi, that was one of the things with the parade. It was just poorly done. But to me, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=838.64s)]
*  it's a perfect microcosm of everything wrong with the Trump regime. His authoritarian tendencies, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=843.44s)]
*  that he wants to be an authoritarian, the cacostocracy aspect of it, that it's poorly [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  executed, that they can't even carry it out. And so it makes the entire United States look like a [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=856.0s)]
*  dysfunctional clown show. And it goes beyond even, oh, that's a Republican view or a Democrat view. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=862.72s)]
*  Just what are you even doing? Ben, Ben, Ben, exactly. And Ben, the waste, the waste. I'm [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=871.28s)]
*  seeing numbers that it costs anywhere between $25 to $45 million to operate that parade. Listeners, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=880.32s)]
*  that's your money. It's your taxpayers' money going to waste for what? A dear leader parade? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=887.68s)]
*  That's not even, to your point, Ben, executed well. There needs to be investigations into where that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=895.12s)]
*  money actually, where it was spent. Because that was one of the most pathetic things that I've [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  ever seen. Not that I was rooting for it to be like this glorious show or whatnot, but to spend [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=907.68s)]
*  that much taxpayer money on such a shameful, shameful parade. That makes this even worse to me. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=913.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, I think it was actually far more than that. I think they were hiding the costs [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  in different agencies as well, because $45 million actually seems low to me. But I mean, look, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=928.48s)]
*  take a look at what he did at the G7. So the G7 is currently being held in Alberta, Canada. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=935.92s)]
*  Canada is the host. So Prime Minister Mark Carney, the new Prime Minister of Canada, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=943.12s)]
*  he serves as the chair of the G7. We'll show you clips in a little bit of how it started in the day [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=948.0s)]
*  when Donald Trump and Carney held the press conference. And Trump kept on talking about [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=955.04s)]
*  Putin. He was acting as Putin's agent at the G7. It was really unnerving to the point where Prime [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  Minister Carney had to actually just stop the press conference because Trump was making such a fool of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  himself. And then by proxy, the entire G7 event. So Carney's like, we're shutting this down. But let [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=971.84s)]
*  me show you what happened in the afternoon. So Donald Trump is standing next to the Prime Minister [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=978.0s)]
*  of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer. Donald Trump thinks that the United Kingdom is part of the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=984.24s)]
*  European Union. So Donald Trump believes he just did a deal with the EU, even though you have Prime [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=990.96s)]
*  Minister Keir Starmer from the UK standing next to him. And so Donald Trump says, let's take a look [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=998.56s)]
*  at this trade deal that we did. You should also note that, what was it, three to four weeks ago, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1005.76s)]
*  Donald Trump claimed that they had already did a trade deal with the United Kingdom. Remember, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1010.88s)]
*  we told you they didn't do a deal. It was a memorandum of understanding, which specifically said [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1016.16s)]
*  this is not a binding trade deal. Let me also just let you know that trade deals in general, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1022.96s)]
*  like the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement, they're complex. So an actual trade deal is more [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1029.68s)]
*  than two or three pages in length. An actual trade deal is at least hundreds of pages, usually [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1037.28s)]
*  thousands of pages if it's an actual deal. So it looks like Donald Trump is holding up [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1044.16s)]
*  the same memorandum of understanding that they did three or four weeks ago, the US and the UK, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1050.72s)]
*  if there's even writing on some of these papers. It's unclear one way or another, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  if there's even writing on some of these papers or not. Trump drops it all over the floor in this [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1061.6s)]
*  like cartoonishly clownish moment that you'd expect to see in the movie Idiocracy. Watch this. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1067.68s)]
*  We all know the great prime minister of the UK and we just signed a document. Sorry about that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1074.64s)]
*  Very important document. Little windy out here. Give it to me. We just signed it and it's done. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1085.2s)]
*  And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union. Did you hear that last part? We [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  have a trade agreement with the European Union. Let's play the longer version of that portion [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1098.88s)]
*  where he says we have a trade deal with the European Union. Let's play it. We have our trade [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1105.2800000000002s)]
*  agreement with the European Union and it's a fair deal for both. It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1110.0s)]
*  of income and we have many, many other ones coming. But you see the level of enthusiasm is very good. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  But the relationship that we have is fantastic. So I just want to congratulate you. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1125.76s)]
*  But Donald, thank you very much. This now implements on car tariffs and aerospace [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1130.8s)]
*  our really important agreement. And so this is a very good day for both of our countries, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1137.52s)]
*  a real sign of strength. So thank you again, Donald. A really important day for both of us. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1142.0s)]
*  Great people. Great people. He doesn't even know the people he's dealing with. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1147.28s)]
*  These people know how to play him so well. They just say the exact things they know that they can [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1152.64s)]
*  just do anything they want with this guy. It's incredible. This is besides the point. But did [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1158.8s)]
*  you see his hair also? I mean, I'm focusing on kind of the wrong things here, but he's got like this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1162.16s)]
*  little rat tail on the left side that just kept dangling up and down his head. But that's beside [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1166.48s)]
*  the point. Sorry, Ben. No, by the way, I don't think you're focusing on the wrong things. I think [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1170.8s)]
*  we need to look at all of this. The guy can't hold papers. He can't hold, could you imagine? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1175.04s)]
*  And I'm going to be this guy till the show's over. Could you imagine if Biden was holding [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1180.48s)]
*  papers and you just dropped them? The coverage that it would get on Fox News? It'd be two weeks [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1185.2s)]
*  on Fox. It'd be two weeks on Fox, front page of the New York Post, day after day for an entire [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1190.72s)]
*  week. The guy can't hold papers. He can't keep his hair looking normal. I mean, when we take that, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1195.6s)]
*  when the Dems take back the House during the midterms, there needs to be investigations [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1201.28s)]
*  into who's actually running the White House because Donald Trump is cognitively not all there. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1205.6s)]
*  And I'm not giving him an out. I'm not giving him an out, but he's not all there. And there needs [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1210.4s)]
*  to be more of a focus on his mental acuity or lack thereof because everything he says from his [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1215.92s)]
*  statements that we get to read day in and day out, from the way he operates in front of the leaders, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1222.16s)]
*  from the fact that he doesn't even know who the frick he's talking to. This is insane. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1226.96s)]
*  Nuclear codes. This guy has the nuclear codes. Well, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1231.44s)]
*  you noticed the two things that he was talking about, auto tariffs and aerospace. Who do you [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1236.64s)]
*  think that benefits? Auto tariffs and aerospace. You realize that the memorandum of understanding [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1242.8s)]
*  that dealt with the auto tariffs gives preferential treatment to United Kingdom automakers [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1249.92s)]
*  over United States automanufacturers because there would be a higher tariff rate based on [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1257.04s)]
*  U.S. automanufacturers having factories in Canada and Mexico than it now gives to the United Kingdom [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1263.2s)]
*  for Land Rover, for Jaguar, for Rolls Royce. So it gives benefits to those UK car manufacturers [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1271.84s)]
*  over the United States, which is why Keir Starmer's kind of smile on his face as a [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1280.48s)]
*  wink and a nod that, all right, I know UK people, you hate this guy, but I just got some of the UK [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1285.2s)]
*  manufacturers a better deal than the American manufacturers are getting as well. So then going [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1292.0800000000002s)]
*  through this G7 as well. Oh, during that same press conference, Donald Trump starts attacking [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1298.32s)]
*  Tucker Carlson because Carlson has been critical of Donald Trump trying to embroil United States [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1303.68s)]
*  troops in the Israel Iran war. Here's what Trump has to say about Tucker. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1319.84s)]
*  say it so that people listen. Thank you. We will talk more about the divisions growing in MAGA [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1324.0s)]
*  because we've even seen Steve Bannon and Mike Flynn basically say Donald Trump needs to do [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1331.1999999999998s)]
*  like a press conference immediately and say, what the hell is happening between Israel and Iran? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1337.44s)]
*  And what's America's role in it at all? You even have Marjorie Taylor Greene, although she's not [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1342.4s)]
*  mentioning Donald Trump's name. She goes, we're now learning who's really America first or who's not [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1348.64s)]
*  based on if you support American troops going to war in Iran. And that's actually what Donald Trump [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1353.76s)]
*  has been saying that he wants to do. He's not ruled it out. Not only has he not ruled it out, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1360.0800000000002s)]
*  he's indicated that he's leaning in that direction and it's very much on the table. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1365.28s)]
*  And the US is of course, unofficially helping Israel and all of the coordination and all of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1368.8799999999999s)]
*  the planning. And Israel's out there with Netanyahu and others saying the US is doing everything. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1374.0s)]
*  They're giving us the plans. They're giving us the weapons. This is the US and us together. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1379.52s)]
*  And Donald Trump's not putting out any statements to the contrary when you hear those statements [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1384.32s)]
*  coming out of Israel. So we'll talk about that. But then you had to have Prime Minister Mark [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1389.28s)]
*  Carney of Canada early in the day. This was supposed to be so super simple, right? Donald Trump [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1395.68s)]
*  meets Carney. They're supposed to speak in front of the press for about two minutes tops, say, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1401.52s)]
*  we look forward to a productive G7. That's all it was supposed to be. I look forward to it. I look [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1407.52s)]
*  forward to it. This is going to be productive. We have a lot to discuss. Thank you very much. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1412.64s)]
*  We'll be reporting back to you. That was the moment. That's all it was supposed to be. But [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1417.12s)]
*  Carney had to cut it short because Trump had other intentions for what that was going to be about. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1422.2399999999998s)]
*  Let's play the clip of Carney cutting it short. All Democrat run cities and they think they're [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1426.9599999999998s)]
*  going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen. Thank you. If you don't mind, just, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to exercise my role, if you will, as a G7 chair since we have a few more minutes [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1442.4s)]
*  with the president and his team. And then we actually have to start the meeting to address [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1447.6000000000001s)]
*  some of these big issues. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And do you see, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1451.92s)]
*  for the audio listeners, you can see it for our viewers on YouTube, you can see it. Trump is like [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1461.76s)]
*  standing there. Trump would have stood there for the next hour and would have just kept on [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1467.3600000000001s)]
*  saying the most outrageous things that he was saying. Or for Trump, pretty normal things. He [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1473.76s)]
*  shows up there and Trump was on a mission that he was going to say he wishes Putin was there. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1478.32s)]
*  And you know, because Donald Trump's been talking about having all of these calls with Putin lately, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  including getting advice about what to do in Iran from Putin, you know that Putin probably told [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1488.96s)]
*  Trump, when you're at the G7, let them know that I want to be there and that I should have been [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1494.96s)]
*  there and they shouldn't have disinvited me with Obama and Trudeau. So that's what Donald Trump [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1499.3600000000001s)]
*  says. Trump goes, the G7 used to be the G8. Here, play this clip. Together very well. I look forward [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1504.4s)]
*  to that. The G7 used to be the G8. Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn't want to have [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1510.96s)]
*  Russia in. And I would say that that was a mistake because I think you wouldn't have a war right now [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1518.64s)]
*  if you had Russia in. And you wouldn't have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1523.52s)]
*  But it didn't work out that way. But it used to be the G8. And now it's, I guess, what's that, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  nine years ago, eight years ago, it switched over. They threw Russia out, which I claimed [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1534.96s)]
*  was a very big mistake, even though I wasn't in politics. And then here's what he had to say [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  about Putin as well. Here, play this clip. The biggest economy in the world after the United [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1545.92s)]
*  States. Well, it's not a bad idea. I don't mind that. If somebody wants to suggest China [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1551.12s)]
*  coming in, I think we suggest. But you want to have people that you can talk to. You know, they [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1555.12s)]
*  don't talk to you. Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else. He doesn't want to talk [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1560.24s)]
*  because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8, as I would be, as you would be, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1564.56s)]
*  as anybody would be. He was very insulted. And I mean, he was thrown out by Trudeau, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1569.68s)]
*  who convinced one or two people along with Obama. He was thrown out. And he's not a happy person [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1575.44s)]
*  about it. I can tell you that. He basically doesn't even speak to the people that throw him out. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1583.12s)]
*  And I agree with him. I want to talk about that moment right there. Yet another humiliating stain [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1589.76s)]
*  on the United States of America. We'll talk about that. I want to talk about the No Kings [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1599.44s)]
*  protests a little more. I want to talk about the war between Israel and Iran and what the United [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1604.48s)]
*  States is doing, how MAGA is really pissed that Donald Trump is pushing to have American troops [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1610.16s)]
*  fight in that war. Before we go to our first break, we got some we got we got a fun one right here [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1615.76s)]
*  to try to grow this network. We are releasing California Governor Gavin Newsom emojis. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1621.92s)]
*  Lots of people have been saying in light of Gavin Newsom standing up to Donald Trump and standing [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1630.0s)]
*  up strong people have been saying, release the Gavin Newsom emojis to our members of our YouTube [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1635.6s)]
*  channel. So if we can get 500 more memberships on our YouTube, you could also gift memberships [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1641.44s)]

*  California Governor Newsom emoji will be unlocked. Let's take our first quick break of the show. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1685.92s)]
*  We've got a lot to discuss when we return. When was the last time that you truly trusted seafood [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1690.4s)]
*  you brought home? Now I used to question everything from nutrition and taste to sustainability until [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1698.72s)]

*  from the Wild Alaskan Company. I received my Pacific halibut and pan seared it that evening. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1719.2s)]
*  It was delicious. The Wild Alaskan Company is 100% wild caught, never farmed. This means there are [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1724.4s)]
*  no antibiotics, GMOs or additives, just clean real fish that support healthy oceans and fishing [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1731.28s)]
*  communities. It's nutrient rich and full of flavor. Wild Alaskan fish is frozen off the boat to lock [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1737.44s)]
*  in taste, texture and nutrients like omega-3s. My favorite, it's also sustainably sourced. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1743.76s)]

*  way to wake up feeling fresh after drinks with friends, it's with pre-alcohol. Zbiotic's pre-alcohol [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
*  probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. It was invented by PhD [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1797.76s)]
*  scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. Now here's how it works. When you drink alcohol [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1803.2s)]
*  gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. Now it's a buildup of this byproduct, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1808.32s)]
*  not dehydration. That's to blame for rough days after drinking. Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1813.76s)]
*  to break this byproduct down. Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1820.16s)]
*  drink responsibly, and you'll feel your best tomorrow. Now every time I've had pre-alcohol [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1825.92s)]
*  before drinks, I notice a difference the next day. Now even after a night out, I can confidently [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1831.92s)]
*  plan on just waking up and feeling my best the next day without worrying. Look, I won't lie, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1836.56s)]
*  I was a bit on the fence about pre-alcohol initially, but then while hanging out with [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1841.44s)]
*  some friends at our bar, I gave it a shot and believe me, it's the real deal. So I first gave [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  pre-alcohol a try when I was at a wedding. I drank it before my first espresso martini and you wouldn't [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1850.56s)]
*  believe how on top of my game I felt the next morning. Now summer's here, which means more [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1855.76s)]

*  the show, does that count towards the 500 for the Gavin emoji? Yes, of course it does. But mods, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1936.0s)]
*  I'm really going to rely on y'all to make sure that we are staying true to the count. So let's [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1941.6s)]
*  just say, I think we have about 400 more memberships to go in order to unlock the Gavin [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1946.96s)]
*  emoji. So gift them or do whatever. Let's get to 400 new memberships now to unlock the Gavin emoji [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1953.2s)]
*  and mods. I'm going to really rely heavily on you to make sure you're holding us honest with the [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1960.8s)]
*  counting. Benji, where to next? Look, Trump's really making a fool of not just himself, but the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1965.3600000000001s)]
*  United States at the G7. I mean, you have the incredibly embarrassing dictator parade, then he [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1971.76s)]
*  goes to the G7 and behaves like this. California governor Gavin Newsom has been saying, and I think [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1980.08s)]
*  rightfully so, it goes to your point, Jordy, that Donald Trump is cognitively addled. He is. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1988.4s)]
*  And in a very real way, that's also impacting American policy too. And Donald Trump's out there [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=1994.72s)]
*  with a team of losers who he surrounds himself with as well. And he's out there like a mumbling, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2001.6s)]
*  blabbering fool saying things that are putting the United States in a very bad light internationally [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2008.88s)]
*  and weakening us on the world stage at every point and every turn. I mean, going back to [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2017.2s)]
*  this press conference that Donald Trump was having with Prime Minister Carney, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2023.28s)]
*  Donald Trump spends the time attacking democratic cities as though he's in the past. He obviously [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2027.6s)]
*  is a dictator right now, but as though this would normally expect a dictator talking about [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2037.12s)]
*  invading a neighboring country. Donald Trump's at the G7 talking about attacking United States [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2042.8799999999999s)]
*  cities. And then at first you'll see when he gets asked the question, he doesn't remember [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2050.64s)]
*  the social media posts that he made. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Oh, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2056.48s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. The cities. I'm going after the cities. Here, watch this. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2060.72s)]
*  Why are you ordering ICE to target democratic inner cities? What's the plan? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2064.64s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2067.92s)]
*  You did a post last night where you said you want ICE to really target Democrats? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2069.2s)]
*  Yeah, I want them to focus on the cities because the cities are where you really have what's called [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2072.72s)]
*  sanctuary cities, and that's where the people are. I look at New York, I look at Chicago. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2077.2s)]
*  I mean, you got a really bad governor in Chicago and a bad mayor, but the governor is probably [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2082.0s)]
*  the worst in the country, Pritzker. But I look at how that city has been overrun by criminals and, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2086.96s)]
*  you know, New York and LA, look at LA. LA, those people weren't from LA. They weren't from California, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2094.08s)]
*  most of those people, many of those people. And yeah, that's a focus. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2099.8399999999997s)]
*  Biden allowed 21 million people to come into our country. Of that, vast numbers of those people [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2104.48s)]
*  were murderers, killers, people from gangs, people from jails, they emptied their jails out into the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2112.7200000000003s)]
*  U.S. Most of those people are in the cities, all blue cities, all Democrat run cities, and they [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2118.88s)]
*  think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2125.84s)]
*  He's using a speech, a press conference, in an international platform to spread Russian-style [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2128.24s)]
*  propaganda lies about the United States. I mean, can you imagine if Prime Minister Carney, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2140.4799999999996s)]
*  during a press conference, spent his time attacking provinces in Canada and going after, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2149.92s)]
*  you know, where there's opposition leaders who run, like, imagine if he went after, like, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2159.76s)]
*  Alberta and then lied and said there are 18 million, that's more than the population of Canada, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2163.92s)]
*  but if he said there was, you know, a million murderers in Alberta and it's the, you have the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2168.96s)]
*  worst premiere of Alberta and, you know, and what a horrible person, what a horrible human being, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2175.04s)]
*  and spent all of their time attacking their own country with lies. And what are you saying, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2182.64s)]
*  that there are 20 million murderers in the United States? Like, what the hell are you even talking [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2188.24s)]
*  about? And you should know that actually red states, red cities, have a significantly higher [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2192.64s)]
*  violent crime rate and homicide rate than blue states, by far. You should also know that in [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2199.2s)]
*  America the red states are subsidized, by and large, by the blue states. California has the fourth [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2204.72s)]
*  largest GDP, not in the United States, in the entire world, if California was a country. Our [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2211.12s)]
*  diversity makes California a very powerful state. It works. We subsidize in California the red states, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2217.2s)]
*  which would be failed states if California and other blue states didn't fund them. The red states, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2225.2799999999997s)]
*  by and large, have the worst health, have the worst mortality rates, have the worst quality of [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2231.2s)]
*  living, the worst education. On every stat, they're in the worst on the lists and the blue states are [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2237.2s)]
*  usually in the highest and the best. But yet you have Trump and the red states attacking the states [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2245.44s)]
*  that are subsidizing basically the entire country and also doing it on a world stage with lies like [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2252.64s)]
*  an attacking, just attacking America in the G7 while praising Putin. That shouldn't be a, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2259.28s)]
*  oh, that's a this position. That's just wrong, Brett and Jordi, a might is mighty. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2266.4s)]
*  Yeah, if you looked at, if any sort of democratic politician anywhere made it a main point of when [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2271.2000000000003s)]
*  they went around speaking, especially in front of world leaders, but literally anytime, if they did [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2277.36s)]
*  one tweet that was going after red states, red cities, saying, you know, this specific place is [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2281.36s)]
*  a piece of crap, this place is full of criminals, you name it, it would be the biggest story [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2287.68s)]
*  imaginable. And when you look at Donald Trump's statements there and Jordi, I mean, you're totally [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2292.24s)]
*  right. You look at the guy, he has no idea what's going on. Like I think he's honestly, I think that [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2296.24s)]
*  party, you know, his little birthday party destroyed him like that nobody showed up. I mean, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2300.3999999999996s)]
*  honestly, something's going on there. But you look at his post, and we don't have to read this whole [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2304.3999999999996s)]
*  post because it's like the manifesto of a killer. And we'll get to more stuff about it. Right. This [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2307.8399999999997s)]
*  looks like a man, like a manifesto right here. Like a psychopath. Well, you know, I guess it is. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2314.56s)]
*  But you look at it and it basically declares war. It's a post of Trump declaring war on blue states [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2320.7999999999997s)]
*  and blue cities. And it's him calling it out like directly, like he's not even trying to hide it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2327.44s)]
*  Like remember how in his first term, Donald Trump announced that he was doing a Muslim ban, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2332.0s)]
*  and then he had to peel it back. And now he just calls it a travel ban that happens to include [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2336.88s)]
*  mostly Muslim countries, but he doesn't call it the Muslim ban anymore. Well, Trump didn't quite [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2340.8s)]
*  learn his lesson from the trouble he got into with that. Now he's just saying out loud, I'm [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2344.7200000000003s)]
*  targeting democratic cities and democratic power centers. I want to come for you Democrats. I want [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2348.6400000000003s)]
*  to try to scare your people away from your cities. I want to try to, you know, arrest people in your [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2353.28s)]
*  cities. I want to make your cities hell. That's what he is saying in this post. He literally says, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2358.6400000000003s)]
*  he goes, you turning everybody transgender. He says you, you do transgender for everybody. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2362.8s)]
*  And that's why we need ice to disappear human beings because you're turning everybody into [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2368.72s)]
*  transgender. I mean, what the hell is that? It's literally, it's literally what it says here. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2374.24s)]
*  And as somebody who resides in Los Angeles and who grew up in New York, like I certainly take [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  extra offense to all of these comments, especially somebody who's living in this incredible city, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2385.9199999999996s)]
*  and was out. And I got to say, there was such an, I was like out in the heart of the city this [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2390.56s)]
*  weekend. And there was such an anti-Trump energy out there as the night before the protest, as I [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2395.36s)]
*  passed by bars, you know, you'd hear comedians on the mics, all the comedians trashing Trump, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2399.44s)]
*  trashing ice, posters all over the city. I saw these horrifying photos that people were putting [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2405.52s)]
*  up. And then I think you talked about these in some of your videos. I wish I had a photo to pull [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2412.1600000000003s)]
*  up right now, but you know, it looked like a dystopian movie. They would be like missing [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2416.4s)]
*  posters, right? And, but it would say missing, you know, father, you know, my father. And it [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2420.24s)]
*  would say, you know, has lived in the United States for 20 years, you know, was here legally [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  through the asylum process, currently in ICE custody. We don't know where he is and had an image [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2429.6s)]
*  of these, you know, image of the individual. And there were multiple posters like this all throughout, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, LA. And when you see it, you know, it's, it almost looks like it's a, like a street team [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2439.2s)]
*  advertisement for like a, for like a dystopian movie or like a Nazi movie, but you look at it [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2445.52s)]
*  and you're like, this is real life, like, and this is, and this is going on. And, and you walk [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2450.88s)]
*  through, you know, our cities here and you just see the damage that Trump is causing and the trauma [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2454.96s)]
*  that Trump is causing here. And, and honestly, just at a deeply personal level, you know, it's, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2460.96s)]
*  it's all, it's all very upsetting to me. None of this stuff should be partisan. None of this should [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2466.96s)]
*  be political. And we'll get into the, you know, the shooting in a little bit, because I have a [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2471.52s)]
*  whole lot to say on that, you know, as well, but, you know, there were certain things that there [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2477.36s)]
*  are things that have been going on for a long time in this country and particularly this weekend, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2482.0s)]
*  you know, it felt escalated even more that just, you know, there's politics and there's humanity [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2485.92s)]
*  and you should be able to conduct politics and deal with people who have different political beliefs [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2492.24s)]
*  and do it with compassion and do it with empathy. And you should be able to respect one another [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2499.52s)]
*  and be able to work through things. But the way things are right now, it's just really unfortunate [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2504.96s)]
*  that we have an entire political party that's just dedicated to burning it all down, dedicated to [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2509.36s)]
*  turning any of their political opponents into enemies, lying at all costs, even no matter how [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2515.2s)]
*  ridiculous the lie, how absurd the lie, how offensive the lie, even when there are people [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2520.8s)]
*  dying out there over these lies. It just really, really, really honestly is just so [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2526.0s)]
*  abhorrent to watch and to live through and to be a part of. So, you know, I just wanted to say that. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2531.84s)]
*  I got more to say, but we'll- No, no, no. Well said. Well said. Can you please bring up, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2537.28s)]
*  Brad, that post again that we were showing before? And so again, apologies to our audience. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2541.68s)]
*  The psychopathic post? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to read it, but I just want our YouTube [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2546.08s)]
*  viewers to just look at this. Now I want you to go to your Facebook. And I'm sure just naturally [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2551.04s)]
*  the way Facebook happens, you know, there's going to be a cousin, a third cousin, a fourth cousin, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2557.36s)]
*  who writes like this, right? Who does these weirdo, long, drawn out, frankly scary posts. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2562.48s)]
*  All right, Brad, you can take that down now. And think to yourself, thank goodness that that third [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2569.92s)]
*  cousin of yours or that random person you know isn't running the country. Well, in this case, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2576.48s)]
*  that psychopath is. And he's disappearing people. He's disappearing pillars of the community. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2582.72s)]
*  Why? Because he's a psychopath. That's why. Why? Because for some reason, the Supreme Court gave [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2591.2s)]
*  him the power to do whatever the heck he wants. And this is not just trauma right now, today. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2597.2s)]
*  This is going to be generational trauma that's felt within this country for just the total lack [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2603.12s)]
*  of empathy that the Trump regime just dishes out day in and day out. It is really just horrifying [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2609.68s)]
*  from a human level to see this play out. And that's why too, that's why I do get hopeful [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2619.04s)]
*  when I see folks on the ground during the no kings parade marching peacefully, protesting, saying, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2626.48s)]
*  uh-uh, this is not the America that I love. This is not the country that I love. And these will not [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2634.48s)]
*  happen to the good citizens and the good people of this country. We will not allow it. Yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2640.64s)]
*  One of the things in that post, on the page two of the post, because Trump goes on single space, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2646.8s)]
*  ranting and raving, he talks about the Pentagon, meaning our Defense Department and our military, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2652.64s)]
*  that you have the full support to go into these, what he calls democratic power centers. He says [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2659.2s)]
*  to ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, the Patriots at the Pentagon and the State Department, get the job done, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2664.56s)]
*  DJT, where then he talks about the democratic power centers turning everybody into transgender [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2671.8399999999997s)]
*  people. By the way, that's the exact same type of rhetoric that Vladimir Putin uses when he targets [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2678.08s)]
*  countries for invasion. That's the language that he uses. One of the things that was very important [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2685.12s)]
*  to every other country at the G7, other than the United States, was deescalation of what was [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2690.48s)]
*  happening in the Middle East. Israel launched preemptive strikes against Iran. And then Benjamin [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2695.92s)]
*  Netanyahu said, we did this with the full support of the Trump regime. And this is what Netanyahu [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2701.68s)]
*  said, that all of Donald Trump's statements that he was trying to negotiate peace with Iran and do [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2707.44s)]
*  a nuclear deal, that was all part of the plot. That was part of the plan to trick Iran into believing [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2713.68s)]
*  that there wasn't going to be a preemptive strike and to lure Iran on into thinking there could be [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2720.4s)]
*  some sort of deal. Wait for Iran's generals to be in certain areas, decapitate them, then go after [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  the nuclear facilities. Donald Trump didn't rebut any of that at all. The G7 countries, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2734.32s)]
*  other than the United States, they wanted to sign a pledge to deescalate. Trump refused to sign the [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2741.44s)]
*  pledge to deescalate. Instead, at the G7, Donald Trump made the following post. Iran should have [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2747.52s)]
*  signed the quote, deal. I told them to sign. What a shame and waste of human life. Simply stated, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2753.84s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again, everyone should immediately [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2762.0s)]
*  evacuate Tehran. And he has an exclamation point right there. And again, even a statement like that, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2768.0s)]
*  I can't begin to tell you how utterly reckless it is. This is the type of thing where you should [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2775.28s)]
*  absolutely, before posting a statement like that, you give the address to the nation, you explain [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2782.48s)]
*  the goals, the policies, because you're about to commit American troops. It could possibly lead to [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2788.64s)]
*  another American draft. You could be having tens of thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2794.96s)]
*  of Americans being sent to war because of this. And having clearly defined goals is important. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it is also significant to note that there was supposed to be negotiations around Iran's [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2807.44s)]
*  nuclear deal on Sunday. That was supposed to be the sixth round of talk on Sunday. So to say there [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2814.56s)]
*  should have been a deal, I would like there to be a deal. There was a deal that Obama negotiated with [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2822.4s)]
*  Iran that Trump pulled us out of with Netanyahu back in 2016. There was a deal and Trump was [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2828.4s)]
*  trying to redo a version of that deal. The sixth round of those talks were going to happen on Sunday. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2835.2s)]
*  All of the reporting indicated that Donald Trump actually had told Netanyahu, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2842.32s)]
*  do not do the strikes so that we can do the talks on Sunday. Netanyahu didn't care and he went and [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2846.56s)]
*  did the strikes. Donald Trump saw that a lot of the Iranian leadership was killed and decapitated [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2853.04s)]
*  by the Israel strikes and nuclear facilities were taken out. So Donald Trump wanted to then insert [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2859.2000000000003s)]
*  himself and the United States as the central player in the attacks against Iran. And now we're [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2865.2s)]
*  in a place and position where we're in entirely unchartered territory about what could happen if [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2872.56s)]
*  all hell could break loose, which is already happening, and what's taking place there. And [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2879.68s)]
*  that's Donald Trump's just entirely reckless statement. We should talk more about that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2884.16s)]
*  Brett, I want you to talk about the fact check that you did in terms of what happened in Minnesota. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2889.52s)]
*  I think that's important. I want to talk a little bit more about no kings. Let's take our last break [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2895.04s)]
*  of the show. I want to remind everybody about the Gavin Newsom emojis. Let's unlock those Gavin [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2900.72s)]
*  Newsom emojis as well. Become a member of the YouTube channel. It helps grow our independent [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2907.44s)]
*  media network. We're close to five million subscribers. You can gift memberships for people. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2914.16s)]
*  So if you've always been saying, hey, I'd love to help grow the Midas Touch Network, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2919.92s)]
*  there's really no limit on the amount of gifts that you can get people. So you can gift others, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2924.16s)]
*  get yourself a membership, and then YouTube automatically then sends your gift to other [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2929.92s)]
*  people who are there who say they want to receive the gifts. All right, let's take our last quick [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2935.2s)]
*  break of the show. Let's hear from our program. Can I just say one thing? This whole framing, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2939.8399999999997s)]
*  though, of preemptive strike to me is just bullshit. And I think it's buying the media [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2944.3199999999997s)]
*  framing and stuff. So I just want to push back on that. There was no sign that there was about to [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2949.6s)]
*  be an imminent attack on Israel before they launched these things. They're using the nuclear, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2954.0s)]
*  the idea that they were creating nuclear weapons, which is something we've now heard for what, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2958.4s)]
*  decades and decades and decades. And I believe that they've been working on nuclear weapons, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2962.08s)]
*  of course. But there was no sign that there was going to be any sort of imminent attack [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2966.88s)]
*  whatsoever. And now this appears to be a war that we are now going to be embroiled in. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2970.88s)]
*  We saw a buildup of fighter jets last night and today that were flying across the United States [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2976.24s)]
*  into Europe to prepare. And the Trump administration told some foreign outlets [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  that they were to prepare just in case they had to do anything, that these foreign jets, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2988.08s)]
*  that these US fighter jets were going to be built up over there in case they needed to go into Iran. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2991.8399999999997s)]
*  We are already very much involved in this war from a defensive posture of shooting down missiles [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=2998.24s)]
*  that are coming into Israel. And it seems pretty clear that Donald Trump and Vance and Rubio and [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3003.8399999999997s)]
*  all these folks want to escalate this and really get us fully embroiled in yet another Middle East [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3010.32s)]
*  war. So I just wanted to push back a little at that framing because I think it's kind of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3015.6800000000003s)]
*  bullshit. And I think Donald Trump has using kind of the same excuses that Bush used us to get us [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3020.48s)]
*  into Iraq back in the day. It's sort of like a WMD, weapons of mass destruction kind of framing that [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3026.8s)]
*  he's pushing, that Fox is pushing, Fox is in full on bloodthirsty, war, war, war, war, war, all the [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3032.4s)]
*  time mode right now. And you watch it and I just get echoes back to those times after 9-11 when we [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3037.84s)]
*  were kind of as a country brought into Iraq and we all saw how that worked out. And yeah, I mean, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3043.2000000000003s)]
*  that I'll end it there. I got a lot more to say. No, and real quick, and this is where real leaders, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3052.8s)]
*  this is why leadership is actually very important because we need to know what's going on. All the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3057.52s)]
*  speculation, he's giving policy by tweet. I mean, look, to one end, right, I understand that there [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3061.44s)]
*  has to be some secrecy behind all of this, but right now the entire country is left in the dark [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3068.7200000000003s)]
*  of what's happening other than the reports that we're seeing coming out on Twitter or XYZ social [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3074.0s)]
*  media asset. The guy comments about every little thing all the time. He's tweets about everything, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3079.28s)]
*  every celebrity breakup, he's about Taylor Swift, he tweets about everything. And then the moment [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3084.88s)]
*  this all happens, he kind of goes silent for a few days. And we're going to talk to the rest of the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3090.32s)]
*  lives on the line. So we're going to hit our last quick break. Chat's telling me, by the way, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3094.4s)]
*  that we're about 150 new members away from unlocking the Gavin emoji. So let's see if we [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3101.84s)]
*  can hit the 150 members. Again, you could give them to folks. Let's see if we can hit that during [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  the break. And then when we come back from break, assuming we hit it, the Gavin emoji will be [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3112.0800000000004s)]

*  I was a little bit worried. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3466.16s)]
*  It's all good. You went about an incredible job with or without me. All right. Let me show you how [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3468.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's, I wouldn't even just say war mongering, just all out commitment to war in [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3474.88s)]
*  the Middle East and seeming commitment to sending United States forces into the Middle East, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3481.36s)]
*  how that's playing out in MAGA world. You have to remember, I mean, Donald Trump's whole thing was [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3485.6800000000003s)]
*  lying that he was going to stop World War III. And one of their main points that they kept on [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3490.6400000000003s)]
*  lying about former President Biden about is saying that Biden's going to start World War III and [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3495.76s)]
*  Biden's going to do another war in the Middle East. But actually, former President Biden was [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3500.48s)]
*  the one who had the courage to withdraw American troops, for example, from Afghanistan and end that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3504.88s)]
*  never-ending war after Donald Trump was the one who cut a deal releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3510.32s)]
*  during Trump's first term and then withdrawing Americans from most of the bases other than one, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3517.36s)]
*  basically allowing the Taliban to surround the United States of America. Donald Trump claimed [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3524.1600000000003s)]
*  he was going to withdraw the American troops himself during his first term. Not only did he [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3530.8s)]
*  fail to do it, remember, during the transition to President Biden, Trump refused to provide any [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3535.2s)]
*  communications at all with the Biden administration on any topic to purposefully have Biden show up [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3540.8799999999997s)]
*  and then inherit a mess that Trump and MAGA could use and exploit to then spread all the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3547.7599999999998s)]
*  disinformation and blame all of Donald Trump's problems on Biden. And Brett, in a little bit, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3554.56s)]
*  I know you're going to talk about this disinformation right-wing network, but you [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3560.0s)]
*  also saw that on full display when it came to the wildfires as well. I mean, when it comes to the [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3564.08s)]
*  most unthinkable tragedies, and we saw that over and over again in the Biden administration, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3569.6s)]
*  that's because they're unthinkable tragedies. Most people who are dealing with them don't think, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3574.16s)]
*  oh, where I've got to spend a lot of my time and perhaps the majority of my time is not dealing [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3582.08s)]
*  with the tragedy and the crisis. It's that I've got to swat away and fight off all of the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3588.24s)]
*  disinformation. And there's no low to what the right-wing MAGA Trumpers will say. I mean, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3594.0s)]
*  you think about Nancy Pelosi's husband, victim of attempted murder. What does MAGA say? He's gay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3601.12s)]
*  He's a homosexual who invited the murderer over because they were having gay sex. And then that's [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3607.52s)]
*  why they were trying to kill the guy because it was an elaborate homosexual sex thing. And it's like, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3613.04s)]
*  that's the conspiracy. The guy was almost killed, and you're making a lie that Nancy Pelosi's [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3621.04s)]
*  husband was having an affair with the killer. It's unthinkable things that they make up in [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3626.8s)]
*  their mind. They talk about the wildfires. They act like Gavin tried to do it intentionally, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3633.12s)]
*  and then they spread the lies that, oh, the real issue here was that Gavin turned away, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3638.32s)]
*  people raking the leaves, and that Gavin was the one who took away all the water from the dams. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3644.2400000000002s)]
*  And they spread this. And if you don't respond to them right away and rebut them, then it actually [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3651.52s)]
*  becomes the story, and corporate news doesn't fact check it. So now I think that people like [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3657.6800000000003s)]
*  Gavin and independent news, you have to kick into high gear right away. And Brett, I know you'll talk [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3662.48s)]
*  about the moment you have this Trump supporting murdering right-wing extremists have a list of [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3667.44s)]
*  Democrats he's going to kill, including the second most prominent Democratic state representative [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3672.96s)]
*  in Minnesota. The Republican conspiracy was, no, this is a Democrat. This was a leftist murderer [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3679.68s)]
*  who's doing a far-left Marxist agenda. And then you had mega Republican senators and Congress [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3685.84s)]
*  members out there spreading that lie. I want to pass that to you. But Brett, I do want to show [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3692.4s)]
*  this clip first about how the Trump's war footing in Iran is impacting MAGA right here. So here's [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3696.24s)]
*  Steve Bannon with Mike Flynn. You don't really get more Trump supporting than Bannon and Flynn. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3704.9599999999996s)]
*  And here's their take on Donald Trump getting America involved in the war between Israel and [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3712.4799999999996s)]
*  Iran. Here, play this clip. Right now, I'll be blunt. This is just as sloppy, just as ill thought [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3717.7599999999998s)]
*  through, just as lack of precision as Afghanistan and how we started there in Iraq as we started [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3724.16s)]
*  there. And quite frankly, the Fox News team and the pom poms up, we played on the cold open the [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3730.16s)]
*  other day, shock and awe, shock and awe, shock and awe. When Fox was up there with the pom poms, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3734.96s)]
*  we are inexorably drawn into a conflict that we're not making clear decisions about now. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3740.08s)]
*  If we're going to be in this... Yeah, so let me jump in, Steve. Let me jump in. Let me jump in. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3746.08s)]
*  You're on a diatribe there. That's fine. Here's what Trump needs to do. Okay? What Donald Trump [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3750.96s)]
*  needs to do, and I understand the celebration in Washington, D.C. and the parade and all this [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3757.2799999999997s)]
*  wonderful stuff. Happy birthday, Army. I got it. What Donald Trump needs to do, President Donald [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3761.2799999999997s)]
*  J. Trump needs to do is he needs to go to the podium with very, I mean, very clear objectives [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3765.92s)]
*  about what the hell we're doing. And I mean, none of this, I got special envoys doing this. I got [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3771.2799999999997s)]
*  special envoys doing that. Very clear objectives. Tell the American people this... Right. Then you [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3777.12s)]
*  have over here a podcaster and frequent Joe Rogan guest and big Trump supporter, Dave Smith, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3784.4s)]
*  saying the following about Trump's Iran policy. Play this clip. ...about coming back to the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3791.68s)]
*  negotiating table. It's like sitting after Pearl Harbor and telling FDR, now is the time to go [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3796.4s)]
*  negotiate with the Japanese. Negotiations are over now. The time for negotiations was before this. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3801.92s)]
*  And so, yeah, Donald Trump looks and man, I supported him this last year. I apologize for [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3807.76s)]
*  doing so. It was a bad calculation at the time. It seemed like the right one. But he should be [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3813.36s)]
*  impeached and removed for this one. And not on some ridiculous Nancy Pelosi. Impeached and removed [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3818.7200000000003s)]
*  for this one. Brett, let me toss it over to you because I know you called for the resignation of [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3827.04s)]
*  MAGA Republican Senator Mike Lee as well. And your call for his resignation went viral. And I think [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3832.88s)]
*  what we saw happen in Minnesota, the unthinkable tragedy speaks to some larger issues that [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3840.16s)]
*  independent media has to combat media literacy in general and the moment that we're in. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3845.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, we saw a horrifying killing this weekend in cold blood. And it was at the hands of [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3850.8799999999997s)]
*  this far right MAGA Trump voting guy, Trump supporter, who had a hit list of 70 Democratic [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3858.8799999999997s)]
*  targets, who killed Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, who shot State [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3868.0s)]
*  Senator John Hoffman and his wife, who killed Melissa Hortman's dog, who also tried to show up [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3874.64s)]
*  to multiple other Democratic lawmakers' homes and was not able to get in, the Fed said. Today had a [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3882.24s)]
*  list, like I said, of a bunch of other targets, was targeting pro-abortion activists, was targeting [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3888.64s)]
*  pro-abortion clinics, and was an evangelical guy. And literally the killing happened, the assassination [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3895.68s)]
*  happened, and that wasn't horrifying enough for us all to basically wake up that morning to this [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3904.08s)]
*  horrific news. And honestly, I'm sorry if I have trouble getting through this. I'm honestly, I'm [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3909.76s)]
*  still very distraught by this and shaken up by even just the reaction that's unfolded online about [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3913.2s)]
*  this. But you see what happened there. And then the first thing that happens is these click farms, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3919.76s)]
*  these right-wing MAGA influencer types all rush into gear to try to shape the narrative. They don't [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3927.36s)]
*  wait for the facts. They don't wait for the truth. They just go, how do we start spinning this in [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3933.5200000000004s)]
*  order to blame this on Democrats, to blame this on the left, to wash our hands of it, and to make [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3939.2000000000003s)]
*  sure that this is a liability for them? Once again, everybody targeted that people killed [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3944.96s)]
*  Democrats. Governor Tim Walz targeted on this hit list as well. Well, they had the nerve to blame [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3950.56s)]
*  Tim Walz on this. That was the first thing that they did because this individual who was the [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3956.7200000000003s)]
*  shooter, who was the suspect, Vance Bolter, was somebody who people knew. And he was on an advisory [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3961.76s)]
*  board, a nonpartisan advisory board with no actual power that the governor had put together. And this [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3969.04s)]
*  was a holdover from the previous governor, Governor Dayton, also a Democrat. And it was a [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3975.12s)]
*  bipartisan commission that has to be made up of both Republicans and Democrats. And this was just [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3979.36s)]
*  one of like 50 people on this commission. And Walz just reappointed the person to this position, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3983.36s)]
*  didn't know who he was. But it's just a bipartisan, very basic thing. So they tried to use that little [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3988.56s)]
*  kernel of information in order to try to blame this on Tim Walz and blame this on Democrats, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3993.6800000000003s)]
*  despite the fact that Democrats were assassinated for their political beliefs. And they've [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=3999.6s)]
*  conjured this whole story, oh, they probably shot these people because they voted on this bill [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4005.44s)]
*  against the Democrats. They went against them. So they were punishing them for voting against them. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4011.12s)]
*  And then it wasn't even true of like at all. Like it was just a made up thing. They invented their [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4015.04s)]
*  own narrative. And then very quickly, the facts started to come out. But they had already set [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4020.88s)]
*  these traps, set this narrative out there. But that didn't stop them from tweeting and their [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4026.24s)]
*  refusal to even admit that they were wrong. This is like the other day, but obviously much worse [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4030.7999999999997s)]
*  than that, when all of these MAGA influencers, you know, when Gavin, when Donald Trump said, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4035.68s)]
*  I spoke to Gavin Newsom yesterday and Gavin Newsom said, I did not speak to Donald Trump yesterday. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4040.72s)]
*  And then they showed the call logs, which showed that Gavin and Trump had talked like four days [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4046.3199999999997s)]
*  prior to that. And then all those MAGA influencers just kept saying that was yesterday, that was [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4051.2s)]
*  yesterday. They wouldn't drop the lie, even though it was a black and white, no gray area here. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4056.56s)]
*  Well, this is obviously ramped up on a different level because there are lives here. They're like, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4060.96s)]
*  we're talking about people who died. We're talking about two children who no longer have their [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4064.64s)]
*  parents because this evil, heinous monster killed their parents. And you have people like Elon Musk, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4068.32s)]
*  who have the nerve to tweet stuff like this. The far left is murderously violent. You have people [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4075.36s)]
*  like Mike Lee, a United States Senator, tweeting about it, making jokes about it, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4080.88s)]
*  saying stuff like, this is what happens when Marxists don't get their way and showing a [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4087.04s)]
*  photograph of the killer. The killer was wearing a mask, is wearing a mask in this photo, something [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4091.92s)]
*  straight out of a horror movie. This is the killer as he approached the door. Then you have him, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4096.0s)]
*  you know, blaming Mike Waltz, all these people. I mean, Tim Walz. You have all these people blaming [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4101.68s)]
*  Tim Walz for it. And it's really just so disheartening that we cannot even be on the same [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4106.48s)]
*  plane of reality when we're dealing with issues like this. And especially when we're dealing with [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4112.48s)]
*  people who died and murders and killings, politically charged killings. We've truly just [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4116.32s)]
*  lost our way as a country when this is what's going on here. And like I said earlier in the episode, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4121.44s)]
*  I wish there was a Republican party that I could say, you know what, maybe you have some good ideas [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4126.879999999999s)]
*  on this and let's discuss, you know, let's, maybe there are some compromise that we could find on [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4131.839999999999s)]
*  these issues. And you know what, you're right about this, but you know, you're very off about [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4135.68s)]
*  this. I'm going to defend this to the end. And we could have actual discussions about policy. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4138.72s)]
*  But the thing that we've seen is that these people don't live in reality. And then they don't care [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4143.04s)]
*  about reality. They just care about raw power and they don't care how many lives are on the other [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4148.56s)]
*  end of it. They just don't give a shit at all. Like it's just all about lying. And so you had [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4152.8s)]
*  Tina Smith today, the Minnesota Senator, thankfully, you know, and props to her. She, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4157.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, was looking for a Senator Mike Lee. She's the other Senator from the state. And she [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4163.68s)]
*  confronted Mike Lee. And here's a photograph of him confronting her. And look at that keyboard warrior, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4168.88s)]
*  you know, look, look at how, you know, hunched over he is, you know, for the listeners. It's [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4173.92s)]
*  Mike Lee, like with his hands on his hips and he's kind of hunched over, looking disheveled. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4178.4800000000005s)]
*  And as the Democrats said, when they posted this photo, no screens to hide behind. Let's see him [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4182.56s)]
*  defend his disgusting tweets to Senator Tina Smith's face. And Tina Smith's staff wrote a [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4187.6s)]
*  very powerful, you know, email to Senator Lee's staff. I think I should just read like at least [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4193.84s)]
*  a little bit of it, because I think it really centers just this whole situation and what's [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4200.0s)]
*  been going on. And I'm happy somebody is saying this, you know, directly to him. But they said [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4203.92s)]
*  the following. A note from Senator Smith's deputy chief. I knew Melissa Hortman. Many people in this [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4209.84s)]
*  office did. She was a longtime friend of Senator Smith's who had seen her hours before she was [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4214.64s)]
*  murdered. So you'll forgive my candor as I speak through enormous grief. It is important for your [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4218.64s)]
*  office to know how much additional pain you've caused on an unspeakably horrific weekend. I'm [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4222.56s)]
*  not sure what compelled you or your boss to say any of those things, which in addition to being [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4227.04s)]
*  unconscionable may also well be untrue. Also may very well be untrue, but that is not the point. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4230.8s)]
*  Why would you use the awesome power of United States Senate Office to compound people's grief? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4236.72s)]
*  Is that how your team measure success using the office of a U.S. Senator to post not just one, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4240.8s)]
*  but a series of jokes about an assassination? Is that a successful day of work on Team Lee? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4244.96s)]
*  Did you come into the office on Monday and feel proud of the work you did over the weekend? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4249.68s)]
*  Let's recap Saturday so you fully understand what Minnesota was going through. Melissa Hortman and [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4253.04s)]
*  her husband were murdered. Senator Hoffman and his wife were shot numerous times and remain [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4257.12s)]
*  hospitalized. By the grace of God, it appears they will survive. Senators are discovered to be on a [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4260.8s)]
*  hit list of an armed man on the run. Senator Lee's colleagues and the decision of the office of [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4265.84s)]
*  Mike Lee was not to publicly condemn the violence. It was to intimate that Melissa and Mark somehow [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4270.8s)]
*  deserve this by making jokes. Did you have any consideration for the survivors and her family, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4275.4400000000005s)]
*  for the Hoffmans and the hospital, for their families? You exploited the murder of a lifetime [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4280.240000000001s)]
*  public servant and her husband to post some sick burns about Democrats. Did you see this as an [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4284.160000000001s)]
*  opportunity to get likes and retweets? Have you absolutely no conscience, no decency? I pray to [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4289.6s)]
*  God that none of you ever go through anything like this. I pray that Senator Lee and your office [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4295.4400000000005s)]
*  begin to see people you work with in this building as colleagues and human beings, and I pray that [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4299.44s)]
*  if God forbid you ever find yourself having to deal with anything similar, you find yourselves [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  on the receiving end of the kind of grace and compassion that Senator Mike Lee could not muster. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4307.679999999999s)]
*  Lastly, I suggest you take a few minutes today to read about Melissa Hortman and her husband, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4312.08s)]
*  Mark. They were remarkable people. Here's a story in the St. Pioneer Press, St. Paul Pioneer Press, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4315.44s)]
*  called Melissa Hortman, once a teenager with a job making burritos, she became a powerful [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4321.28s)]
*  Minnesota lawmaker who trained service dogs. She was a force and a human being, and I beg of you [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4324.72s)]
*  to exercise some restraint on social media as we continue to grieve. Ed Shelby, office of Senator [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4329.6s)]
*  Tina Smith. I found that powerful, and it just speaks to this moment that we're in. Like we've [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4335.84s)]
*  said on the show before, there is right versus wrong. There are black and white issues out there. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4341.280000000001s)]
*  Not everything is. Some things can be debated. There's some things up, a lot of things up for [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4346.72s)]
*  discussion. When it comes to things like this, there's no debate here. Okay? And to see people [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4350.56s)]
*  continuing to, I'm talking right now still, if you posted the facts about this, about who this [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4355.92s)]
*  individual was, and by the way, I don't even like going immediately to, oh, he's a MAGA guy, he's a [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4361.360000000001s)]
*  right-wing guy, but unfortunately we have to because they're spreading these lies to try to smear people. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4365.52s)]
*  They're trying to smear the victim, so we have to do that, unfortunately. It's just where we are as a country. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4369.76s)]
*  But you know, Greta, I think with the No Kings protests, and I think we leave on this, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4374.24s)]
*  people saw America again across the world, right? Donald Trump wanted it to be about his dictator [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4380.400000000001s)]
*  parade for his birthday, and it wasn't. I mean, we mocked it. We laughed at it. Corporate news [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4388.72s)]
*  tried to rehabilitate him. Corporate news tried to post these stories, and they take these weird [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4395.04s)]
*  angles to make it look like it was largely attended when it was absolutely not. That's why [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4400.32s)]
*  we showed it from every angle, and each angle was actually worse than the next. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4405.92s)]
*  Like, I think your point was the more videos that come out, the worse this thing actually was, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4410.08s)]
*  and the worse that it looked. So there was that, and then there was the split screen [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4416.16s)]
*  with what was happening in the streets. This is how Washington Post reported what went down in [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4420.5599999999995s)]
*  Trump's dictator parade. Planes roared over D.C. on Saturday. Tanks rolled along the National Mall. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4424.64s)]
*  Brass bands resounded, and thousands of soldiers marched past, cheering crowds, as the Army put on [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4431.76s)]
*  the largest show of military might in the Capitol in more than three decades. And it is a kind of [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4438.96s)]
*  bizarre photo that is very much like cropped in a specific way, with tanks rolling through [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4446.320000000001s)]
*  Washington, D.C. And then on the other side, you have someone wearing a January 6th hat, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4453.12s)]
*  dressed in all red, in front of, looks like, I'm not sure if it's either a helicopter or [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4459.599999999999s)]
*  missile system. It's hard to see because it's cut off, but military equipment. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4466.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what you're reporting on the Washington Post. I mean, if you went through the New York [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4470.48s)]
*  Times reporting, they buried the coverage as well, in like, about what happened with the No Kings. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4475.76s)]
*  Protest. You had to like, really like, look for it. But we focused on it here on the MidasTouch [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4483.28s)]
*  Network. We made it our top priority. It's reflected in the views as well, that people want to see the [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4488.32s)]
*  truth. They want to see what is actually happening and what is going on. And that's what we're going [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4494.0s)]
*  to report on each and every day here at the MidasTouch Network. And I think when I spoke to, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4499.28s)]
*  and I hear from our international audience, they go, thank you. We thought America was just totally [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4505.599999999999s)]
*  lost. But to see about 3% of the entire American population out on the streets protesting in big [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4512.24s)]
*  cities, small cities, big towns, small towns, red states, blue states, purple states, gave us hope. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4519.84s)]
*  Even though we're not going to be getting through this Trump regime, you know, anytime soon in the [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4527.679999999999s)]
*  next year to two or three years, we see light at the end of the tunnel that America may be able to [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4532.24s)]
*  make it past this. And I know America will be able to make it past this. I know with the heroic [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4538.4s)]
*  grassroots organizations responsible for the No Kings protests, who are responsible for all the [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uwvlMFO2k&t=4544.5599999999995s)]
