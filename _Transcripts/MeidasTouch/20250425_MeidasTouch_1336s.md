# DOGE Insider EXPOSES MUSK’S SECRETS…Before HE QUITS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw)
*  Well, it seems we need to audit Doge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=0.0s)]
*  It seems like Doge has been the least efficient thing with the government. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=3.2s)]
*  Elon Musk promised two trillion in cuts, and now he's saying maybe 150 billion. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=7.88s)]
*  But that all seems BS as well. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=14.0s)]
*  I think we need to investigate and look into what that Doge was doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=16.52s)]
*  Was it ever about efficiency? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=20.84s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=22.56s)]
*  Or was it about taking the data of people, getting access to people's private [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=23.92s)]
*  medical information or social security information and other sensitive data? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=29.48s)]
*  Is that what it's about? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=35.08s)]
*  And by the way, you don't even have to, you know, take what I'm saying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=36.4s)]
*  in terms of investigating or auditing Doge. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Let's talk about what one of Donald Trump's other top advisors, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=43.04s)]
*  Steve Bannon, called for this past week at a conference held by Semaphore. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=46.52s)]
*  He said it needs to be audited. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  What was Elon Musk actually doing? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Watch Steve Bannon say it. Play this clip. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  We need to have a very specific accounting of what he found as far as fraud goes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  and waste, and I mean details. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=63.12s)]
*  Treasury's got to sign off that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  OMB's got to sign off and every department head. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=67.44s)]
*  We need to know exactly what he found because he went from two trillion a year [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  to one trillion a year to 150 billion dollars next year with nothing this year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=73.44s)]
*  None of this makes sense. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=77.56s)]
*  The cuts you've seen that have been announced are programmatic, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=79.8s)]
*  whether it's USAID or DOE, that's a totally different thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=83.16s)]
*  So none of it makes sense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=89.8s)]
*  At least there, I agree with what Bannon's saying. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=90.92s)]
*  You know, remember when they were saying first, Elon Musk is the leader. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=93.56s)]
*  Then they were saying, no, Amy Gleason is the leader. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  It's like, like, who's Kaiser Sose? Right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  Usual suspects. Who's Amy Gleason? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=102.12s)]
*  Who's this Amy Gleason person leading this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=103.88s)]
*  So we want to dig into the facts here at the Midas Touch Network [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  about what is actually going on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=108.84s)]
*  So why don't we speak to a former career staffer at the US Digital Services, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=110.48s)]
*  someone by the name of Marisi Vinton. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=116.0s)]
*  Marisi, you worked at the US Digital Services starting in 2021. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=118.92s)]
*  You were a former adviser at the IRS in that capacity [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=124.64s)]
*  and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=127.64s)]
*  And what you did at the US Digital Service Department, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=129.76s)]
*  which became Doge with the stroke of the pen as Donald Trump signed that order [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  before it became Doge was actually government efficiency. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=138.0s)]
*  Let me just brag about you a little bit, because your background was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=142.68s)]
*  you're an entrepreneur. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=145.48s)]
*  As an entrepreneur, you had an exit of a successful business that you ran. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  And then you were thinking about what's the next chapter in my life? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=151.84s)]
*  The next chapter was I want to give back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=155.32s)]
*  I'm patriotic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  I want to help the United States with all of my business background [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  because I just exited a company. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  So you go into an area that was similar to your strengths, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=164.04s)]
*  US Digital Services, and you start leading some of these incredible programs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  You co-found the digital team at CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=172.92s)]
*  You lead the tax credit implementation at the US Digital Services. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=177.92s)]
*  One of the programs that we all know about that Trump's gutting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=183.04s)]
*  You led the IRS free direct tax filing system. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  You are creating efficiency. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=190.76s)]
*  Then Musk came into town. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=192.48s)]
*  So take it from there, Marisi. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=195.04s)]
*  Musk comes into town. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=197.4s)]
*  Trump signs the executive order. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=198.92s)]
*  You're on the inside. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=200.76s)]
*  You've since resigned. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=201.68s)]
*  You're like, I'm not I can't be here anymore. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=202.6s)]
*  But but but tell us what went down with the stroke of a pen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=205.0s)]
*  We had no idea that was coming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=209.24s)]
*  And so we found out the same time everyone else did that night. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=212.08s)]
*  So inauguration evening, we received invitations to meet with our new Doge colleagues. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=216.32s)]
*  Everyone we were told everyone was very excited to meet us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=222.08s)]
*  And the next day, all 162 USDS employees were brought in for 15 minute interviews. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=225.4s)]
*  With people who wouldn't who would only provide their first names and asked a series of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=231.88s)]
*  questions that felt like a loyalty test. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=237.52s)]
*  What do you think about Doge and who is your favorite USDS teammate? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=240.84s)]
*  Not not the most serious of questions, given how complex the work is in government. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=245.72s)]
*  And then it was it was rudderless. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  We didn't know what the interviews were about. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  We had we really had no context or leadership, which was both jarring because obviously Doge [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=258.12s)]
*  was up to something as we started to see the USAID takeover, the CFPB takeover. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=264.6s)]
*  But we had we couldn't even determine who was going to travel if we could get travel [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=271.48s)]
*  approval. And then on Valentine's Day, 42 of my teammates were fired Valentine's evening. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=276.52s)]
*  Well, most people are out to dinner or on holiday with their family. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=284.44s)]
*  And then that next week is when things started to turn around and Doge took a more active [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=288.32s)]
*  leadership in the USDS team. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  But we were we were also grateful that we weren't asked to be a part of the destruction. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=296.64s)]
*  That's not what brought us to government. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=300.72s)]
*  We didn't find that particularly efficient. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=302.68s)]
*  We we came into government to design great experiences for people to simplify people's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=304.68s)]
*  interactions with government, not to take down federal agencies. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=310.04s)]
*  Well, initially, when Doge was announced, it was supposed to be this thing outside of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=314.8s)]
*  government that was going to give advice to Congress. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=320.72s)]
*  It had nothing to do at all with the United States digital service. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=323.72s)]
*  And then, as you said, there was this mention of this merger to actually make it this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=328.04s)]
*  official thing. And it seems like they wanted to house it in the executive branch for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=333.16s)]
*  oversight or we should say, try to have a lack of oversight claims that Elon Musk was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=339.0s)]
*  trying to avoid. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=343.64s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're like, wait a minute, I'm I didn't sign up for this to be [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=345.8s)]
*  Doge. But you hang in there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=349.56s)]
*  You hang in there for a little bit. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=351.6s)]
*  You have you talk about this Valentine's Day massacre where all of your friends and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=353.32s)]
*  colleagues 40 40 plus get fired on Valentine's Day, you know, kind of out of nowhere. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=358.24s)]
*  Then take us through the next steps. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=364.52s)]
*  What happens as Doge really asserts itself and then really starts to impact critical [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=366.24s)]
*  government services, I think, especially at the IRS. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=372.32s)]
*  What starts to happen when they assert control? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  So I viewed what happened at the IRS as even though I was Doge, but as a bystander, I'd [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=379.08s)]
*  been on detail effectively the way that the U.S. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=386.12s)]
*  digital service used to work is you would be sent out to agencies. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  I was on detail on loan to IRS to support the direct file project. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=393.48s)]
*  And so when Doge arrived, you know, it was kind of a bizarre series of initial [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=399.08s)]
*  conversations. You know, you'd bring people in to to do a briefing, to do an introduction to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=404.76s)]
*  the agency. I'll never forget one of the first conversations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=409.96s)]
*  You know, we're kind of in this a bit of a brainstorming and one of the Doge people goes, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=415.32s)]
*  so everyone just imagine there are no laws. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=421.08s)]
*  And if you've ever met anybody at the IRS, the only thing that they're really passionate [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=424.52s)]
*  about is the law, taxes and tax law. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=430.24s)]
*  And it was just this giant experience of somebody who's like, you know, imagine there [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=434.24s)]
*  are no laws. Like typically you would say, wave a magic wand or, you know, blue sky [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=438.72s)]
*  thinking. And they just took a really different approach. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=444.48s)]
*  And and from there, it went like they did at several other agencies, which is you ask [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  for control and access over the personnel systems so you can fire people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=454.11999999999995s)]
*  You ask for access to the data, I'm guessing, to individuals data, I'm guessing to make [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=460.35999999999996s)]
*  determinations about benefits. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=466.52s)]
*  And then finally, you ask for access to procurement systems. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=468.96s)]
*  And that was so that you could cut contracts that you didn't feel it wasn't based on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=472.56s)]
*  logic, but that you didn't feel were effective. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=479.96s)]
*  And when you cut a procurement contract, that's often a as Stephen Bannon, Steve Bannon [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=484.04s)]
*  said, that's often a body of work. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=488.96s)]
*  That is stuff that is being delivered to taxpayers or services across government or, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=491.32s)]
*  you know, the IRS, it's making IRS, more functional, more features for people. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=498.04s)]
*  And so it wasn't really much of a rhyme or rhythm to how they approach their cuts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=503.6s)]
*  And it was not efficient at all. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=507.64s)]
*  So USDF, which you took a job for in twenty twenty one, which had nothing to do with [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=510.04s)]
*  getting rid of government programs, which was actually about digitization of an [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=515.76s)]
*  outdated federal government. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=520.72s)]
*  And you wanted to help. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=522.68s)]
*  You were doing things like building these systems, direct tax pay, tax credit [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=524.16s)]
*  implementation, focusing on things like that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  Must comes in. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=533.24s)]
*  They start doing loyalty tests. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=534.8s)]
*  They start firing people. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=536.72s)]
*  Then they start bringing people like you who don't want to dismantle and destroy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not what your skill set is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=544.24s)]
*  That's not why you're here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=545.64s)]
*  That's not why you're giving back. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=546.92s)]
*  But you start seeing what this group is doing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=548.44s)]
*  That's kind of did a hostile takeover of USDF and made it doge. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  So now you're almost a bystander observing what's taking place. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=556.04s)]
*  And now they're out there saying things like, whereas you would be working with IRS. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=560.68s)]
*  OK, let's do direct file. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  How do we get this more efficiently? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=568.0s)]
*  How do we reduce call times? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=569.48s)]
*  How do we make sure we're increasing our tax revenue? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=571.84s)]
*  Now, these doge people that must brings in are saying, imagine a world where there [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=575.04s)]
*  are no laws. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=580.16s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=581.64s)]
*  And these IRS people are sitting around there saying, huh, you know, what's what's [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=582.92s)]
*  what's going on? I got to ask you this question because I've always wanted to know [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  Amy Gleason, who you probably you know, I'm sure from there. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me show you what the White House has been saying about Amy Gleason. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  This is Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's press secretary. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=599.92s)]
*  This is from a few months ago after they were claiming in court, Doge was claiming [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=603.4s)]
*  in court that Musk was actually not leading Doge, but somebody else. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=608.72s)]
*  And they go, we all know it was Amy Gleason here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=613.4s)]
*  Let's watch this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=616.44s)]
*  So Amy Gleason has been the Doge administrator for quite some time, I believe [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  several weeks, maybe a month. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=624.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not actually sure of this specific timeline. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=626.24s)]
*  She's a career official. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=628.72s)]
*  She's doing her job as the administrator of this organization. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=630.52s)]
*  I know everybody's very interested in her name and who she is and what she does. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people who work for the federal government. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=638.24s)]
*  They're just trying to do their jobs and, you know, that's what she's doing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=640.72s)]
*  Doge Starr told us yesterday that they found out about her being the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=644.48s)]
*  administration administrator yesterday. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Why is that? You have to ask them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=651.08s)]
*  They're clearly unaware. I don't know. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=653.88s)]
*  Well, what's your response to that? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=656.88s)]
*  First, did you ever know Amy Gleason to be the leader of Doge? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=658.0s)]
*  I not until it was announced. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=663.24s)]
*  No. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=664.96s)]
*  So the first time you ever found out that she was either the leader of Doge [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=665.8s)]
*  or U.S. digital service, you and others working there, the first time you ever [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=669.64s)]
*  knew was it was announced by the White House in a court filing or somewhere. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  That's how you found out. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=679.24s)]
*  Oh, Gleason's the boss now. Right. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she was on vacation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=683.12s)]
*  It was it was a shock to all of us. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=685.24s)]
*  The prior week, it was clear that it was more involvement from Doge, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=688.0s)]
*  but nobody had a title. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=692.9599999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't clear to us that she was going to be our, you know, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=694.92s)]
*  the head of Doge or or the U.S. digital service. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  The way I view this and Amy's position is there's I've [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=702.4799999999999s)]
*  viewed as multiple doges, like different cells almost. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=706.56s)]
*  So there's the U.S. digital service doge, U.S. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  DS Doge. Then there's I don't know what to call them, like roaming doge. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=713.4s)]
*  So they sleep on the floor of GSA and they go to different agencies. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=718.16s)]
*  And ransack them. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=723.04s)]
*  And then there's also more doges is now officially inside the organization [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  and an official capacity. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=730.24s)]
*  So the Bureau of Fiscal Services, the gentleman there was Doge and is now, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=733.0s)]
*  I think, the assistant secretary's his title and he oversees a government agency. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=738.16s)]
*  And so there's different modes here that really kind of show that whatever [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=742.4s)]
*  whatever is the most effective approach is the approach that they'll take. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=747.28s)]
*  How worried should American citizens be right now about what Doge is doing [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  to the government, the impact that it's having, whether it's at the IRS, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=756.8s)]
*  which you have familiarity with, the CFPB, which you have familiarity with, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  or just in general, based on your experience. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm really worried that people don't understand that it's real. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=768.4s)]
*  I'm from Nebraska and I know I remember what it was like thinking DC is a bubble. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  But this is actually something that's happening in DC and is impacting [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  the country when I joined the IRS in 2022. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=780.88s)]
*  All IRS employees could talk about was how they only answered 12% of calls [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=784.68s)]
*  that year because they were under capacity. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=789.68s)]
*  And then there were huge paper backlogs. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=792.72s)]
*  Doge has cut that capacity. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=795.2s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=797.52s)]
*  We, I'm sorry, we went from 12% to 88% the next year, which is heroic. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what's going to, what next filing season is going to look like. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=802.56s)]
*  That's going to impact people across the country as they try to file their taxes. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=806.2s)]
*  They don't know when their tax refunds are going to come or their social [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=810.64s)]
*  security checks are going to come. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  So those are kind of like the next year worries. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=814.84s)]
*  I worry long-term about cancer research, medical research, those grants and that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=818.16s)]
*  funding of that research is what has made America great and is what has put us at [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=826.24s)]
*  the top of, you know, really thinking about medical research, education grants. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=831.16s)]
*  And it seems like a lot of that money, the long-term investments, which is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=835.64s)]
*  what government should be for, right? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=840.88s)]
*  Not the short-term gains, but the long-term gains, those are going to be, that's gone. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=843.08s)]
*  And so I also really worry what it's going to look like in a few years when [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=848.76s)]
*  we won't have had those breakthroughs. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  So you are on the inside. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=856.72s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk about Doge. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=858.44s)]
*  Is there anything that you think that's not being discussed enough that you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=861.28s)]
*  think about that you think deserves more attention? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=865.6s)]
*  I mean, it's rare for our viewers and we've got millions of subscribers here at [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=868.0s)]
*  the Midas Touch Network to actually hear from someone who was there before it was [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=871.96s)]
*  Doge, who was there during the takeover, who saw it, who has intricate knowledge [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=876.24s)]
*  of it and based on your knowledge of working with the IRS, the CFPB and you [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=881.12s)]
*  building these systems, you're in a very unique position to just share your [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=887.24s)]
*  wealth of knowledge with the audience. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  So I often like when I end these interviews, just to say, well, what, what [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=892.8s)]
*  do you want people to know? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  And there's no time limitation on, I genuinely want you to share your wealth [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=898.0s)]
*  of knowledge with our viewers about what you've experienced, what you want them [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=902.0s)]
*  to know, what people should be thinking about. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=906.0s)]
*  So let me toss it to you there. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=907.72s)]
*  I would say two things. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=911.88s)]
*  Number one, a lot of the destruction that has been happening across the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=913.4s)]
*  federal government is happened. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=917.6s)]
*  It seems like a constitutional crisis in the sense that you can try to eliminate [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=920.04s)]
*  or delete a federal agency overnight. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  And that is something that was set up by Congress and paid for by taxpayers. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=929.16s)]
*  And I don't understand how Doge has been able to do this legally. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  And I hope that this is something that there will be accountability for. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=938.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we should be demanding is accountability for the actions that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=942.04s)]
*  have happened and are continuing to happen. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=946.04s)]
*  I do think, and I really hope that we can rebuild from this. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=949.1600000000001s)]
*  And that is actually what gets, what gives me hope and optimism is that when [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=955.6s)]
*  we kind of take a step back and I'll be honest, the status quo was not helping [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=960.48s)]
*  most people, our institutions were not super responsive to today's problems. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=966.32s)]
*  And so there's an opportunity to rethink how we do this, but we have to do it the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=972.5200000000001s)]
*  right way and we have to do it in a way that actually puts people in their needs [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=976.96s)]
*  first and really understands the mission of government, the mission of what it is [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=980.6s)]
*  that people need and what government's trying to deliver. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=985.96s)]
*  And that's what I hope we can do in a few years if we're given a chance. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  If people like me that want to come back into government to rebuild are [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  given a chance to do that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1000.72s)]
*  I don't think this has been efficient. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1002.52s)]
*  I actually think it's going to be incredibly expensive to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1004.88s)]
*  rebuild what's been done. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1007.72s)]
*  I think that's very hopeful for our viewers and listeners to hear though, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1010.48s)]
*  that I'm sure you speak also with other workers, others who had been fired, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1014.32s)]
*  others who had resigned as you had resigned about what happens next. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1019.1600000000001s)]
*  Obviously this is a catastrophe and it's a mess, but perhaps the fact that we are [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  seeing it now, people understand the importance of actual efficiency, which [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1029.4s)]
*  is what you were doing when you reduced the ways the IRS was not responsive to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1034.64s)]
*  people to having an 85 to 90% responsive rate. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1041.2800000000002s)]
*  So there's a world where you and you think the others in a future situation, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1044.64s)]
*  future non-Musk, non-hostile government takeover situation are actually ready to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1051.2s)]
*  come back in the future and help rebuild. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1058.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1061.2s)]
*  Everyone is devastated by what's happening and wants to come back and they [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1062.08s)]
*  want to be a part of it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1069.12s)]
*  I think there are actually still great people inside that are trying to do the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1071.4s)]
*  right thing and I'm so happy that they're able to have an impact and try to push [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1074.64s)]
*  things in directions that are productive and constructive. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1079.56s)]
*  And so there is still pockets where it hasn't been impacted yet by doge's cuts. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1083.16s)]
*  And I'm grateful for that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1091.04s)]
*  And, but yeah, everyone, you know, a lot of my colleagues, former colleagues, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  we're really excited to hopefully get the opportunity to come back and frankly, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1098.24s)]
*  to rebuild people's trust that both, you know, fed employees who have been, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1102.2s)]
*  it's been a rough couple of months for them to say the least, as well as people, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1107.28s)]
*  the taxpayers who expect something, expect a good government, expect, you [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  know, things to be delivered, their social security checks to come on time. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  And so hopefully we can regain the trust and, you know, things like direct files. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  So doge cut direct file, the free tax filing product, and hopefully we can, we [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1123.44s)]
*  can reimagine that and bring it back. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1127.72s)]
*  You know, that's something that people loved and we need more projects like that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1129.52s)]
*  We can absolutely do that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1133.24s)]
*  You know, I, I, let me ask you more about that while I got you. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1135.68s)]
*  I'm enjoying this interview so much because of the wealth of knowledge that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1138.56s)]
*  you share, tell me about that though. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1141.16s)]
*  You built the free direct tax file system that was beloved in the nation. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1143.04s)]
*  People said, this is efficient musk. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1150.68s)]
*  Doge cut the free direct file system, one of the most popular things. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1154.2s)]
*  And you were one of the leads who created that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1162.4s)]
*  What do you want to tell American people about that program? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1163.76s)]
*  So direct file was a startup within government effectively. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1167.24s)]
*  It was a team of people who were passionate about new feature releases [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1171.84s)]
*  and taking it feedback from our users to make the product better in its first [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1177.32s)]
*  year, direct file, it was just a pilot year. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1183.16s)]
*  So it was very limited in the number of states. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1186.32s)]
*  It was 12 states that, that used direct file last year. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1188.28s)]
*  And in that first year, 86% of users said direct file helped [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  increase their trust in the IRS. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1198.24s)]
*  So we have proof that if you do a thing that people love, it actually helps them [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1200.92s)]
*  expect, have higher expectations and expect more from government and trust [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1206.6000000000001s)]
*  in their government to do that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1211.5600000000002s)]
*  So the other thing that, that we're very proud of is the direct file net [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1213.48s)]
*  promoter score is a private sector kind of consumer index of, of how people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1218.92s)]
*  love what they love the products that they use and how they rate them. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  And direct files last year was 74 plus 74 and this year it's plus 82, I believe. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1228.36s)]
*  Uh, apples is plus 72. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1235.28s)]
*  So that is how much people really loved a government product and a government [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1237.9599999999998s)]
*  service, uh, one more point, cause you gave me the chance to talk about it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  There's, um, you know, every tax season, there's a meme of like, why doesn't [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1248.1599999999999s)]
*  the IRS, you know, the IRS asks me to do the math and then they throw me in jail. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1252.04s)]
*  When I get it wrong, when they know all the answers and we started to pre-populate [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1256.68s)]
*  information that the IRS has about you into your tax return. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1262.04s)]
*  So that way it was more accurate and it took you way less time. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1266.64s)]
*  Uh, I got texts from people who were like, my kid did this in 10 minutes. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the average person, it takes them nine hours and costs them $160 to do [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1275.52s)]
*  their taxes and direct file is free and it took a bunch of people, 10 minutes to [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1280.72s)]
*  do it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1284.8s)]
*  So it's a really great example of government efficiency and something that [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1285.3999999999999s)]
*  users love and doge didn't see or have been seeing any value in it and ended up [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1290.52s)]
*  killing it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1297.12s)]
*  Uh, the AP reported they killed it last week. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ht7_RjSEuw&t=1297.76s)]
