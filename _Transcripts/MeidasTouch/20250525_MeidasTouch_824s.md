# Trump has DISASTER Day in Public MELTDOWNS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q)
*  All hell broke loose yesterday with Donald Trump's behavior, which began at West Point [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  where he gave a disastrous commencement speech that I covered in detail. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=6.16s)]
*  But here's what our editor-in-chief Ron Filikowski said about that disastrous speech. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=10.84s)]
*  West Point grads got rambling advice today on selecting a trophy wife after their second [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=16.32s)]
*  divorce from a draft Dodger in a red campaign hat before he hauled his ass off to play golf. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=22.72s)]
*  There was nothing normal about that speech as Donald Trump ranted that he thought stealth [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=32.2s)]
*  technology was bad. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=37.2s)]
*  He talked about second trophy wives. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=39.44s)]
*  He said that Qatar and the UAE said that the United States was so hot and that's what Donald [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=42.56s)]
*  Trump wanted to tell the West Point grads at the commencement speech. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=49.92s)]
*  He said that he needs to send the army to the US border. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=54.080000000000005s)]
*  He attacked transgender soldiers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=57.78s)]
*  He defamed former President Obama and former President Biden with respect to the former [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  Obama. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=65.8s)]
*  He said that he handed off to the Russians hypersonic technology. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=67.28s)]
*  As you were watching this, you saw that the army grads were forced to clap and they didn't [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=72.36s)]
*  know what to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=79.72s)]
*  They knew that the behavior by Donald Trump would get them court-martialed, would get [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=80.72s)]
*  them kicked out in a minute. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  They knew that was not leadership, but they were stuck there as Donald Trump wore his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=87.32s)]
*  red cap. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=91.44s)]
*  One thing I want to note though is how corporate news try to normalize that behavior and it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=92.64s)]
*  why growing the Midas Touch network I think is just so important. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=98.92s)]
*  So please make sure you subscribe right now and turn your notifications on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=103.02s)]
*  I want you to meet Jennifer Dooley. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=108.12s)]
*  She's a writer for Bloomberg. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=110.48s)]
*  Bloomberg, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=112.48s)]
*  Which, you know, I like some of their business reporting and I like their podcast reporting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=113.48s)]
*  at Bloomberg. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=118.48s)]
*  Here was her take. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=119.64s)]
*  This was her coverage. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=120.64s)]
*  Just so you see what's going down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  She goes, some of President Trump's advice to West Point grads today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=123.72s)]
*  Do what you love. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=128.72s)]
*  Think big. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=130.16s)]
*  Work hard and never give up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=131.16s)]
*  Don't lose your momentum. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=133.16s)]
*  Have the courage to take risks and do things differently. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=134.76s)]
*  Never lose your faith in America. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=137.96s)]
*  And by the way, I went and looked at her previous posts and sure enough, she's someone who likes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=140.08s)]
*  to repost the Trump propaganda, like literally reposting it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=146.66s)]
*  She reposts the Rapid Response 47 account where they have Kevin Hassett, the National [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=151.56s)]
*  Economic Council advisor for Donald Trump, who's lied about everything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=157.88s)]
*  When the rapid response goes wrong, not only did Director Hassett not say this, POTUS has [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=162.0s)]
*  been clear. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=167.72s)]
*  It all has to change, but especially with China! [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=168.72s)]
*  What do you mean, Jennifer, how Donald Trump completely caved and capitulated to China? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=173.08s)]
*  He put 145% tariffs on China around that date that you reposted the Rapid Response 47 accounts? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=178.02s)]
*  Then he withdrew the 145% tariffs and made him 30% tariffs, which are still crushing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=189.52s)]
*  American corporations? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=194.88s)]
*  So let me just show you what went down. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=197.12s)]
*  Let me come out with the receipts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=198.4s)]
*  I did a longer video on this, so I'm just going to show you a few videos right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  But take a look as just people in the crowd are forced to clap as Donald Trump says something [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=203.76s)]
*  about the armed forces should not be hosting drag shows. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=209.68s)]
*  I don't even know what the hell he's talking about. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=213.76s)]
*  And neither did the army grads. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=216.02s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=217.84s)]
*  The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows to transform foreign cultures, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=224.64s)]
*  but to spread democracy to everybody around the world at the point of a gun. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=233.92s)]
*  The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=240.32s)]
*  anytime and any place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=247.08s)]
*  Now one of my friends who is a veteran said the following. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump could have farted into the microphone at the West Point speech and it would have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=260.64s)]
*  have made more sense than the garbage he was spewing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=264.6s)]
*  He should be talking about the new path they are on and how there are brand new lieutenants [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=268.02000000000004s)]
*  in the class that will wear stars one day. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=272.64s)]
*  He talks about trophy wives and yachts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=275.84s)]
*  I thought it was important to give you that perspective from a veteran who shared that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=278.36s)]
*  with me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=283.48s)]
*  Here's when Donald Trump talks about the trophy wives. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=284.84s)]
*  So you can see, play this clip. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=287.24s)]
*  ...company and he had nothing to do. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=288.84s)]
*  He ended up getting a divorce, found a new wife. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=292.6s)]
*  Could you say a trophy wife? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=297.44s)]
*  I guess we can say a trophy wife. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=298.64s)]
*  It didn't work out too well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=301.08s)]
*  But it doesn't, and that doesn't work out too well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=303.24s)]
*  I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives doesn't work out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=305.16s)]
*  But it made him happy for a little while at least. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=309.12s)]
*  But he found a new wife. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  He sold his little boat and he got a big yacht. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=314.68s)]
*  He had one of the biggest yachts anywhere in the world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=316.6s)]
*  And here's where he talks about the quote stealth thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=323.72s)]
*  And I've approved a one trillion dollar investment and that will be again the largest ever. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=324.72s)]
*  In the history of our country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=335.4s)]
*  And we are buying you new airplanes, brand new beautiful planes, redesigned planes, brand [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  new planes, totally stealth planes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=345.44s)]
*  I hope they're stealth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=348.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=349.48s)]
*  That whole stealth thing, I'm sort of wondering. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=350.48s)]
*  You mean if we shape a wing this way they don't see it, but the other way they see it, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=351.96s)]
*  I'm not so sure. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=356.08s)]
*  But that's what they tell me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=357.56s)]
*  As Anna Bauer pointed out as well yesterday, spotted in Kansas City, Missouri is the Patriot [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=361.04s)]
*  Front, a white nationalist hate group holding its annual Memorial Day march in front of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=367.18s)]
*  the National World War I museum and memorial. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=372.8s)]
*  They wore masks, carried shields and flags. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=375.74s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, so for the past four years MAGA said that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=378.98s)]
*  the Patriot Front was an FBI false flag operation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=384.88s)]
*  So does that now mean that Cash Patel, who's the FBI director, and Dan Bongino are the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=389.6s)]
*  ones who actually sent these guys out? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=395.16s)]
*  All of this was going on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=399.36s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene picked a fight yesterday with Grok. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=401.04s)]
*  Grok. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk's AI for Twitter, now known as X. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=407.04s)]
*  She literally started yelling at Grok online. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=411.16s)]
*  She goes, at Grok. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  The judgment seat belongs to God, not you, a non-human AI platform. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=416.16s)]
*  Grok is left leaning and continues to spread fake news and propaganda. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=421.12s)]
*  When people give up their own discernment, stop seeking the truth, and depend on AI to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=425.04s)]
*  analyze information, they will be lost. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  She's spending her day attacking Grok. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=433.24s)]
*  Then Grok responds, Marjorie Taylor Greene identifies as a Christian, expressing faith [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=435.56s)]
*  in Jesus and traditional beliefs, like in her 2021 Christmas message. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  However, her Christian nationalism and support for conspiracy theories like QAnon sparked [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=443.32s)]
*  debate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  Critics, including religious leaders, argue her actions contradict Christian values of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  love and unity, citing her defense of January 6 and divisive rhetoric. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=452.48s)]
*  Supporters may see her stances as faith-driven. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=457.0s)]
*  Whether she's really a Christian is subjective, depending on personal and theological views. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=459.24s)]
*  Her faith appears genuine to her, but public actions create controversy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=463.6s)]
*  By the way, I used ground news to dig up that story as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=468.36s)]
*  That's the research tool that I use here on the Minus Touch Network to bring you a lot [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=473.44s)]
*  of my reporting. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=476.67999999999995s)]
*  There was only one right leaning source that actually talked about this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  The rest were left leaning sources or center sources. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=482.76s)]
*  Just funny that the right wing didn't want to touch that or cover that at all. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=486.88s)]
*  That's why I like ground news. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=491.52s)]
*  It lets you burst out of your own political bubble. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=492.52s)]
*  By the way, I think ground news is essential for the work that I do. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=494.35999999999996s)]

*  Let me just show you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=572.64s)]
*  You know, it's Donald Trump. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=573.64s)]
*  I reported on this yesterday attacks the company Apple. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=574.64s)]
*  He caused Apple to lose $80 billion of its market cap by attacking Apple and saying he [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=578.18s)]
*  wanted to put tariffs on Apple. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=583.6s)]
*  I mean, does he think that Apple is a country? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=586.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=589.16s)]
*  Anyway, Apple defies Trump and decides that it's still going to be expanding its manufacturing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=590.16s)]
*  in India. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=596.52s)]
*  Foxconn, one of the biggest, the biggest manufacturer for the Apple iPhones, is continuing its plan [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=597.52s)]
*  to go from 15% of iPhone manufacturing in the world to 25% with the new plan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=603.12s)]
*  At this point, Trump is viewed as such a clownish, pathetic, weak character. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=609.72s)]
*  No one even takes what he says seriously. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=615.76s)]
*  It's worse than the boy who cried wolf. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=617.72s)]
*  It's the felon sexual abuser fraud who cried MAGA. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=619.6s)]
*  The Philippines may cut their US Treasury holdings after Moody's downgraded the credit. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=625.28s)]
*  We're looking at it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=629.76s)]
*  The Philippines, one of the Philippines leaders said, we may not hold onto US Treasuries anymore [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=631.24s)]
*  based on the volatility of Donald Trump. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=638.46s)]
*  I think this is an interesting data point as well. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=641.34s)]
*  As Donald Trump unleashes hell in the United States, a record number of Americans applied [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=644.3s)]
*  for British citizenship in the first three months of this year and for the right to live [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=648.86s)]
*  and work in Britain indefinitely, according to official data. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=652.42s)]
*  You know, and people just see the way we're treating our own citizens here. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, take a look at this story right here of Leonardo Garcia Venejas, 25 years old. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=660.02s)]
*  He had a real ID, got the new real ID, citizen, social security, ICE, kidnapped him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=667.9s)]
*  He told Noticias Telemundo that authorities took his ID, his real ID from his wallet, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=677.14s)]
*  told him it was fake, handcuffed him and detained him in Foley, Alabama at the worksite. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=682.9399999999999s)]
*  A United States citizen. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=689.3s)]
*  And I've shared for you the stories of Jimena, the 19-year-old Georgia college student who [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=691.74s)]
*  was put in a detention center for weeks after she was stopped by ICE. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=697.94s)]
*  We've told you the stories about the Burmese national who was sent to South Sudan in violation [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=704.14s)]
*  of a court order. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=708.94s)]
*  You know the stories like Abrego Garcia and others, but you have the Trump regime just [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=710.22s)]
*  disappearing human beings in the United States of America. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=715.22s)]
*  So no wonder you see a 25% drop in European tourism and I think that's growing to be even [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=719.22s)]
*  more than that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=726.62s)]
*  Canada, I think it's 50 to 75% drop in tourism to the United States. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=727.74s)]
*  Australia, elsewhere, people aren't coming here because why would you want to deal with [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=734.0600000000001s)]
*  this crap? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=739.14s)]
*  Also, our airports are an absolute mess. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=740.14s)]
*  The flight delays because our transportation secretary's main qualifications for the job [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=743.1s)]
*  was that he was on the real world in the 90s in the real world road rules challenge and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=750.5s)]
*  he makes posts of himself talking about hashtag Latino wife making him Asada tacos. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=755.7s)]
*  That's what he spends his time doing. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=762.58s)]
*  While you have dog killer cosplay Kristi Noem not knowing what a writ of habeas corpus is [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=764.7s)]
*  and saying that the writ of habeas corpus is a way that a president can deport people [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=770.22s)]
*  without due process, literally the opposite of what habeas corpus is. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=776.22s)]
*  You've got RFK Jr. spreading anti-vax messaging over and over again. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=781.38s)]

*  in the future, literally preventing Americans from getting vaccines. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=794.28s)]
*  You've got the MAGA Republicans in Congress adding $5 to $6 trillion in debt. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=797.94s)]
*  Horrible stuff, but that's just another day in the Trump regime where all hell is breaking [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFHeZUud2Q&t=804.2600000000001s)]
