# Trump gets RUDE AWAKENING as MAGA CRASHES abroad
**MeidasTouch:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es)
*  Donald Trump is an international disgrace, an international embarrassment, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=0.0s)]
*  and we're seeing the Trump effect take place today in Australia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=5.84s)]
*  It is in effect there where Donald Trump has changed the dynamic of the election in Australia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=11.44s)]
*  The MAGA party there, or the MAGA party leader, a guy by the name of Peter Dutton, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=18.72s)]
*  Trump, they call him, in Australia was once leading in the polls. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  He's from the Liberal Party in Australia, which is, confusingly, their conservative party in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Australia. He was expected to become the prime minister there months ago, but as Donald Trump has [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=35.28s)]
*  attacked the entire world and has caused devastation to our ally, caused harm to our ally in Australia, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=41.92s)]
*  the polls change there. The current prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to go on to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=50.4s)]
*  keep a Labour, that's like their Liberal Party, even though it's the Labour party, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  they're more left party there, the Labour party majority in Australia, and no one expected that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  to happen if you were looking at the polls. Take a look here. This looks very similar to what we saw [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  in Canada. You see the blue right there is the Liberal block right there, and you see based on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=74.48s)]
*  the latest polymarket estimation, at least as of this recording, their odds of holding onto or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  getting a majority now at 4.5%, the Labour party, 95.5% chance there as voting is underway today, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  Saturday, May 3rd, record early voter turnout in Australia, and look, the people of Australia, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=100.48s)]
*  like the people of Canada by and large, hate, hate, hate Donald Trump. I mean, just take a look right [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=108.64s)]
*  here. They had big hands-off protests in Melbourne, Australia, a few weeks back. Just a reminder, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=116.64s)]
*  here's what was going on there. Now, here is their MAGA candidate, Peter Dutton in Australia. You [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=124.08s)]
*  could see him right here. He refers to the national broadcasters there as hate media, very similar to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  the way Donald Trump would call the media here, or calls the media fake media, an enemy of the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=151.6s)]
*  people. Dutton, Timu Trump, as they call him in Australia, the leader of the Liberal party there, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=156.64s)]
*  would always talk about, woke this, woke that. Here, let's play this clip right here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=163.2s)]
*  I'm looking at the YouGov polls right here. YouGov, as of this recording, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=167.36s)]
*  predicting a 97% chance that Labour will hold on to its majority. On the eve of the elections in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Australia, one of the things that was uncovered as well, although the Liberal party in Australia [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=191.28000000000003s)]
*  denies that this is taking place, but what can you say? I mean, this is what Chris LaCivita, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=196.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign manager, is on tape. He's on a Zoom saying it, apparently, that he was helping [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=202.48s)]
*  the Liberal party in Australia. So a Trump campaign manager said, you listen to it for yourself, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=208.72s)]
*  helping the Liberal party in Australia, the Duttons. So now Dutton has to be like, no, no, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=217.44s)]
*  no, we don't want anything to do with that. Here, watch this clip from 7News Australia. Great work, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=221.92s)]
*  7News, play this clip. Anthony Albanese campaigning at a school in Perth as Donald Trump appears to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=227.44s)]
*  make a last foray into the Australian election campaign. The Centre for Climate Reporting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  placing on its website undercover video of Chris LaCivita, Donald Trump's co-manager of campaigning [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  last year at his very successful presidential campaign. Chris LaCivita claims in this video [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=249.04s)]
*  that he's been assisting the Liberal party in campaign strategy with some of its structural [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=256.24s)]
*  issues. The claim made a couple of weeks ago suggests that the advice was coming as the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=262.24s)]
*  Australian federal election began. I was in Australia two weeks ago helping the Liberal party [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=268.56s)]
*  there on some of their structural issues that they were having with Peter Dutton. Now the Liberal [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=277.84s)]
*  party flatly denies it's engaged Chris LaCivita and says that he's had no contact with Peter Dutton. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's what Anthony Albanese says. The campaign of the Liberal party has become more and more right [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  under Peter Dutton. What to make of the Liberal party advice, who knows, but we can say this, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=303.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's spectre over the Australian election campaign has not helped the Liberal [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=309.04s)]
*  party one bit. It's been associated as being too close to him. In fact, before the election appeared [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=314.88s)]
*  to want to adopt some of his policies, that's been damaging for them almost certainly and this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=321.28s)]
*  reminder of Donald Trump two days out from the final voting day is likely to please Labour and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=328.8s)]
*  not please the coalition at all. You know, maybe you started your business because it was your [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=335.68s)]
*  passion, but then somehow you found yourself deep in spreadsheets, payroll forms and onboarding [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=339.92s)]
*  emails. Sound familiar? That's exactly how we felt running this podcast and the Midas Touch Network. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  Nobody's an expert in every area, especially when it comes to HR. That's why we are so excited about [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=350.08000000000004s)]

*  Now, one of the things you'll notice as well in the debate that took place between the MAGA [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  candidate, T. Mu Trump, Peter Dutton and the current prime minister, Anthony Albanese of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=416.48s)]
*  Labour Party. In Albanese's kind of closing remarks of the debate, he was asked a question about, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  what do you think is some of the biggest threats? What do you worry about the most? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=431.04s)]
*  And one of the things he said is that, take a look at Dutton. This guy spreads lies about climate [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=434.88s)]
*  change. And then one of the things that Anthony Albanese also says is, we have to focus a lot in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=440.0s)]
*  Australia on our regional partners. And notice what he says here about China too, that we have [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=447.04s)]
*  a good trading relationship with China, a good trading relationship with other Southeast Asian [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=453.2s)]
*  nations. And notice that he mentions that a lot as being a priority. And he's like, you know, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=458.88s)]
*  Albanese saying, what climate change is woke and all of these, we don't need that in Australia. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=465.12s)]
*  He goes, because our trading partners in our region also recognize that climate change is real [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=470.24s)]
*  and it's a threat. Enough of this MAGA stuff. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=477.28s)]
*  I want to take a risk. Peter spoke about his long experience and that's true, but that's the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=488.88s)]
*  problem. Every Pacific leader remembers him joking about water lapping at their doors. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=494.24s)]
*  For the Pacific Island neighbours, it's not a joke, climate change. It's something that is the entry [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=501.04s)]
*  fee to credibility in our region. With our ASEAN neighbours, I brought every ASEAN leader down to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=507.04s)]
*  Australia last March. Every leader came here and we've developed constructive relationships. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=514.08s)]
*  We've managed to build our relationship with Japan and Korea, including our defence relationships, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=520.48s)]
*  at the same time as we've restored more normal relations with China, bringing back $20 billion [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=526.4000000000001s)]
*  of trade that was stopped with the impediments that were put in place. There were not even a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  phone call between any Australian government minister and our major trading partner during [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=539.92s)]
*  the last term of parliament. That's it. Thank you kindly. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=545.12s)]
*  No, again, it reminds me as well, you had Mark Carney. Since he's become Prime Minister, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  no one expected in Canada, the Liberal Party in Canada, to go on to even hold a Liberal [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  minority government there. No one thought that was, everyone thought Pierre Poliev in the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=564.08s)]
*  Conservative Party was going to go on and win, but the Trump effect in Canada, the Trump effect [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=569.2s)]
*  in Australia, and you see how people are standing up to Trump. This is Prime Minister Carney [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=575.44s)]
*  from yesterday talking about visiting the White House, but on his own terms, and that never will [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=583.28s)]
*  he ever be agreeable to the 51st date or anything like that. He's like, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  that's not happening period full stop here. Watch this clip of Prime Minister Carney. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  In your second call with the president, did Mr. Trump outright say or insinuate at any point that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=603.52s)]
*  Canada should become the 51st date? He did not. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  All right. We've heard Mr. Trump on April 23rd and his surrogates throughout the final days [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=611.6s)]
*  of the campaign reiterate the idea that they believe Canada should become the 51st date on [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=617.2s)]
*  the campaign trail. You said on multiple occasions that respect for Canada would be one of the key [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=621.04s)]
*  things in terms of having a meeting with him. Do you think over the past few days we have seen [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=625.76s)]
*  respect for Canada from the Trump administration? Look, I would, it's always important to distinguish [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=629.5999999999999s)]
*  want from reality. Right? What someone wants and what is reality and what the Canadian people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  clearly have stated virtually without exception is this will never ever happen. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=646.8s)]
*  Now, one of the things I think is notable too to think about is there should be a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=652.88s)]
*  easy trade deal to have with Australia. The United States does not have a trade deficit [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=660.56s)]
*  with Australia. There's an existing trade deal in place. Like the fact that Trump can't even do a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=667.6s)]
*  trade deal in Australia as of this point tells you what a bad deal maker Donald Trump is. It [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=673.44s)]
*  could be that they're just waiting for the elections because they know that Donald Trump [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=679.7600000000001s)]
*  is a major factor in the elections in a bad way. Here's Justin Wolfers, economics professor at [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=684.72s)]
*  University of Michigan. He's like, this was recorded on April 22nd where he thought, come on, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  that Donald's going to be able to at least announce some deal with Australia, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  Because there's no trade deficit with Australia. There's already an existing deal. You should be [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=702.08s)]
*  able to announce this, but Donald Trump has not been able to do so. You're playing this clip. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=706.96s)]
*  I do want to point one thing out. At some point in the next couple of weeks, they're going to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=710.96s)]
*  front the press and say, Hey, we got a new trade deal with blank. It'll be some country, pretty good [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  chance. It'll be Australia actually. And they're going to say, look at this amazing trade deal. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=720.0s)]
*  We got with Australia, no tariffs with Australia. The thing I want you viewers to understand is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=724.08s)]
*  we already had no tariffs with Australia. We had a free trade agreement. We had very close to no [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=729.52s)]
*  tariffs with Europe, with every other major trading partner, with very few exceptions. So [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  he's going to try it out and declare victory for giving us back the economy that we had in the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=741.36s)]
*  days before April 2. Oh, also going back to Canada for a second, the leader of the conservative party, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  their team, who Trump, their maple maga, Pierre Poliev lost his seat, lost his writing as they call [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=753.6s)]
*  it in Canada. And he bullied a member. Just this happened yesterday. He bullied someone who has a [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=761.28s)]
*  writing in Alberta where there was an 80% conservative vote for this other guy to forfeit [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=769.84s)]
*  his writing. So Pierre Poliev could stay in parliament, could stay in the House of Commons. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=777.8399999999999s)]
*  So Pierre Poliev took somebody's seat, which you can do in Canada, I mean, which is, you know, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=783.52s)]
*  fairly embarrassing, right there. Let me show you this one other clip of Peter Dutton saying, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=788.56s)]
*  woke this, woke that so you can see it. Let's play this clip. How are you defining woke? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=793.04s)]
*  Well, I answered that question yesterday. I think the point that I see that's of interest as well is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=797.92s)]
*  what we would do in relation to education funding and health funding. We are absolutely [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=804.0s)]
*  committed to health and education funding as the numbers appear in the budget papers. So before the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=808.16s)]
*  Prime Minister goes off trying to scare people again, and that's what he's doing at the moment [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=812.88s)]
*  because he's trying to pick fights, he's trying to scare people, but he's, you know, maybe good at [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=816.96s)]
*  that. I'll tell you what he's very bad at, that is helping families. But indoctrination was your [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=821.44s)]
*  word. What topics are indoctrination that's in the curriculum? Well, we've spoken before and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=827.52s)]
*  including yesterday in relation to it. I want young Australians who are going to school to get [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=832.56s)]
*  the best education they can. I don't want them indoctrinated according to the views of the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=836.4799999999999s)]
*  lecturer at university or in relation to the views of the particular teacher. I want our kids to be [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=840.4s)]
*  taught according to community beliefs and standards. And I think that is the expectation of families, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  not controversial here in the suburbs, might be at the ABC, but not controversial here in the suburbs. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=850.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're after. Last night, a woman asked you about getting the woke agenda [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=854.88s)]
*  out of schools and you spoke about potentially conditioning funding from schools to change their [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=859.68s)]
*  curriculum or to influence their curriculum. I think influence was the word that you used. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  Could I ask specifically what lessons or units you're concerned about having a woke agenda? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=869.12s)]
*  I want to make sure that our kids, whether they're at primary school or secondary school or indeed [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=873.92s)]
*  young Australians who are at universities, are receiving the education that their parents would [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  expect them to receive. And our position will reflect community standards in relation to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=882.4s)]
*  what is being taught at our schools and our universities. And you've seen some recent [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=886.88s)]
*  examples in relation to law school and the requirements being made. I think it was Macquarie [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=891.04s)]
*  University at the time. You've seen other academics who are out as part of protests on the streets [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=895.04s)]
*  and teachers simile. That's being translated into the classroom. That's not something I support. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=901.04s)]
*  I support young Australians being able to think freely, being able to assess what's before them, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=905.76s)]
*  and not being told and indoctrinated with something that is the agenda of others. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=911.2s)]
*  I think you see the dynamic. The Trump effect is the orange [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=915.52s)]
*  stain of failure that is Donald Trump, and no one wants to have a whiff of that grotesque odor [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  near them at this point. And so then we move on to the other elections. I mean, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=929.6s)]
*  that's why I said Canada was so big because Canada is showing the world [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=934.24s)]
*  the way you stand up to Trump. Trust me, in Japan, they're looking at the Canadian elections and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  going, whoa, whoa, whoa. That whole dynamic change. If Donald Trump disrespects and dishonors Japan [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  on a trade deal, the governing party is going to get thrown. That's how they're seeing this [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=952.6400000000001s)]
*  across the world right now in terms of standing up to Donald Trump. We've got a Romania election. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=957.2s)]
*  That's big. Wow. May 18th. Poland's election, May 18th. We've got Portugal coming up in May 18th. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikdebNN_es&t=963.6s)]
