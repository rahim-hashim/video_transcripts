# Fox GETS BROKEN on LIVE TV as Trump gets OUTPLAYED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0)
*  What a total and utter mess state regime media known as Fox was I think California governor Gavin Newsom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=0.0s)]
*  Literally broke Fox because the whole day yesterday you had like Fox [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=9.0s)]
*  Propagandists like Jesse water saying so what governor Newsom's calling Donald Trump a strong man [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=15.42s)]
*  Isn't that a compliment strong man? That's a good thing like being super strong watch what Fox [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=21.44s)]
*  Propagandists Jesse water says here play this clip. So he's calling him a strong man. I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  Think that's a compliment for Donald Trump. I hear strong man. The guys in a bunker like Biden with a pre-recorded video [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=32.04s)]
*  Oh, this is an attack on democracy. They're really gonna go with the dictator hoax [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=39.54s)]
*  They got more desperate than that and you had Jesse waters go, you know, you know what because of what Newsom said [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=45.2s)]
*  I think Trump should go harder [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=51.82s)]
*  He needs to break the break the back of these people break the back of these ice [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Resistance errs here play this clip [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=59.82s)]
*  Maybe the crazy base on the left thinks it's good because they love to see the country burn, but it's not good [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=61.28s)]
*  These are legal Jessica think they're living in Mexico. They're waving the Mexican flag. They don't like America [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=65.78s)]
*  They love living in LA because LA is great. It's nicer than Mexico and you get free housing free health care free food [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=72.56s)]
*  They don't even lay a finger on you. That's the problem here. They think they own the country [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=78.98s)]
*  They don't respect the laws and they don't respect the law enforcement [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=84.9s)]
*  I shouldn't think Trump should go harder [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=87.94s)]
*  He needs to break the back of this ice resistance and make sure everybody understands that this thing's not gonna slow down [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  You can't be held hostage in your own country by foreigners because that's what this is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  It's an extortion attempt every time you try to enforce the law. We're gonna burn stuff [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=99.98s)]
*  That's not how it works and then I love this where you have the only pro-democracy voice on Fox [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=104.46s)]
*  Jessica Tarlov on that show the five she does a great job [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=110.61999999999999s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Tarlov and she goes you do realize [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=113.89999999999999s)]

*  You saw the recent Quinnipiac poll which has Donald Trump at a negative 12 approval or a negative 11 approval on [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Total approval of Trump negative 12 negative 11 on immigration negative 16 on deportation [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=130.34s)]
*  Watch Tarlov put him in his place. Gavin Newsom is speaking for a majority of Americans right before we came on air [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  There was a new Quinnipiac poll that was released. So Donald Trump negative 12 on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=142.86s)]
*  Approval in general negative 11 on immigration and maybe negative 16 on deportations [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=147.86s)]
*  He has taken his best issue and decimated it by making these [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=152.9s)]
*  Deportations in a hasty way it used to be go after the criminals. That's what we heard was going to happen now [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=157.98s)]
*  It's go to the nail salons go to the job sites go to birthday parties go to immigration courts. There is now no [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=162.82s)]
*  Right way to do it. There is no way to be part of the system [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=170.66s)]
*  Pay your taxes make a better life for your family and hopefully get citizenship [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=174.14s)]
*  Stephen Miller is mad because they were deporting less people on a daily basis than Joe Biden was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=178.7s)]
*  So he went and he said go to 7-eleven and you go to Home Depot and now Americans and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=183.88s)]
*  Illegals who yes, they're here illegally are living in fear of what the government is trying to do and the just one more thing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=191.4s)]
*  the GOP caucus [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  like Valadao Gonzalez [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=200.84s)]
*  Representatives, they know that this is bad Valadao saying please prioritize removal known criminals Gonzalez focus on convicted criminals not farm laborers [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so then Jesse waters comes back and he's like I'm not a moron. I'm not stupid [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=211.76s)]
*  I'm not a moron play this clip. It just uses one of these little scissors. I'm very dexterous [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=217.2s)]
*  How do you know what a cuticle is? Brett asked me I asked you a cuticle is the part of the nail that meets the skin [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=222.2s)]
*  Okay, I'm not a moron Jessica despite what I sound like [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=228.66s)]
*  this is how you know [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=233.12s)]
*  California Governor Newsom and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  The majority of Americans the pro-democracy forces who have now [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=238.08s)]
*  Woken up how they're winning this debate. So then Jesse waters and then Fox they have to pivot. What are we gonna talk about? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=243.96s)]
*  What do we talk about Simone Biles? Let's talk about Simone Biles [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=250.4s)]
*  Apologizing to Riley Gaines this man stupid dispute that Fox has been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  manufacturing and talking about [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=261.12s)]
*  Simone Biles, that's what we talk about. Let's focus on Simone Biles [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=263.44s)]
*  Like there's about to be a major war in the Middle East Donald Trump has destroyed American economy [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=267.0s)]
*  But let's talk about Simone Biles here play this clip. First of all, is it ever a good idea to get in the middle of two women? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=272.7s)]
*  No, no, that's why I just want to lay back and hope she trains for LA if we start messing with her head [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=279.32s)]
*  She's mentally weak. Remember the one time she [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=286.04s)]
*  We have to make sure she medals, okay, so I'm gonna lay off her but I will say this she pulled a knee log. Oh [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=288.88s)]
*  I'm sorry for some of the things I said [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=296.55999999999995s)]
*  Come on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=298.52s)]
*  You remember the days when PR teams would have to like walk back something that you said that was based [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Now they walk back when you say stuff woke. I love it. We are so back right now [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=304.4s)]
*  This shows the power of Fox to this woman [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=310.0s)]
*  Riley Gates did the full kill me I think maybe six shows in 48 hours [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=313.88s)]
*  I just put so much pressure on Simone and by the way, that's what they were talking about a lot in the day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=318.68s)]
*  Like let's focus on Simone Biles. You know what? Let's bring on Riley Gaines [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=324.48s)]
*  They bring on freakin Riley. I don't even understand this dispute Riley Gaines pretends that she's like a champion athlete [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=330.24s)]
*  I think she came in like fifth place Simone Biles is a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=338.04s)]
*  Gold medalist over and over again and then they bring on Riley Gaines [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  like I guess this is the mentality of Fox to like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  Attack the gold medalists and support people who are not like first second [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  I guess or even third and then like you are an American hero Riley. You're an American hero [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  And American here and by the way, I don't even want to really learn about what this dispute is even about because [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  There are ICE agents who are going into factories and schools and courthouses and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=366.44s)]
*  restaurants and disappearing people [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  We have the Trump regime tariffing the world [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=375.96s)]
*  We have Donald Trump holding a military parade for himself [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=379.2s)]
*  So I I think there may be more important things than what Riley Gaines is whoever this even is is mad about [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=382.32s)]
*  Okay, sure play this clip just wanted to say you're a hero for young women women, right? Also for men. You're an American hero [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  That's right. And I'm glad to be on the couch with you. Well, thank you Charles. That's very sweet. Yeah, that's right [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=395.32s)]
*  and definitely I know we all grew up with the posters of athletes on our wall and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=399.92s)]
*  You'd be my athlete on the pressure check continued champion. But okay Riley tell us [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=404.12s)]
*  Tell it tell us how you really feel. I think a lot of people took issue with the fact people took issue [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=409.58s)]
*  There's real issues taking place. I don't think this is one of them play this clip [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=415.2s)]
*  What do you think the message is now that she has shaped for these young women that used to look up to her? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  I think the thing a lot of people took issue with is of course the body shaming portion of this where she's referring to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=426.12s)]
*  Me as someone with a male stature first of all, I'm five foot five. I wouldn't say that's overly tall for a woman [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=432.56s)]
*  Maybe compared to someone who's four foot eight that might seem like a giant but to most women that's that's relatively standard [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=440.04s)]
*  I'm about 130 135 pounds not overly big. Yes, I'm muscular [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that's part of being an athlete and if anyone would understand that you would imagine it would be Simone Biles because I'm telling [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=450.68s)]
*  you Fox wants to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=457.92s)]
*  distract and trap people to talk about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=459.56s)]
*  Like penises and vaginas like like, oh, are you trans? Are you straight? Are you gay? Are you do see that? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=463.36s)]
*  What are you even talking about like these Fox hosts they wait they wake up every day and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=469.88s)]
*  Y'all are weird if this is what you're thinking about every day just treat human beings like humans treat people with dignity [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=475.4s)]
*  Treat people the way you want to be treated and just stop with the bullying [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=482.96s)]

*  the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=569.94s)]
*  Trump's disastrous trade deals because we're what we're approaching the 90 deals in 90 days and he's done zero deals in 90 days [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=571.22s)]
*  And then they did this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=578.5s)]
*  Embarrassing [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=580.9s)]
*  Like not a deal. It's not an agreement. They call it a framework with China in London, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=582.26s)]
*  So back in May the United States caved to China and reduced tariffs from 145% [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=587.98s)]
*  To 30% then China reduced its tariffs from 125% to 10% and they called that a consensus [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=594.18s)]
*  So then they said they were going to agree to have talks [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=601.82s)]
*  So then they talked in London over the past few days and then they said we've agreed to a framework to implement the consensus [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=605.38s)]
*  a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=613.34s)]
*  framework to implement the consensus and then watch Ingram [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=614.42s)]
*  Talk to Howard Lutnick about what this is and he's like we ate chicken. We ordered fried chicken [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=618.4599999999999s)]
*  These are the most unserious [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=624.26s)]
*  excuse me, I don't mean to name call like pathetic and dumb and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  Disingenuous people here play this clip, but I want you to know for lunch for lunch [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=631.78s)]
*  We had British pizza and they ordered Kentucky Fried Chicken [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=636.5400000000001s)]
*  So mr. Secretary you after spending after spending this time with them you trust them you trust them I [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=641.78s)]
*  Think the way it works with the Chinese is you have to respect them [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  You have to respect them and it has to be a win-win [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=654.3000000000001s)]
*  But the answer is when you send us magnets will remove our countermeasures it balanced [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=657.38s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump said. That's what we're going to do. So I have confidence. This is gonna work. Otherwise, they just want a plastic [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=663.38s)]
*  Yeah, we would have magnets. They want to make they won't have planes. Yeah, I have an idea [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=670.46s)]
*  Why don't we make our own rare earth materials and that's gonna require an industrial [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=678.98s)]
*  So we can compete against China so they don't have anything over us and then I guess to her credit [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=684.34s)]
*  I don't want to give Laura Ingram credit for anything. She points out that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=689.22s)]
*  China [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=693.42s)]
*  Actually from whatever this framework is [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=694.66s)]
*  China outmaneuvered the United States because China basically said in six months [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=697.42s)]
*  We will have the right to stop sending you in the United States [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=703.86s)]
*  Rare earth minerals and magnets and things like that. That's why the United States trade representative and commerce secretary and Treasury Secretary [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=708.42s)]
*  rushed to China or rushed to cave again to China in London because [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=717.3s)]
*  American companies were about to run out of their rare earth minerals [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=722.5s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to build things so Ingram's like so why are you doing an expiration date in six months? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=725.6s)]
*  Doesn't that mean China can just dangle this over your head and then Howard Lutnick in his typical snake oil salesman way [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  It's like no, no, no, that's actually a good thing here playing this clip president announced [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=738.0999999999999s)]
*  Early this morning that the China deal is done [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=742.66s)]
*  He said and I just got back from London engaged in two days of negotiating with your counterparts [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=745.6199999999999s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal and others are reporting that while that framework is in place and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=752.6199999999999s)]
*  There's China supposed like going back to G about it, which seems a little odd but but but I understand the rare earth [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  Ease up on the export of rare earth materials that we desperately need because we don't produce them here [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=765.62s)]
*  That that has an expiration date. Mr. Secretary [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=771.58s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=775.7800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't it give them doesn't give them leverage over us [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=777.94s)]
*  You got to realize so what happened is they they cut their tariffs we cut our tariffs and then they started slow [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=782.5400000000001s)]
*  Rolling these magnets with these magnets are there a teeny little product that goes in every motor [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=788.7800000000001s)]
*  It's like part of the starter. It's a small business for us, but everybody needs it [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=793.74s)]
*  So when they started slow rolling us, what did we do? We don't we stopped delivering them ethane [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=797.98s)]
*  We give them all of their at the you know what that thing makes plastic [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=802.94s)]
*  So good luck running an economy without plastic. We stopped sending them plane parts and [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  250 of their planes were on the ground right because they need our plane parts, right Marco Rubio said I'm not taking your students anymore [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=812.0600000000001s)]
*  They can just go home and all these kind of moves basically [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=819.7s)]
*  Equaled the nonsense that they were doing to us. We got together the president and you know, President Trump and President [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=823.4200000000001s)]
*  She they got on the phone President Trump took a positive view. He said we're great friends. Come on [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=831.1s)]
*  Let's just put this negative stuff behind us and let's make the world a better place [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=837.46s)]
*  Then then Howard Lutnick tries to act like the fact that there's 55 percent tariffs [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=842.0600000000001s)]
*  From China into the United States, which is a 55 percent tax on Americans is a good thing [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=848.1s)]
*  The China tariffs are 10 percent meaning China is only taxing its people 10 percent [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=854.7s)]
*  why you taxing your people and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=859.82s)]
*  China has found export markets and Europe now in Australia and Canada and elsewhere and the United States has basically been cut out [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=861.98s)]
*  But let's see what Howard Lutnick has to say here play this clip [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=870.5s)]
*  So we said to him I said you want to stop fentanyl just stop it the way you did magnets [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=873.1s)]
*  You don't want to stop it. You can pay you 20% so they're staying at 30% [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=877.08s)]
*  Donald Trump in the first term put 25% on that's where they are, right? They charge us 10% [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=881.84s)]
*  So we're in an excellent place making huge amounts of money doing things correctly with China [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=887.84s)]
*  Reducing the trade deficit and now we're gonna get on to talking to them about doing more trade now bring on a Lori [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=893.96s)]
*  Chavez dreamer [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  And then she basically threatened she basically says that the president's gonna have talks with the Federal Reserve Chairman about [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=902.4399999999999s)]
*  Dropping interest rates. Okay, the president needs to stay the hell out of that stuff when he doesn't know what he's talking about play this clip [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  Are we not gonna see a drop in interest rates this year? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=916.56s)]
*  Well, the president has been again focused and how we'll have those conversations with the Fed [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  And the reserve the Department of Labor doesn't really weigh into that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=926.28s)]
*  But we'll usually when we see inflation go down, we're gonna see interest rates go down [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=930.16s)]
*  So I'm anxious to see the conversations that the president is going to continue to to weigh in on [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=933.68s)]
*  Because what we want to see is more affordability in our housing market [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=938.8s)]
*  And similarly you had Howard Lutnick kind of make the same threat to the chairman of the Federal Reserve play this clip [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=942.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable that you know, Jerome Powell is just sitting around waiting, you know, the president calls him too late [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=947.48s)]
*  You know, it's just too late Powell. I mean why why hasn't he cut? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=954.48s)]
*  I mean you remember if he cut interest rates 1% and got Europe cutting like crazy you realize that saves America [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=959.08s)]
*  300 billion dollars a year [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=966.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable how much we would save if he did his job and he cut interest rates. The economy is ready for it [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=968.96s)]
*  It's easy inflation is low. Come on [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGg2HYeBeb0&t=976.32s)]
