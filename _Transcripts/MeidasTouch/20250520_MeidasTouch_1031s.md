# PANICKED White House FACE-PLANTS in Presser BY LITTLE KIDS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns)
*  So Donald Trump's chief propagandist, White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, held a press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=0.0s)]
*  conference where she invited 10-year-olds to ask questions. And she actually crumbled under the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  questioning by the 10-year-olds who were serving up the biggest kind of softballs in the world. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=12.4s)]
*  Like a 10-year-old asked her, who is Donald Trump's favorite president besides himself? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=18.88s)]
*  And Caroline Levitt like froze and she couldn't really answer it. Play this clip. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=25.04s)]
*  Nora, go ahead. Which is Trump's favorite president besides himself? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=29.52s)]
*  Good question because it would be probably himself. No, I think that perhaps he would say [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=38.4s)]
*  George Washington. I know he speaks very highly of George Washington, who was of course the first [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=48.72s)]
*  president of our great country, and he has his big beautiful portrait hanging in the Oval Office [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=54.16s)]
*  above the fireplace. Good question. By the way, do you think that the only president who she knows [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  other than Donald Trump is George Washington? Do you think that's why she just says George [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=66.08s)]
*  Washington? I mean, remember earlier in the day when Kristi Noem, the dog-killing Homeland Security [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=72.16s)]
*  Secretary, was asked what is habeas corpus? And she didn't know and literally responded [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=77.28s)]
*  the exact opposite of what habeas corpus is and said that means that Donald Trump can send people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=84.0s)]
*  away without a hearing. And then Senator Kim asked Kristi Noem, where in the Constitution does [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=88.72s)]
*  it mention habeas corpus? And she's like, I don't know. Maybe you want to look into Article 1 under [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=95.6s)]
*  the powers of Congress. I bet you these 10-year-olds probably know that dog-killer, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=101.6s)]
*  Kristi Noem. The next question for propagandist Caroline Levitt was how many people has Donald [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump fired? To which Caroline Levitt of course lies. Again, she kind of glitches out when she [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=115.28s)]
*  gets asked this question. Here, play this clip. How many people has he fired? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  How many people has he fired? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=129.52s)]
*  Thus far actually, we have not had anyone fired with the exception of one individual who did leave [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=136.8s)]
*  their job. But we have a great team here so far. So good. Thank you for the question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=144.24s)]
*  Why don't you tell the kids about all of the veterans that he fired? Why don't you tell the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  kids about all of the park rangers and government workers performing essential functions that Donald [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=156.4s)]
*  Trump fired? Why don't you tell the kids about how you fired all of these people who work at FEMA [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=162.56s)]
*  who are unable to respond to disasters now? Why don't you actually talk about how there was a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=168.32s)]
*  hostile government takeover where you not just fired people but defamed them and said it was for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=173.76s)]
*  performance-related reasons when it was not. And now you've deprived Americans of essential [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=180.24s)]
*  services that are absolutely needed. The next question from one of the 10-year-old kids is, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=186.0s)]
*  what is Donald Trump going to do about climate change now? Caroline Levitt, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=191.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's top propagandist, did not like this climate change question. Play this clip. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=196.08s)]
*  What is Donald Trump going to do about climate change? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=202.4s)]
*  What is Donald Trump going to do about climate change? Well, that is a very good question. The [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=205.12s)]
*  president cares very much about our environment. He says all the time he wants to have the cleanest [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=210.72s)]
*  air, the cleanest water, the cleanest environment for the world. He also cares very much about our [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=216.24s)]
*  energy independence and ensuring that we can keep the lights on in our homes at a very cheap rate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  So we want to make energy here in the United States because we do it cleaner and better than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=227.6s)]
*  everyone. So I think that's how the president would answer that. That's how you answer the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=232.4s)]
*  question to little kids. He also cares much about energy independence. You know, under former [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=236.0s)]
*  President Biden, we were actually energy independent for the first time and we cared about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=242.4s)]
*  climate change. Why don't you be honest with the kids? Why don't you tell them? Are you too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=247.68s)]
*  cowardly, Caroline Levitt? Look the kids in the face and tell them the truth, that Donald Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=252.08s)]
*  does not believe climate change is real. Tell them your view. Tell them that you believe climate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=257.04s)]
*  change is a scam and that you and Trump and the regime have systematically dismantled America's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=262.64s)]
*  efforts to address climate change. Why don't you tell the kids that you are destroying their future [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=270.0s)]
*  and subordinating their future livelihoods and health because Donald Trump and you are frauds, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=276.72s)]
*  grifters, felons. Why, why, why? He's a felon. You're just a fraud. Okay, next up. The next [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=285.76s)]
*  question is what is Trump's favorite room in the White House? Here, play this clip. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=293.92s)]
*  Go ahead, honey. What is Trump's favorite room in the White House? Favorite room in the White House? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=298.48s)]
*  I think his favorite room in the White House is definitely the Oval Office because it's so beautiful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=307.12s)]
*  and he has decked it out in gold. It's now MAGA gold in there. Yes. I'm sure that really resonates [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=312.72s)]
*  with the kids that he what spray painted things gold so he can make it feel like a royal palace. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=320.48s)]
*  That's why he likes the Oval Office because it's all gold. I mean, I'm getting not just secondhand [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=327.36s)]
*  embarrassment, but like this is humiliating for our country. One, what the heck is even going on? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Why are you have 10 year olds asking you questions and your response is because of all of the gold? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=342.48s)]
*  That's your response. Then the next question is what is Trump's religion? Here, play this clip. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=347.92s)]
*  Remember your question? Yeah. Okay, let's hear it. What's the president's religion? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=353.76s)]
*  What's the president's religion? The president is a Christian and he believes in Jesus. Yes, in the back. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=358.0s)]
*  Why don't you actually tell the kids that Donald Trump doesn't really have, you know, any knowledge [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  about Jesus or doesn't have any knowledge and but pretends to do it and that he uses it as a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=373.36s)]
*  subterfuge to manipulate people? Why don't you tell him the truth right there? Now, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=379.6s)]
*  why was Caroline Levitt doing a press conference with 10 year olds? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=386.48s)]
*  Because they don't want to answer the questions. They don't want to answer the questions like [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=392.72s)]
*  they're trying to push through this budget bill that's going to add trillions of dollars to the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  deficit. They don't want to talk about that. Look, Donald Trump came to Capitol Hill earlier in the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=401.12s)]
*  day where he cursed out MAGA Republican Congress members like Thomas Massey and also cursed out [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=405.84s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress members like Mike Lawler from New York because they're not supportive of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=413.44s)]
*  the budget for different reasons. But here, Thomas Massey is being asked while you have Caroline [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  Levitt speaking to 10 year olds and not doing a good job. You have Thomas Massey right here [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  talking about how, let me be, he goes, I'm a Republican. Okay, let me be very clear. This [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=432.72s)]
*  bill is going to add 20 trillion dollars to the deficit. This is a disaster. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  People in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add 20 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=462.72s)]
*  trillion dollars to debt over the next 10 years, which is three and a half to five trillion dollars [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=467.44000000000005s)]
*  more than would have been. And Trump was pretty blunt inside the room when it came to the issue [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=471.68s)]
*  of Medicaid. Wolf. In fact, we are told from multiple sources, two sources inside the room [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=487.76s)]
*  that Trump said, quote, don't f around with Medicaid. And he used the curse word, not f around, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=492.8s)]
*  but that was the message to his colleagues. The question is going to be whether those Republicans [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  will ultimately fall in line because we know that that Mike Johnson can only afford to lose [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=504.24s)]
*  three Republican votes on a straight party line vote. He's trying to get this out of the house [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  by Thursday, but there is so much opposition concern within the ranks. Can he get those [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=514.96s)]
*  members to fall in line? That's going to be a big question as members walk out of this room. And [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  a matter of moments, we'll ask them if Trump changed any of their lines. Anywhere worth going [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  is worth going in good boots. Find your perfect pair with to Kova's ever wondered if you can pull [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=527.84s)]

*  boot print to Kova's crafts, quality Western boots for everyone from generational ranchers [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=549.2s)]

*  And I'll admit it. I was a little skeptical at first, but these to Kova's are something special. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=581.6800000000001s)]

*  Maga Republican Congress member, Mike Lawler saying the same thing. Let's play the clip. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=617.52s)]
*  Uh, this morning, let me let New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler make his own stance known [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=623.04s)]
*  as he did right after that meeting. Watch. I made very clear, uh, when I ran for office [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=630.16s)]
*  back in 22, uh, that I would never support a tax bill that does not adequately lift the cap on salt [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=638.32s)]
*  as it stands right now. I do not support the bill, but the president understands obviously how [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=645.36s)]
*  important these issues are. Uh, obviously it's imperative that we get a deal done and get a bill [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=650.24s)]
*  passed. And so I'm going to continue to negotiate in good faith, a large. And then to rewind here [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=656.64s)]
*  for you, this was the press conference that, uh, Caroline Levitt held yesterday where she said [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=662.88s)]
*  that it's not going to add anything to the deficit that we're going to get so rich play this clip. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=670.16s)]
*  Just a quick follow up. Um, is the president okay with this bill adding to the deficit? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=674.8s)]
*  This bill does not add to the deficit. In fact, uh, according to the council of economic advisors, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=680.8s)]
*  this bill will save $1.6 trillion and the president absolutely understands. And here's the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=686.0s)]
*  concerns of fiscal conservatives and of Americans who want to get our fiscal house in order. That's [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=693.04s)]
*  what the intention of this bill is. There's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill. That's the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=698.24s)]
*  largest savings for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=703.6s)]
*  The next bill that even comes close was $800 billion. That's less than half of the savings [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=710.0s)]
*  that we see in the one big, beautiful bill. And so, uh, the, the goal of this bill is to produce [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=714.48s)]
*  economic growth, to cut taxes and to get our fiscal house in order. And this is the right step [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  in the right direction towards doing that. No, when you're speaking to these kids, Caroline [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=725.12s)]
*  Leavitt, why don't you explain that this is all built on fraud? So one of the reasons why you claim [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=729.36s)]
*  that there's not going to be anything added to the budget deficit is that Donald Trump is lying and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=735.2s)]
*  claiming that he got somewhere between $5 to $7 trillion in his Middle East trip. $5 to $7 trillion [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=740.08s)]
*  from countries whose entire annual GDP is not a trillion dollars. Cutter's annual GDP is $200 [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=747.6s)]
*  billion. Okay. So you're not getting more money than the amount, than what the countries are worth. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=754.4s)]
*  Here's, here's what Donald Trump had to say about getting $5 to $7 trillion. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  And, uh, we have other things that say this. They are very, very, uh, they are very cash rich, to put it mildly. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=784.4s)]
*  And, uh, they're spending $5.1 trillion, probably is going to be $7 trillion by the time we sell. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  And, uh, you know, somebody said every other president goes and leaves and spends money, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=797.76s)]
*  gives other countries money. I'm the only one that goes and takes money back. You know, when you think [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  of it, I said, that's an interesting statement. I never thought of it that way, but, uh, we have, uh, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=807.04s)]
*  this is really just a pep talk. We have a very unified house and we have a very unified Senate. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=812.88s)]
*  By the way, earlier today, Donald Trump was not even aware of what negotiations were taking place. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=819.6s)]
*  He was asked a very basic question, which is, don't you want these negotiations to be over? Because [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=824.88s)]
*  a lot of Republicans have not agreed to this budget bill. And Trump's like, what negotiations? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=830.96s)]
*  What, what are we talking about? And then he starts attacking blue states and starts saying how he [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=836.0s)]
*  doesn't want to include money in the budget for blue states here. Play this clip. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=840.96s)]
*  I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=870.96s)]
*  the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=872.96s)]
*  talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=874.96s)]
*  I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=876.96s)]
*  the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=878.96s)]
*  talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=880.96s)]
*  I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about the Democrats. I'm going to talk about [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=882.96s)]

*  Now as someone who lives in a blue state like California, someone who grew up in a blue state like New York, I just want to be very clear. These blue states are what's called donor states. The red states buy and lose. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=886.96s)]
*  I just want to be very clear. These blue states are what's called donor states. The red states by and large are taker states, meaning they're failed states without the blue states. The blue states literally subsidize failed red states. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=908.96s)]
*  They're failed because they have MAGA policies which go drive you into bankruptcy. So I understand why a MAGA Republican congress member, even from a state like New York, if you're representing your constituents like a Mike Lawler, says to the red states, why are you capping state and local tax deductions at $10,000? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=928.96s)]
*  Why are red states either raise it significantly or remove the cap in general? Why are red states screwing over the blue states that are funding your red states? So that's what's going on here. That's one of the issues. You have the SALT caucus, these MAGA Republicans in the House who are saying that they can't support this budget bill because of the SALT cap. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=951.96s)]
*  And you have others who are saying that it's a problem that it's cutting so much Medicaid. So that's the fight right now. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim877V5hns&t=974.96s)]
