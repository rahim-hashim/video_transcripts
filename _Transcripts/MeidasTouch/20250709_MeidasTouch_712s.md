# Trump has DEVASTATING DAY as his term BLOWS UP in HIS FACE
**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM)
*  Ukraine isn't messing around, although Donald Trump is messing around. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=0.0s)]
*  What you saw right there was an explosion at a Russian Grad unguided rocket MLRS in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=14.52s)]
*  the occupied Donetsk region. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=21.6s)]
*  Ukraine is striking inside those regions and deep inside Russia as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=24.68s)]
*  What is the Trump regime doing? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=29.26s)]
*  They were withholding key Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, only for Donald Trump [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  to then claim that he didn't know his own regime was withholding it from Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=38.74s)]
*  And then the Trump regime blamed Pete Hegseth, the former Weekend Fox host, and said that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=45.1s)]
*  Hegseth did it on his own without consulting anybody. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=50.58s)]
*  It was even worse than that because at the disastrous press conference that Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=54.54s)]
*  held yesterday when he was asked by Caitlin Collins of CNN, hey, who ordered that those [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=59.58s)]
*  Patriot missiles and other weapons stop going to Ukraine? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=65.86s)]
*  Who ordered it, Donald? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=69.66s)]
*  Donald Trump goes, I don't know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=70.94s)]
*  Why are you asking me? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=73.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=74.1s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=75.1s)]
*  So who ordered the pause last week? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=76.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=77.1s)]
*  What did you tell me? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=78.1s)]
*  I think that's a question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=79.1s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=80.1s)]
*  What the hell kind of answer is that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=81.1s)]
*  And here's the story from CNN. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=83.58s)]
*  Hegseth did not inform the White House before he authorized a pause on weapons shipments [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=85.34s)]
*  to Ukraine, sources say. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=90.5s)]
*  So let me just get this straight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=92.1s)]
*  Here's someone who is putting his war plans on signal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=93.94s)]
*  This is the second time, if you take Trump's own admission, that Hegseth has withheld weapons [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=99.3s)]
*  without Trump knowing about it, yet this guy remains the Secretary of Defense? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=105.46s)]
*  No. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=110.34s)]
*  The attack stops with Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=111.34s)]
*  And in this cacostocracy, this despicable and incompetent regime, this substitutes for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=112.9s)]
*  the norm and never normalize. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  And speaking about what we should never normalize, OCCRP got the following exclusive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=121.22s)]
*  Top Trump advisor, Sergio Gore. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  His name ain't Sergio Gore. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=130.86s)]
*  He was actually born inside the Soviet Union, the birthplace of Trump's director of personnel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=133.26s)]
*  one of the top positions in the White House, has been the subject of media speculation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=139.88s)]
*  until now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=144.84s)]
*  He's been called by many in D.C. the most powerful man you've never heard of. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=146.44s)]
*  Okay, where is he from? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=151.96s)]
*  The Times of Malta and OCCRP have obtained a notarized Maltese property record that shows [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Gore's origins. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=160.24s)]
*  He was born Sergio Gorchevsky on November 30th, 1986, in Uzbekistan, part of the Soviet [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=161.4s)]
*  Union. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=169.12s)]
*  Okay, and why isn't he submitting to the normal background check that most other people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=170.12s)]
*  submit to? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=176.44s)]
*  You would expect that to happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  But what else would you expect in the Trump regime? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Have you seen this one, folks? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=182.88s)]
*  The Pam Bondi inaction figure? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=184.3s)]
*  Here she is right there with the Epstein files on her desk and she goes, it's on my desk. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=187.22s)]
*  I'm going to release it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=192.38s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=193.62s)]
*  The Epstein files don't exist anymore. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=194.62s)]
*  I don't know where that where that went. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=196.62s)]
*  Did you see, by the way, what they tried to do to distract from the fact that they claim [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=198.94s)]
*  the Epstein files don't exist anymore? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=203.84s)]
*  How just duplicitous was this move? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=207.26s)]
*  So after they said no such thing as the Epstein files and then they released that video footage [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=210.74s)]
*  that was missing a minute of the critical one of the critical minutes just went missing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=215.14s)]
*  on this video. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=220.64s)]
*  Well, then the FBI launched a criminal investigation of former CIA Director John Brennan and James [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=221.64s)]
*  Comey, according to DOJ sources. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=228.8s)]
*  Ooh, I guess we're supposed to be distracted from that when you all promised you were going [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=231.16s)]
*  to release the Epstein files and now you're hiding it because Donald Trump is most likely [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=235.56s)]
*  all over the files and he's all over the files that have already been released. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=240.6s)]
*  By the way, folks, a Trump appointed judge, Judge Gallagher in Maryland was not putting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=246.72s)]
*  up with any of Donald Trump's S.H.I. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=254.38s)]
*  You know what I'm about to say. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=257.78s)]
*  So Judge Gallagher was appointed by Trump in 2019 and she on her own took judicial notice [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=260.24s)]
*  of the conditions in CICOT, the concentration camp in El Salvador, where human torture takes [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=267.8s)]
*  place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  She says the United Nations did a report on human torture and now you, the Trump regime, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  are claiming that this is not a place where torture takes place. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  You have consistently provided false information to this court. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=284.6s)]
*  The court is absolutely livid and that is coming from a Trump appointed judge. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=289.74s)]
*  All the time from the Trump regime. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=296.4s)]
*  So as this one account says, I guess we're going to have to throw out all the government [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=299.36s)]
*  data between 2025 and 2028 because it's just a bunch of BS. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=303.32s)]
*  Remember how we told you how all the civil servants were basically being pushed out, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=309.2s)]
*  the experts, the qualified people, the veterans who were working in the various government [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  agencies quietly, just worksmen like doing their job, how Doge pushed all of them out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=318.28s)]
*  Well, I already flagged last week when the Trump regime claimed that 147,000 new jobs [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=324.44s)]
*  were added after the ADP private payroll data the day before said that 33,000 jobs were [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=331.68s)]
*  lost in the private sector. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  And so while Doge was cutting all of these government jobs, the Trump regime claims that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=341.72s)]
*  all of these new jobs were created in government sectors and a lot of new teaching jobs were [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=345.76s)]
*  created. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  That doesn't sound very logical to me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=353.08s)]
*  And of course, Trump picked the number 47, 147,000 47 president. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=355.28s)]
*  And again, like here's what the US Department of Labor published today. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=360.64s)]
*  Under Trump, native born workers have accounted for all job gains since January. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=364.88s)]
*  American workers first. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=372.08s)]
*  They're saying 100%. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  They're leaving no room for any other types of jobs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=375.58s)]
*  Only native born Americans accounted for all job gains. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=379.28s)]
*  Obviously, they're just making up stats and they're making up the dumbest, most obvious [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=382.68s)]
*  lies in everything that they are doing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=387.32s)]
*  But folks, we can question according to the regime and the regime sycophants, we can question [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=391.0s)]
*  what they're doing, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=398.56s)]
*  It's a loser mentality to try to say who's doing things wrong, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=400.2s)]
*  So you had Greg Abbott from governor of Texas. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  He was asked a lot of questions. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=409.56s)]
*  We're trying to figure out what the hell happened in Kirk County. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=411.16s)]
*  Why did over 100 people die, many of them young girls? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  Why were there six critical vacancies in Texas at the National Weather Service? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=420.04s)]
*  The key meteorologist coordinator forced out by Doge. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=425.8s)]
*  That would have been somewhat integrally involved in what went down. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  Why were local officials saying they did not get the warnings that they needed from the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=433.48s)]
*  feds? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=438.44000000000005s)]
*  Did we federalize a lot of these swift boats and other key emergency response vehicles? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=439.52s)]
*  I know you're making a whole performative scene out of it in California to terrorize [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=446.24s)]
*  the community. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=450.68s)]
*  Did you get into action at the right time when people knew this storm was coming in [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=451.92s)]
*  Texas? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=456.92s)]
*  We're allowed to ask those questions, but according to Greg Abbott of Texas, no, we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=458.24s)]
*  can't. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=464.4s)]
*  Only losers ask that question. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=465.4s)]
*  And Greg Abbott, this is what he goes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=466.96s)]
*  He goes, here in Texas, we like football in Texas. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=468.24s)]
*  We like football. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=472.0s)]
*  And in football, you don't blame people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=473.48s)]
*  In football, you just score touchdowns. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=476.24s)]
*  The hell are you talking about? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=478.24s)]
*  We want to understand why 100 people are dead, why they didn't get the warnings they needed [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=480.92s)]
*  at the right time. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=485.88s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  And this answer by him is unacceptable. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  You ask, I'm going to use your words. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  Who's to blame? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=494.36s)]
*  Know this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the word choice of losers. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  Let me explain one thing about Texas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=501.08s)]
*  And that is Texas, every square inch of our state, cares about football. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  You could be in Hunt, Texas, Huntsville, Texas, Houston, Texas, any size community that care [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  about football. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=515.04s)]
*  High school, Friday night lights, college football, or pro. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=516.04s)]
*  Know this. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=520.56s)]
*  Every football team makes mistakes. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=522.06s)]
*  The losing teams are the ones that try to point out who's to blame. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=524.92s)]
*  The championship teams are the ones that say, don't worry about it, man, we got this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we go score again, that we're going to win this game. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=533.56s)]
*  The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=537.4799999999999s)]
*  They talk about solutions. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  What Texas is all about is solutions. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=542.68s)]
*  And speaking about unacceptable, remember this moment yesterday during Donald Trump's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=544.88s)]
*  disastrous press conference where he says to the reporter, you're talking about Epstein. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=549.2800000000001s)]

*  I don't mind answering. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ2xnqmBVM&t=583.5600000000001s)]
