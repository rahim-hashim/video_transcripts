# Trump VERY CONFUSED in DISASTER Presser as More BAD NEWS STRIKES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s)
*  Donald Trump just gave a disastrous press conference in the White House that is sparking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=0.0s)]
*  more questions about his mental fitness and cognitive decline. Trump did not seem to be [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=3.92s)]
*  aware of much of what was going on in his administration. This, as the Federal Reserve, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=8.4s)]
*  was sounding the alarm about the collapsing economy. My name is Brett Mycelis with the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=12.96s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. Remember to subscribe and add the Midas Touch Podcast right now on Apple [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=17.44s)]
*  Podcasts and Spotify for more. This tweet from reporter Sam Stein summed up this press conference [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=21.36s)]
*  when Trump was asked a comment about Vance saying that Russia was asking for too much in negotiations, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=27.36s)]
*  Trump replied, when did he say that? It's possible he's right. On news that the Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=32.32s)]
*  administration is now going to deport migrants to Libya, Trump said, I don't know. You'll have to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=37.04s)]
*  ask Homeland Security. On Republican Senator Tom Tillis opposing Trump's nominee Ed Martin for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=42.08s)]
*  U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Trump replied, I didn't know that. As Max Burns wrote, quote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=47.04s)]
*  Either Trump's cognitive function is in sharp decline or his White House team is intentionally [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=53.44s)]
*  keeping him out of the loop on key national security issues. Or both. Any combination of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=58.48s)]
*  those things is a huge problem. Let's go through some of the lowlights here. Donald Trump rambled [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=64.08s)]
*  and complained that the U.S. doesn't get enough credit for World War II as he designated Thursday [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=69.36s)]
*  as Victory Day. Here's the clip. And it's, I really believe it's a shame. You know, it's, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=74.24s)]
*  I was watching for the last week and I noticed France, I noticed other countries [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=80.48s)]
*  all getting ready for Victory Day. And I said, that's sort of strange because David just added [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=86.8s)]
*  something. He said, we also rebuilt the world. And I didn't have that. And I should have that. That [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=92.64s)]
*  was a big factor. But I noticed all of the countries, Russia, having a big day tomorrow. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=98.64s)]
*  And by the way, they lost millions of people and they were absolutely a major factor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=106.72s)]
*  But there was no major factor like us. We won the war and we won it with the help of others. But [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=113.76s)]
*  everybody was celebrating, but the United States of America. And I said, you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=119.92s)]
*  I think it's time that we start celebrating victory. And that's what we're doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=124.48s)]
*  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, Trump said, we're actually going to have two Victory Days now, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=130.96s)]
*  one for World War I and one for World War II. But said that the American people get too much time [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=134.88s)]
*  off as it is. I don't even know. Watch this. All Americans should take pride in what these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=139.84s)]
*  incredible Patriots have achieved. So I just want to say happy Victory Day to all. So we are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  celebrating every year now. I can guarantee for four years, but I think after that, we're going [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=151.68s)]
*  to have two Victory Days, World War I and World War II. This is World War II Victory Day. In the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=157.2s)]
*  future, we're going to have a major celebration of each day. We're not going to have days off [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=164.56s)]
*  because we don't have enough days in the year. We have too many celebrations already. Trump was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=173.6s)]
*  also asked about his administration's plans to now send migrants to Libya. Trump said he [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=178.72s)]
*  didn't know anything about it. Watch this. Any other questions? Are you administration sending [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=183.36s)]
*  migrants to Libya? I don't know. You'll have to ask Homeland Security, please. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=189.12s)]
*  So three US officials have now confirmed to the press that the Trump administration is planning [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  on deporting migrants to Libya for the first time this week. Human rights groups have called [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=200.16s)]
*  Libya's detention centers, quote, horrific and deplorable. And the State Department has even [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  called these facilities harsh and life threatening. The State Department even has a travel warning for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=209.12s)]
*  Libya, warning of terrorism, kidnapping and armed conflict in the region. This is just yet another [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=214.08s)]
*  dehumanizing idea by the Trump administration and one that Trump is saying he just knows nothing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  about. Trump was then asked about his trade war, which is having devastating effects on the US [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  economy. Trump was asked if he would exempt products that families rely on from his tariffs, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=229.36s)]
*  and he said, like everything else, he didn't know. Watch this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=234.24s)]
*  Mr. President, the Treasury secretary just told lawmakers that a tariff exemption for certain [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=237.76s)]
*  baby items like car seats is under consideration. Will you exempt some products that families rely [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=243.2s)]
*  on? I don't know. I'll think about it. I don't know. I really don't. I want to, I want to make [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=248.16s)]
*  it nice and simple. I'm not looking to have so many exemptions that nobody knows what's doing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  We have to make it very simple, but I'll take a look at it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=256.8s)]
*  Trump continues to lie about China wanting to engage in trade conversations with the United [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=260.4s)]
*  States. In fact, China has said that the US has been trying to initiate talks with them. I mean, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=264.56s)]
*  the US is practically begging them to speak, not the other way around. Trump was asked about this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=269.44s)]
*  and he lied some more. Watch this. We will, but we haven't made that decision yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=274.48s)]
*  Mr. President, China said the US initiated the trade talks this week and that its position [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  hasn't changed. Are you still confident you can reach a deal with China? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=284.8s)]
*  They said we initiated. Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=288.88s)]
*  Okay. I do think that. Go ahead. Trump was then asked if he'd be willing to pull back on his [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=294.88s)]
*  massive tariffs to try to get China to negotiate. He said, no, watch this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Ordered at substantive negotiations, you have to bring down your 145% tariffs. Are you open [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=303.44s)]
*  to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table? No. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=308.96s)]
*  And I should note that literally just hours before this, Trump's treasury secretary, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=313.6s)]
*  Scott Besson said that the US would consider lowering the tariffs. Okay. I have to say, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=317.76s)]
*  hex clad completely changed the game in my kitchen. I used to constantly wrestle with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=322.72s)]
*  the choice between stainless steel for durability or nonstick for cleanup. And honestly, neither [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  ever felt quite right. But then I tried hex clad and now I get the best of both in one pan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  It's like magic, stainless steel performance and nonstick convenience. I've made everything [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=337.68s)]
*  from scrambled eggs to steaks in my hex clad pans and they still look brand new. They're easy to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  clean, totally dishwasher safe oven safe up to 500 degrees. And this is a big one scratch [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=348.96s)]
*  resistant, even when I use metal utensils, plus they're Japanese Damascus steel knives, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=354.4s)]
*  insanely sharp, effortless slicing. I use them every single day. And if Gordon Ramsey [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=359.52s)]
*  trusts hex clad in his kitchen, you know, it's legit. He's a tough critic, believe me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=364.88s)]
*  And by the way, hex clad products come with a lifetime warranty. So they literally last a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=369.28s)]

*  Bon appetit. Let's eat with hex clads, revolutionary cookware. By the way, here was [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=398.08s)]
*  a great moment from a hearing this morning where Democratic Congressman Meeks questioned [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=402.72s)]
*  Scott Besson directly about the Trump administration's entire basis for these tariffs, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  where they say that our trade deficits constitute a national emergency. Watch this epic moment. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=412.16s)]
*  Does trade deficits constitute a national emergency? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  The howling out of the U S main. No, just yes or no. Yes or no. Yes or no. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  National emergency, sir. It does. It does. Trade. You're telling me trade deficits [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  equals a national creates persistent and prolonged. Okay. And do you know also, sir, that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=438.0s)]
*  for the last four decades, we've had trade deficits in the United States of America [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=447.36s)]
*  and nobody said it was an emergency Democratic and Republican presidents. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what that says to me? That is not an emergency because it hasn't been for four decades. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=461.68s)]
*  It says to me that we should bring tariffs back to the United States Congress so that we can make [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=470.08s)]
*  that determination as the constitution has said, and not try to go around Congress. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=479.2s)]
*  That's just unbelievable to me. Let me. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has announced [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=486.64s)]
*  it is leaving interest rates unchanged, issuing a major warning about stagflation in the United [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=491.68s)]
*  States. That means slow economic growth, high unemployment and rising inflation. Here's Federal [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=497.2s)]
*  Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warning about stagflation. If Trump's tariffs remain, watch this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=515.44s)]
*  The effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one time shift in the price level. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariffs effect, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=531.44s)]
*  tariff effects on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  and ultimately on keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  Back to the press conference. Trump was also asked about the ongoing conflict between U.S. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=543.28s)]
*  troops and the Houthis. While Trump is now claiming there is a ceasefire with the rebel group, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=547.36s)]
*  there have been multiple incidents over the past couple weeks in the region. In fact, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=551.76s)]
*  just yesterday we learned about a U.S. fighter jet that plummeted into the Red Sea when trying [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=555.68s)]
*  to land on the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier. At least that's the story that we've [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=560.08s)]
*  been told. This was the second fighter jet the U.S. lost in the Red Sea in just over a week, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=564.64s)]
*  and the fourth major mishap in just months. These fighter jets are worth about $70 million [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=569.52s)]
*  apiece, but I guess this is what happens when you have a Fox News morning show host in charge. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=576.0s)]
*  Anyway, Trump said today that he honors the Houthis' commitment and commended them for [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=580.96s)]
*  their bravery. Watch this. Take a look. But, you know, we had really a very good, as you know, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=585.52s)]
*  we had a very good outcome with the Houthis, and we honor their word. I mean, they made [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=592.96s)]
*  a commitment and we dealt with other countries that were close to them and their surrogates, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=600.08s)]
*  and we honor all of their words. We'll see what happens, but I think, you know, I believe that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWpZrUbC1s&t=606.72s)]
