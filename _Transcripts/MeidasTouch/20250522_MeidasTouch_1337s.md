# Republicans CRUMBLE at LIVE HEARING as SCAM IS EXPOSED
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8)
*  Mr. Scott, I asked, don't you have a, I gave you an answer. You don't like it. It's over with. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=0.0s)]
*  You see, MAGA Republicans don't know how to debate. So when Democratic Congress member [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=7.84s)]
*  Neguse was asking very basic questions, like who the heck put in a provision into this bill [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=12.8s)]
*  that all of a sudden states that you no longer have to register silencers with the ATF as part [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=19.76s)]
*  of the budget bill, who put it in there? You saw the MAGA Republicans like, stop yelling at me, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=27.04s)]
*  stop yelling at me. Look, the Democrats were fighting all day and this is what I wanted to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=33.04s)]
*  see Democrats going gloves off. So I want to show you this interaction between Democratic [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=38.4s)]
*  Congress member Neguse, where he speaks to the MAGA Republican Congress member and says, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=43.76s)]
*  who the hell added a provision into a budget bill that not only provides tax exemptions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=49.92s)]
*  for silencers, but adds a provision that clearly states that people no longer have to even register [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  their silencers anymore. Something that has been around since the days of Al Capone, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=64.72s)]
*  that you have to register your silencers. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  The question I have is, this was not in the bill that we were marking up. So whose vote was bought [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=74.08s)]
*  with this provision that silencers will no longer need to be registered with the ATF or subject to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=83.44s)]
*  background checks, purchasers, that is to say. Like who was, what member was on the fence about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  this bill and then went to Republican leadership and said, I know you're eliminating the tax on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=98.48s)]
*  silencers, but if you can just eliminate all regulation of silencers, I will vote for this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=104.48s)]
*  bill. Who's? It did not eliminate all regulations of silencers. Sure. So subject. No, it doesn't. No, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=110.08s)]
*  no, no, no. You don't know anything about this one, brother. I haven't built it to you yet, Mr. Scott. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  I have 10 of them. I haven't built it to you yet. I have 10 plus. I haven't built it to you yet, Mr. Scott. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  So I'll. Mr. Negus has the time. Thank you, Madam Chair. This provision very clearly states that you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=126.16s)]
*  no longer have to register silencers with the ATF. Is that wrong? Is that incorrect? That does not mean [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=135.84s)]
*  that you will not go through a background check. It will be sold the same way a rifle is. That's not the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=142.32s)]
*  question I asked, Mr. Scott. I asked whether this provision. Don't yell at me. I gave you an answer [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=147.04s)]
*  you don't like. It's over with. This provision very clearly states. Ask. Let Mr. Negus ask a question [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=151.6s)]
*  and answer it please, Mr. Scott. The National Firearm Act for 100 years since the days of Al Capone, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=158.88s)]
*  which is the impetus behind the National Firearm Act in the first instance, has required [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=169.92s)]
*  registration for those purchasing silencers. That was the case up until 45 minutes ago [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=175.12s)]
*  when Republicans negotiated the elimination of that registration requirement. Fairly straightforward. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't really know who in the Republican caucus was adamant that this provision was the key to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=194.16s)]
*  unlocking their support. And I don't believe anyone here, excuse me for interrupting, but I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=201.12s)]
*  don't think anybody here knows that either, Mr. Negus. Got it. Then the Democrats continued to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=205.84s)]
*  press these MAGA Republicans and point out that the MAGA Republicans don't even know what the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=210.56s)]
*  hell is in this budget bill and why in this budget bill are we prioritizing, or I should say the MAGA's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=215.76s)]
*  and the Trump's prioritizing tax breaks for silencers while kicking 14 million Americans [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=222.56s)]
*  off of Medicaid. And we learned that this disastrous budget is also kicking people off of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=230.24s)]
*  Medicare too. Play this clip. This long-standing federal policy should be overturned in the middle [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=235.68s)]
*  of the night and I'd urge a yes vote on my amendment. Yes, I'll yield to Mr. Scott. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  It's actually not a silencer, it's a suppressor. It doesn't suppress. I'm sorry, it is still my time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=250.08s)]
*  If we look at your manager's amendment, it says that the section is amended by striking any silencer. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=257.68s)]
*  And you can look up the National Firearms Act. I'm sorry, it's still my time and I'm [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=268.0s)]
*  yielding to Mr. McGovern. I would just say I support it. Never mind then, I thought you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=272.16s)]
*  would engage in a debate. I'm opposed to it. I have yielded to it. Of course you are. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=276.56s)]
*  And Democratic Congresswoman Fernandez was bringing the fight. Here's what she had to say. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=281.76s)]
*  Play this clip. There is a better explanation and that is because we are not, because we are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=287.2s)]
*  continuing the tax cuts that were in the TCJA, it is being done as a cautionary measure to make [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=294.96s)]
*  sure that there is nothing seen in here that would implicate a tax increase. But Madam Chair, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=309.36s)]
*  if you are describing those tax cuts, you would not need an authorization for a tax rate increase. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=318.24s)]
*  This is about increasing your taxes. So you are authorizing the increase of taxes without [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=326.88s)]
*  requiring the vote. And another hat tip to Democratic Congressmember Neguse grilling [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=336.72s)]
*  Jim Jordan so hard in the morning that Jordan had to consult with lawyers. Hat tip to Aaron [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=346.8s)]
*  Ruper for picking up this clip right here. Play this clip right here. We'll walk through it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=354.24s)]
*  together here. A constituent in Ohio who believes that their information was improperly released [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=359.2s)]
*  by the IRS. I remember you've served on the judiciary committee for many years. Hold on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  We're talking about in the context of immigration cases. This is all cases. This is not immigration [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=372.32s)]
*  cases. The plain language of this statute that you have written applies to every conceivable case [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=378.32s)]
*  brought in a federal court. Period. IRS cases, patent cases, immigration cases. If you have a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=384.64s)]
*  constituent that sues the ATF, this provision applies to them. This is the point. And I don't, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  you can visit with your lawyers and maybe they can provide you with this, the clarity. But it is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  unquestionably the case that this provision applies to every plaintiff. Oh, okay. Yeah, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  that's correct. I think we're on the same page now. The judge can set the security at whatever [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=408.56s)]
*  level he wants. What typically happens in these cases is he's just waiving it. No one's putting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=413.36s)]
*  it up and they're getting this injunction that applies nationwide, which is the concern. Are you [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=417.2s)]
*  okay with the nationwide injunction issued by one single federal judge? We'll get to that part, Mr. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=421.76s)]
*  Jordan. Let's complete the analysis on this piece because to your point, as you said, this particular [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=425.6s)]
*  provision doesn't require a specific amount of security. It's essentially saying to the federal [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=431.68s)]
*  court, it has to require some security. And my point is that this is a deep deviation from [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=436.88s)]
*  existing federal law. This has never been the case. We've never said to constituents, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=444.08s)]
*  we've never said to American citizens and constituents that in order to vindicate their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=451.84s)]
*  rights in federal court, they're going to be required to provide a security when their [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=456.64s)]
*  constitutional rights have been violated by their government. And I find it astounding. I'm not [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=462.72s)]
*  sure that many of your colleagues understand the full import of this. They will by the time [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=468.72s)]
*  this gets to the floor. I imagine there will be a lot of limited government advocates who will find [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=473.76000000000005s)]
*  deep reasons to be concerned about this type of provision because as you could imagine, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  it will preclude folks from being able to vindicate their constitutional rights. Now, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=485.6s)]
*  I would also say the way that you have written it, as you've noted, it's retroactive. Right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=489.52s)]
*  This applies to any- Well, I just want to say the situation we're trying to address is what's been [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=496.4s)]
*  happening around the country. You didn't write it that way. As you know, a single federal judge gets [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  cases brought to the judge. They waive the security and then issue a decision that applies [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=511.44s)]
*  nationwide to all immigrants who are in that situation. Why didn't you put nationwide in this [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=516.64s)]
*  language? Well, we can look at the language. I mean- It's 6 a.m. You're voting on this thing [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=522.0s)]
*  in like 10 hours. What are we talking about? And by the way, not just hat tip to Aaron Rupert, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=526.88s)]
*  but to our very own Asin, A-C-Y-N, the superstar clipper himself who uses the software called [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=530.8s)]
*  Snapstream for all of his clipping. Shout out to Snapstream, which he uses and we use to get these [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  clips. That's how he watches all of these screens at the same time. Here, Asin is showing another [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=544.4s)]
*  committee hearing. This was not about the budget. This was just about basic due process. And [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=550.64s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett had to school MAGA Republican Congressmember Kylie [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  about the basics of due process. It's gloves off, but it's also education time for these MAGA [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=563.92s)]
*  Republicans to read the freaking Constitution. Here, play this clip right here. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=571.28s)]
*  Do process requirements for that individual are the same as they are for a U.S. citizen? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=601.28s)]
*  I thought the question was for me, but it seems like the lawyers on this side or just my entire [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=608.48s)]
*  team knows the answer. Mr. Chairman? Per the Constitution, yes, if you are on our soil, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=613.04s)]
*  you are guaranteed due process. And the fact that there's even a question is why we are struggling [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  right now. In addition to an additional issue that I have is the executive order that was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=629.68s)]
*  signed by the president that seemed to get rid of birthright citizenship, which also is laid out [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  in the Constitution, which is why even the most conservative judges have ruled against. There is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=645.12s)]
*  no one that has ruled that that was okay. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=653.2s)]
*  That's simply untrue. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that due process is a context [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=659.6s)]
*  dependent inquiry. And someone who is here illegally in this country, facing deportation, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=665.44s)]
*  the requirements of due process are specific to that. I just want to clarify. And I know that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  there's lawyers on that side. It's just like we have different standards in general. Like you have [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  a higher standard when it comes to a criminal case versus a civil case, right? So its preponderance [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=682.8s)]
*  is going to be the burden on a civil case. And then it's going to be higher as relates to a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  criminal case, right? It's beyond a reasonable doubt. That is going to be the burden of proof. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=695.52s)]
*  When the Supreme Court was making distinctions, the distinctions weren't necessarily [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=700.8s)]
*  between is this person a citizen or is this person not? It wasn't a matter of certain people are not [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=705.92s)]
*  allowed to have due process. But it's kind of like there's different ways to evaluate things. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=712.72s)]
*  The amount of protections that you are going to have in any criminal case. If you think about those [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=720.0s)]
*  that are charged with murder, whether they are a citizen or not, guess what? The burden of proof is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=724.96s)]
*  still going to be the same. The burden of proof is still going to be beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=730.32s)]
*  There was never a distinction that said somehow, depending upon your status, you somehow lose [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=734.96s)]
*  your access to due process. And frankly, that is honestly the only thing that the Supreme Court [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=742.08s)]
*  has been consistent on is that there are due process rights that are going to be afforded to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=747.84s)]
*  everyone that is found within our jurisdiction in the United States. I have not seen a case [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=753.76s)]
*  where they have said, no, it's okay for someone not to have due process. That is why the plane [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=759.6s)]
*  was about to leave Texas. They said stop the plane literally at one in the morning because [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=766.24s)]
*  there had not been due process for those that were currently being held in the administration's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=772.32s)]
*  custody. And thank you so much. The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=777.92s)]
*  has a huge impact on your sleep quality. If you wake up too hot or too cold, I highly recommend [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=782.24s)]

*  yourself. Thank you, Miracle Maid, for sponsoring this episode. Want to give a hot tip to Democratic [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=894.24s)]
*  Congresswoman Brown right here who's asking? This is simple and straightforward. Who is striking [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=900.56s)]
*  work requirement provisions that are now saying eight-year-olds are no longer dependents? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=909.04s)]
*  Eight-year-olds are no longer dependents as a way for you to kick children off of their health care? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=916.8s)]
*  Play this clip. My amendment would strike an especially harsh provision in this bill that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=924.4s)]
*  is rooted in cruelty, not policy. This simple, straightforward amendment would strike the work [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=929.52s)]
*  requirement provision in this big, bad, ugly bill that lowers the age of what we call a dependent [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=935.52s)]
*  child from 18 to seven. From 18 years old to seven years old. So I'm abundantly clear. We're [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=942.48s)]
*  saying that eight, nine, and 10-year-olds are no longer considered dependent children. Where did [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=951.28s)]
*  this come from? Why is this necessary? Since when is a first grader not a dependent child? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=958.88s)]
*  Preventing families with children as young as seven from losing food assistance? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=967.52s)]
*  That is what we're debating here. And I like this tactic here by Democratic Congress member Kassar [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=972.32s)]
*  from Texas. I'm sure you've seen him a lot on the MIDAS Touch Network. And here he goes, look, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=979.92s)]
*  who wants to debate me? I will hand my mic over and yield to anybody who wants to explain to me [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=985.12s)]
*  how we are okay with now kicking people off health care or making health care so [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=993.12s)]
*  unaffordable so you can give your tax cuts to the billionaires. I'm waiting. I'll yield. Who [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1001.92s)]
*  wants to debate? Of course, there were no takers. Play this clip. I will hand the mic over, yield my [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1007.52s)]
*  time to any of my Republican colleagues that want to address the amount of money that their tax [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1013.36s)]
*  paying citizens are going to have to pay in increased premiums for their health care. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1019.2s)]
*  Anybody wants to mention, we have the numbers, everybody here has the numbers, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1026.32s)]
*  how much your constituents are going to have to pay more every year in health care because of this [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1030.4s)]
*  bill? I don't know the numbers for my district. It's going to be a 50% increase, over $400 [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1036.32s)]
*  in my district. And that's actually not even close to how much in many of the Republican districts [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1045.4399999999998s)]
*  there's going to be an increase. I would yield the mic. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1051.28s)]
*  I think we're 78% in my district. 78% in Mr. McGovern's district. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1057.4399999999998s)]
*  Maybe none of the Republican members want to mention it, but the gentleman, Republican [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  gentleman from New York, there would be a 44% increase, $2,000 a year hit to his constituents [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1071.04s)]
*  in their health care costs. The distinguished gentleman from Virginia, his constituents would [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1077.52s)]
*  face an increase in $770 a year in their health care premiums. The distinguished Republican chairwoman [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1085.52s)]
*  of this committee, a 60% increase in health care premiums. And that's on average. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1092.48s)]
*  The distinguished Republican congresswoman here from Minnesota was recently told here by the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1097.68s)]
*  committee on the budget that a 60-year-old couple with a joint income of $85,000 a year in her [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1104.24s)]
*  district would see an $11,000 a year increase in their costs while we're giving tax cuts to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1110.08s)]
*  billionaires. And what bothers me the most is that we want to hide it. Nobody wants here to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1116.88s)]
*  talk about the fact that they're jacking up insurance costs on their own constituents while [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  giving a billionaire a tax break. Nobody on the Republican side pushing this bill wants to have [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1126.72s)]
*  an in-person town hall and look at their constituents in the face and explain to them why they want to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1131.7600000000002s)]
*  hand Elon Musk another $25 billion contract while jacking up your health insurance costs, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  not just by hundreds but by thousands of dollars. I yield back. And I think this issue is so [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1143.2s)]
*  underrated and needs more attention right now. FEMA, FEMA, FEMA, FEMA. We're what, one week away [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1149.04s)]
*  from hurricane season right now and the Trump regime has completely gutted FEMA. We see FEMA [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1155.68s)]
*  not responding in disasters in red states and blue states, purple states, but even like to Arkansas [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1162.72s)]
*  and Mississippi, we're seeing in Missouri that FEMA was not reacting to the devastating storms. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1169.84s)]
*  We, 28 Americans died and Donald Trump hasn't mentioned it. Instead, Donald Trump is out there [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  posting white supremacist brain rot from South Africa, lying that there are these mass graves [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1183.04s)]
*  from a genocide that's not happening, making a complete fool of the United States and the Oval [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1190.48s)]
*  Office. That's what Donald, while you have the president Ramaphosa of South Africa saying, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1196.32s)]
*  what is going on? I'm sorry I can't buy you a jet, but what the hell is going on? FEMA, FEMA, FEMA. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1201.52s)]
*  And here you have Democratic Congress member Moskowitz who ran emergency management in Florida [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1207.6s)]
*  before being a member of Congress saying it loud. Danger, danger. You're cutting FEMA and we are [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1213.28s)]
*  heading into hurricane season. What the hell's going to happen? There's going to be a mass [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  casualty event. Here, play this clip right here. Nothing at FEMA has been made more efficient. In [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1223.44s)]
*  fact, I would tell you that the secretary of Homeland Security has turned FEMA into the Newark [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1229.28s)]
*  airport. Okay. It is going to fail this summer. And so look, there's no doubt that FEMA needed [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1233.44s)]
*  reform, but what they've done at Homeland is they've taken something that needed help and they broke [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1241.04s)]
*  it further. Do you know what happens if there's no FEMA to the state that the speaker represents [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1246.56s)]
*  or Steve Scalise represents? Louisiana goes bankrupt without FEMA when there's a hurricane [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1252.0s)]
*  that comes in from the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of America, comes right into Louisiana. They're [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1257.04s)]
*  bankrupt. Alabama's bankrupt. Mississippi's bankrupt. You get an F5, F4 tornado in tornado [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1262.48s)]
*  alley. Those states go bankrupt without FEMA. And yet, I don't see my Republican colleagues [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1269.84s)]
*  calling out the administration on how we're going to save FEMA and reform it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. Democrats fighting back, fighting back. And that's just what I want [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1283.28s)]
*  to see right now. We've said it before. We've heard you say it where it's like, I don't want [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1288.96s)]
*  to hear Democrats saying, oh, we don't have the power. We're not in the majority, so there's [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1294.4s)]
*  nothing we can do. No, take the gloves off. Fight. Fight in Congress. Peacefully protest on the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeSMABGJm8&t=1299.28s)]
