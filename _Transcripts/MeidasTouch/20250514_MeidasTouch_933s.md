# Trump has DERANGED MELTDOWN as Plan BLOWS UP
**MeidasTouch:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA)
*  So, Donald Trump is still ranting and raving like a lunatic about that $400 million bribe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=0.0s)]
*  that he wants from Qatar in the form of a gold-plated 747 jet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=7.08s)]
*  So here's what he was posting yesterday evening. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  He writes, The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force Department of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=17.84s)]
*  Defense. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=23.92s)]
*  Not me! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=24.92s)]
*  It is a gift from a nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=27.84s)]
*  It will be used by our government as a temporary Air Force One until such time as our new Boeings, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=33.14s)]
*  which are very late on delivery, arrive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=40.04s)]
*  Why should our military and therefore our taxpayers be forced to pay hundreds of millions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=43.0s)]
*  of dollars when they can get it for free from a country that wants to reward us for a job [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=48.24s)]
*  well done? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=54.78s)]
*  These big savings will be spent instead to make America great again! [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=55.78s)]
*  Only a fool would not accept this gift on behalf of our country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=61.94s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=66.7s)]
*  Really Donald? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=71.26s)]
*  I mean this at the same time that the GOP tax bill will be raising the debt ceiling [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=72.26s)]
*  by $1, 2, 3, 4 trillion dollars. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=78.06s)]
*  This says you're raising our defense budget to $1 trillion dollars the most ever. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=83.46s)]
*  This as Doge has not given the United States any savings, but has caused a massive, massive [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  amount of waste and abuse. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=98.46s)]
*  Doge itself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=100.78s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, you're cutting $290 billion from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=101.78s)]
*  program, which helps over 42 million people nationwide purchase fresh produce and other [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=112.02s)]
*  groceries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=120.22s)]
*  And you also want to cut Medicaid by $800 billion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=121.22s)]
*  This is why I refer to Donald Trump as the Ponzi scheme rug pull presidency right here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=127.22s)]
*  He looks at the suffering of the people of the United States and he sees that vulnerability [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=134.44s)]
*  the way he's always seen it as a predator. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=141.54s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=144.5s)]
*  He's a fraud. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=145.94s)]
*  He is a sexual abuser. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=147.26s)]
*  He is a disgusting and vile piece of trash who has destroyed and not built his entire [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=149.82s)]
*  life, destroying the lives of workers, destroying the lives of contractors, anybody who's come [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=156.86s)]
*  into contact with him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=162.78s)]
*  He's destroyed their lives. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=164.62s)]
*  He is the snake that people let in and it's too late by the time he ruins your life. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=166.22s)]
*  But then he moves on to the next Ponzi scheme, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=172.86s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to cut health care costs 50 to 90% via an executive order. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=176.06s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=182.74s)]
*  You're getting rid of Medicaid before our eyes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=184.14s)]
*  You're getting rid of SNAP. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  You're getting rid of other critical programs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=188.92s)]
*  You ain't going to cut health care via an executive order just because you say so. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=191.18s)]
*  That's part of his scam. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=195.82s)]
*  And now we're also seeing that the way he framed no tax on tips and no tax on social [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=198.38s)]
*  security and no tax on overtime. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=204.06s)]
*  I'm going to do a whole other video about this this morning. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=206.22s)]
*  It is a scam and the carve outs essentially swallow the underlying promise. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  Promises broken all around. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=216.5s)]
*  But guys, Donald Trump had a great day in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=218.5s)]
*  Three exclamation points. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=223.22s)]
*  How great of a day it was because you see the Saudi sovereign wealth fund gives hundreds [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=225.02s)]
*  of millions and billions of dollars to the Trump family. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=230.74s)]
*  Trump resorts in Oman. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump resorts there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=236.0s)]
*  So of course, Donald Trump is going to the Middle East for people who pay him money. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=237.66s)]
*  Why do you think Donald Trump doesn't like Canada, doesn't like Europe, doesn't like [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=242.26s)]
*  places that are rooted in democracy and aren't trying to overtly or even implicitly bribe [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=247.14s)]
*  him who are actually running modern democracies because they ain't paying him off like the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=255.5s)]
*  Abu Dhabi Crypto Fund or even Syria is getting in the action right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=261.34s)]
*  Syria's leader said, oh, shit, all we got to do, excuse my language, all we got to do [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=266.46s)]
*  is get say we want to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=271.34s)]
*  He'll remove the sanctions against us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=274.82s)]
*  So Syria said we want to do Trump Tower within 24 hours. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=276.46s)]
*  Donald Trump announces, all right, the sanctions against Syria are off. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=280.14s)]
*  Seriously, seriously. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, it's so odd as well to see Trump and all these MAGA influencers saying Saudi Arabia [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=287.82s)]
*  loves us. Yeah, Saudis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=295.46s)]
*  It's very strange for me as an American to be like our nation has attacked Canada and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=297.58s)]
*  our European allies and we suck up to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and we're begging for the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=304.3s)]
*  seconds of Qatar's airplanes for dear leader Donald Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=311.82s)]
*  Like, are you kidding me? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=317.26s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's chief propagandist, goes, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  after Trump's fantastic speech in Riyadh. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=324.1s)]
*  This is like sheer pink dress lady crap from North Korea. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=327.18s)]
*  He clapped for Donald. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=331.3s)]
*  He clapped for Donald Mohammed bin Salman clapped for Donald. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=332.98s)]
*  Americans are suffering right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=338.1s)]
*  Seriously, Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, which is a form of psychological [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=341.18s)]
*  torture. Americans can't afford a home right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=346.18s)]
*  Americans need health care, good health care, and now they're going to get kicked off the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=350.38s)]
*  health care that they have, which could be better by the MAGA Republicans. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=355.3s)]
*  Americans need a good education. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=359.86s)]
*  Student loans right now have the highest delinquency rate essentially ever right now, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  as the only thing the Department of Education is doing is going after student loan [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=369.18s)]
*  delinquency and garnishing wages right now while gutting lunch programs to kids, gutting [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=374.06s)]
*  mental health services, even though MAGA Republicans say it's never the guns. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. What do they say? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=385.86s)]
*  They say it's always meant up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=386.62s)]
*  Well, you just cut mental health services. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=387.78s)]
*  You cut snap. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  You're cutting Medicaid. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=391.18s)]
*  That's what's in your actual budget right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  Foreign countries are looking at America like a banana republic. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=396.34s)]
*  That's what they're seeing it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=400.38s)]
*  As UBS Group has announced, their richest clients are increasingly shifting away from [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=401.86s)]
*  the United States dollar assets and turning instead to gold and crypto and investments [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=409.14s)]
*  in China, according to the Swiss Bank's co-head of wealth management in Asia, because [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=414.66s)]
*  they don't see the United States brand has been irreparably damaged. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=422.38000000000005s)]
*  I mean, just look at what Donald Trump did with China. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  And somehow our awful corporate news in America tries to act like Trump did a deal. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=430.98s)]
*  Trump didn't do a deal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump engaged in a trade war against the world. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=440.26000000000005s)]
*  Recklessly and maliciously created a trade embargo with China, destroying businesses [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=444.1s)]
*  here in the United States, one hundred and forty five percent tariffs against China. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=451.94s)]
*  Then as ships stopped coming into our ports in the United States and we were about to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  have no products on our shelves and scarcity was about to reach a covid level, Donald Trump [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  sent Jameson Greer, our trade representative, and Scott Bessent, our Treasury secretary, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=470.06s)]
*  to Switzerland to beg China, to beg China to make it appear the United States came out [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=476.1s)]
*  with something. The United States got not a single concession. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=483.22s)]
*  Put in the comments what you think the United States got from this at all, other than to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=486.86s)]
*  look outmaneuvered and look stupid at this point, because all the United States did was [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=492.06s)]
*  reduce its tariffs against China from one hundred and forty five percent to thirty [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=496.94s)]
*  percent, which is still a thirty percent tax on the American consumer because a tariff [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=500.86s)]
*  is a levy on the importer who passes that through to the consumer. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=505.18s)]
*  And China smartly lowered its tariff rates to ten percent so it could tax its own [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=508.34s)]
*  citizens less. Meanwhile, China has engaged in lots of negotiations with other countries [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=512.74s)]
*  around the world to now appear to be a more stable trading partner than the United States. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=519.38s)]
*  This is being reflected in the 10 year Treasury rate, four point five percent. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=525.7s)]
*  The 10 year yield is not supposed to be that high. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=531.3s)]
*  When it is high, that reflects instability. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=535.54s)]
*  And that's often a sign as well of other things going up, like mortgage rates going up. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=538.78s)]
*  That is not good. Life moves fast and sometimes you just need a way to relax, recharge or [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=543.7s)]
*  stay focused without overcomplicating things. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=548.54s)]

*  What the hell have they been talking about? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=741.54s)]
*  Former President Biden. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=743.54s)]
*  They all are coming out with books. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=745.42s)]
*  Oh, former President Biden needed a wheelchair. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=746.9s)]
*  By the way, even if he needed a wheelchair, what are we just we just why? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=749.54s)]
*  Why can't you have a wheelchair like that? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=754.46s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, he didn't. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=756.42s)]
*  We saw him walk, but that's like a big scoop that Jake Tapper and all these idiots [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  are talking about. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=762.86s)]

*  No, he had a stable policy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=766.6600000000001s)]
*  You want to take a transcript of Biden and compare it to a transcript of Trump? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=769.5400000000001s)]
*  You know how I would answer the stupid question that now corporate news is asking all [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  of these people? When did you know about Biden? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=777.9s)]
*  I would say shut the F up. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=780.26s)]
*  I would say, first off, Donald Trump is one thousand times worse than anything we saw [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=782.7s)]
*  with Biden right in front of our eyes every single day. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=787.86s)]
*  Donald Trump does 20 to 30 things worse than I ever saw Biden do at all [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  during his presidency. And in any event, why is this year focused right now? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=795.58s)]
*  Donald Trump is engaging in a hostile takeover of our federal government. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=799.46s)]
*  He's trying to make sure we don't have elections ever again in our future. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=803.38s)]
*  He's taking bribes in plain sight. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=808.3000000000001s)]
*  He's rejecting and not following and defying clear Supreme Court orders. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=810.66s)]
*  He's running things via executive order as a dictator. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=815.42s)]
*  He's doing reckless trade wars against the world and then capitulating [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=819.22s)]
*  and making the United States look utterly pathetic. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=823.5s)]
*  The rest of the world sees the United States for what it is. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=826.74s)]
*  And you on May 14, 2025 are focused on former President Biden. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=829.98s)]
*  Are you freaking kidding me? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=835.26s)]
*  That's how I would answer those stupid and pathetic questions. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=837.54s)]
*  So, by the way, you have that taking place, right? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=841.02s)]
*  You have corporate news. That's their story. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=843.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's getting bribes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=846.62s)]
*  They're like, well, what about did Biden recognize Clooney? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=847.86s)]
*  Biden Clooney, what are you even talking about? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=851.58s)]
*  Ciro gives a shit right now. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=854.9000000000001s)]
*  Americans are suffering and our democracy is online. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=857.5400000000001s)]
*  This is what this is why people are leaving corporate news and watching [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=860.38s)]
*  the Midas. And then on the other side, right, that's like CNN. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=864.1400000000001s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qaMSwXwBA&t=867.5400000000001s)]
