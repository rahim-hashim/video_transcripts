# Trump gets NIGHTMARE NEWS as World Elections CRUSH HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54)
*  The Trump effect is real all across the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=0.0s)]
*  We're seeing the MAGA Trump-aligned candidates getting upset by the pro-democracy candidates. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  On Sunday, we saw this take place in Romania and Poland. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=16.88s)]
*  And over the past few weeks, we saw the Trump and MAGA-aligned candidates get upset in Canada [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=22.6s)]
*  and Australia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=29.84s)]
*  Also, I think that it is not a coincidence that Pope Leo was someone who was very critical [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=31.08s)]
*  of Trump's position on, or I should just call it torture, of migrants with JD Vans, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=39.44s)]
*  and that the Vatican elevated a new pope, signaling, I think, the belief that with Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=46.92s)]
*  in charge, America is on the decline, such that an American pope could be selected. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=54.44s)]
*  Let's break all of this down. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=61.16s)]
*  I want to also talk about Donald Trump's unhinged responses throughout the day. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=62.8s)]
*  But I think this post nicely sums everything up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=69.8s)]
*  They lost in Canada, they lost in Australia, Romania, and Poland, and I think we're going [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=73.2s)]
*  to be seeing more of this throughout the world. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=78.86s)]
*  Again, if you looked at the results in Romania and you compared it to what was projected [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=83.08s)]
*  just a few days ago, or especially even earlier in the month, where the far right-wing candidate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=89.68s)]
*  there, George Simeon, was expected to go on and win, and he actually won the first round. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=97.44s)]
*  No one had really predicted that there would be this type of commanding victory for the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  pro-democracy, pro-EU centrist candidate, Nacusia Dan, going on to beat the MAGA-aligned [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=109.6s)]
*  Simeon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  You go to Poland, we reported on this before as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  The liberal Warsaw mayor, Rafa≈Ç Trzawski, went on to beat the MAGA-Republican-aligned [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=123.08s)]
*  candidate, Karola Nowrocki, in the first round of the presidential elections in Poland. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=130.2s)]
*  June 1st will be the second round there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  Let me just show you the respective celebrations very quickly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=141.6s)]
*  Here in Romania, the mayor of Bucharest, the next leader of Romania, here he is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  You'll see him right here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=155.56s)]
*  Nacusia Dan, here he is right here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=157.04s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=160.32s)]
*  And here we see in Poland, Trzawski, the centrist. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's play the crowd right there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, in addition to just these elections, one of the things we're seeing as well is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  the world recognize how much of a bad negotiator Donald Trump is and how weak he is and how [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=185.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has just been capitulating and or announcing fake deals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=192.92s)]
*  When Donald Trump got outmaneuvered by China, that was a watershed moment where Trump claimed [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=199.2s)]
*  he had a deal with China last week after meetings in Switzerland. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  But obviously there wasn't a deal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=211.0s)]
*  They reached a consensus where the United States completely caved and withdrew 145% [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=212.76s)]
*  tariffs that Trump said was going to make America so rich and moved it to 30%. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=218.84s)]
*  Also, you dig into the fine print of, not even the fine print, just the big print of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=223.68s)]
*  Trump's purported deal with the UK. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=228.72s)]
*  Not a real deal at all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  It actually says this is not a real, it says it's not an actual binding deal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=233.2s)]
*  But what it would do is give significant advantages to Jaguar, Land Rover, and Rolls-Royce over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  American car manufacturers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=245.32s)]
*  So the whole world is seeing that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=247.6s)]
*  Also Moody's, the credit agency, downgraded the US credit score for the first time in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=249.56s)]
*  Moody's history since 1917. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=255.4s)]
*  The world sees all of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=258.56s)]
*  And right now China-US trade truce, that's how Bloomberg calls it, more like capitulation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=260.2s)]
*  by the US, prompts all of these other nations to consider tougher tactics against Donald [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=265.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=271.52s)]
*  Quote, there are many countries that may learn from China that the correct way to negotiate [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=272.52s)]
*  with Trump is to stand firm, remain calm, and force him to capitulate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=277.32s)]
*  Now right before the markets open this morning, we see that the treasury futures are in a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=283.88s)]
*  steep decline after Moody's cut the US credit rating. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=291.44s)]
*  Bonds getting drilled right now, as Spencer Akimian puts it, at the open. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=296.52s)]
*  4.53% is the 10-year yield. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that going to hit a five-handle soon? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=305.08s)]
*  That's what I'm going to be focusing on. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=308.44s)]
*  When I say five-handle, I mean 5%. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=309.68s)]
*  This is going to impact everything from causing mortgage rates to skyrocket. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=312.96s)]
*  It's going to make it very difficult for the United States to refinance its debt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=317.64s)]
*  And this disastrous budget deal, or this budget bill rather, that Trump is pushing through, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  $6 trillion to the deficit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=330.8s)]
*  And it just last night, very late last night, was approved by the Budget Committee on a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=334.16s)]
*  vote of 17 to 16 with those four previous no votes abstaining and just not voting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=340.2s)]
*  But it passed the Budget Committee by one vote. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=347.98s)]
*  It now goes through the next steps. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=350.48s)]
*  But we're seeing as well the markets, at least the futures, which is when I'm recording [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=352.76s)]
*  this, showing a steep decline as well on the news of Moody's downgrading the United States [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  credit. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=365.96s)]
*  Now, this would be something, this would be a time where you'd want real leadership, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=366.96s)]
*  Nope, not from Donald Trump. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=372.56s)]
*  All throughout yesterday, he was posting weird memes of himself holding swords that he reposted [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=374.32s)]
*  from QAnon death cult accounts like SpiritualStreetFighter17. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=380.12s)]
*  That account says, I support QAnon, is basically what it says. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=385.4s)]
*  So Trump keeps reposting QAnon death cult stuff. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=389.36s)]
*  He also was posting weird videos of himself. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=392.68s)]
*  I guess he was so self-conscious of the fact that Bruce Springsteen was mocking him or [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=396.56s)]
*  criticizing him for the disaster he's caused to Americans. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=402.48s)]
*  Trump was posting weird AI images of himself playing fake music in front of a fake crowd. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=406.72s)]
*  Very bizarre behavior indeed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=412.44s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was posting calls for military tribunals to put former president [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=414.6s)]
*  Obama on military tribunals, also repost from those QAnon accounts. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=421.44s)]
*  I mean, look, this is a demented sicko, a vile piece of trash, a felon, a fraud, a sexual [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  abuser who behaves like a maniac. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=435.0s)]
*  Would you be like, oh my God, Jeffrey Dahmer? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=438.56s)]
*  He behaves, he's eating people. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  He's a mass murderer. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=443.68s)]
*  Well, he's a disgusting, vile murderer. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=448.64s)]
*  When you look at Donald Trump, he is a criminal, felon, fraud, bankruptor. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=449.68s)]
*  He behaves as such. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=455.48s)]
*  There's a reason that people like Donald Trump should be locked up in prison for the rest [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=457.12s)]
*  of their lives, in my opinion, and not running a country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=461.64s)]
*  We're seeing the effects of this right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=465.16s)]
*  And then surrounding themselves with other vile and despicable individuals like the Treasury [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=467.56s)]
*  Secretary Scott Besson, who's worth basically a billion dollars, who previously lived in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  a this is how weird these people are in a real world, a real life version of the Pink [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  Barbie Mansion. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  That's where he lived. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=486.68s)]
*  And here he was doing the morning shows yesterday blaming former President Biden for the reason [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=488.38s)]
*  that Donald Trump was taking bribes from Qatar. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  Play the clip. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  It sends the wrong message and raises concerns ethically, raises concerns constitutionally [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=500.64s)]
*  and about security. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=505.23999999999995s)]
*  Why is it appropriate for the president to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's not the president accepted to be the United States government. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=512.04s)]
*  And Senator Mullins said this weekend that the talks had actually begun under the Biden [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=515.76s)]
*  administration. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=521.24s)]
*  So, but Kristen, what I can tell you is I think this is a off ramp for many in the media [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=522.44s)]
*  not to acknowledge what an incredible trip this was that President Trump has brought [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=532.28s)]
*  back trillions of investments in the United States. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=536.8s)]
*  Every stop we made that the enthusiasm in Saudi Arabia, in Qatar, in the United Arab [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=540.8s)]
*  Emirates to invest in the United States, that they want to push more and more. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  They have funds here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  And if we go back to your initial question on the Moody's downgrade, who cares? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=556.12s)]
*  Qatar doesn't, Saudi doesn't, UAE doesn't. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=561.7600000000001s)]
*  They're all pushing money in. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  They want to, they've made 10 year, they've made 10 year investment plans. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=565.96s)]
*  So this administration, we're doing peace deals, trade deals and tax deals. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=571.08s)]
*  Also on the morning shows, though, you had a former vice president, Mike Pence, who was [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=577.56s)]
*  actually very critical of Donald Trump taking gifts from Saudi Arabia, which was, which [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=582.88s)]
*  supported 9-11, Qatar, which supports Hamas. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=590.28s)]
*  Here's what Pence had to say yesterday. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=594.56s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=596.48s)]
*  Going to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to use as a temporary Air Force [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=597.48s)]
*  one. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=603.88s)]
*  Donate that to his presidential library. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=605.36s)]
*  Do you think President Trump should accept a military aircraft from Qatar? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=608.0s)]
*  Well, I think first we've got to remember who Qatar is. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=614.0s)]
*  We've got a military base there. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=617.84s)]
*  I have members of our immediate family that have deployed to the region. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  But Qatar has a long history of playing both sides. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=624.24s)]
*  They support Hamas. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=628.32s)]
*  They supported Al Qaeda. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=630.24s)]
*  Qatar has actually financed pro-Hamas protests on American campuses across the United States. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=632.44s)]
*  And so the very idea that we would accept an Air Force one from Qatar, I think, is [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=639.84s)]
*  inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  And my hope is the president reconsidered it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=652.7600000000001s)]
*  And here, Pence talks about how despicable it is for Donald Trump to be in Saudi Arabia [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=656.48s)]
*  and Qatar and the United Arab Emirates questioning the, attacking United States leadership in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=663.52s)]
*  the world in Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=674.48s)]
*  Kristen, I've never been a fan of American presidents criticizing America on foreign [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=675.48s)]
*  soil and to have the president in Saudi Arabia questioning America's global war on terror [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=680.64s)]
*  and describing it as nation building and interventionist. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=691.28s)]
*  I thought was a disservice to generations of Americans who wore the uniform, who took [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  the fight to our enemy, you know, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=700.04s)]
*  And particularly giving that speech in Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 9-11 hijackers [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  hailed from and not including Osama bin Laden, I thought was unfortunate. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=713.96s)]
*  Now, let me just show you what the Democrats were saying. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, here's what he had to say. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=724.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=727.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, my view is the overall narrative here was selling [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  out U.S. national interests for the private gain of his family business. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=733.64s)]
*  He essentially gave away the crown jewels of American AI and semiconductor technology [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=738.68s)]
*  to the Gulf in exchange. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=745.56s)]
*  In exchange, it looks like for a two billion dollar investment in the Trump family stable [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=747.4s)]
*  coin venture. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=753.4s)]
*  I did a whole other video about this, but let me just say it at the end of this video. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=754.16s)]
*  Of course, our heart goes out to President Biden and his family after that horrible, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=758.08s)]
*  horrible cancer diagnosis. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=763.88s)]
*  We did a whole it was it was a very tough one for me to get through that video I did [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  yesterday and, you know, our deepest heartfelt sympathy. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=774.08s)]
*  Just send positive thoughts to the Biden family right now. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=779.64s)]
*  I had the opportunity to be one of the last reporters. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=782.08s)]
*  I may have been the last reporter to interview former President Biden inside the White House [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=786.24s)]
*  in December 2024. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=791.36s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=792.88s)]
*  When history is all told. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=793.88s)]
*  How do you want to be remembered? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=797.44s)]
*  What do you want your legacy to be? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=799.4000000000001s)]
*  I kept my word that when I said I was going to do something I did and that my focus has [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=803.84s)]
*  always been about how to give ordinary people a shot. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=813.64s)]
*  You've probably heard me say before, my dad, you say, Joey, your job is about a lot more [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=819.84s)]
*  than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=823.48s)]
*  It's about respect. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=826.4s)]
*  It's about being a look, your kid in the answer is going to be OK and mean it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=827.96s)]
*  It's about being able to be yourself and focus on people who need some help. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=831.92s)]
*  And the vast majority of American people, all they want is a chance, just a chance, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=838.76s)]
*  and they'll do fine. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=844.64s)]
*  You see hope? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=845.8s)]
*  I do. I am hopeful. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=846.96s)]
*  Powerful statements from former President Biden indeed. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=848.8s)]
*  And just to show you this kind of MAGA reality dystopia, Kid Rock is now with Lauren [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=853.28s)]
*  Boebert. That's like the full completion of MAGAVILLE. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=861.84s)]
*  Lauren Boebert and Kid Rock together. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSAY8Lqs54&t=867.64s)]
