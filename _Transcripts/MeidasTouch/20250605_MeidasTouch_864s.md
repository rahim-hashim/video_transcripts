# Trump Has PUBLIC MELTDOWN over Musk CIVIL WAR
**MeidasTouch:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE)
*  Donald Trump is currently having a public meltdown after Elon Musk started criticizing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's disastrous budget bill, and Donald Trump has just made a stunning admission, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=6.96s)]
*  although an admission that we all knew to be the case, that Doge was all a fraud from the outset, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  a way to protect Elon Musk's business interests. That's how Donald Trump is now attacking [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk and threatening Elon Musk after Elon Musk came out strongly against the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  disastrous budget bill. Here's what Donald Trump posted moments ago as this war between Trump and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=33.28s)]
*  Musk is really heating up. Trump writes, The easiest way to save money in our budget, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=38.96s)]
*  billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=45.84s)]
*  I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. Hmm. Why didn't you do it, Donald, if that's what [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=53.44s)]
*  you thought was the right thing to do? Oh wait, because he was running Doge? As Kyle Cheney posts, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=61.44s)]
*  in one post, Donald Trump eviscerates the entire basis for Doge and amplifies the conflicts of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=68.8s)]
*  interests Musk had as the head of the cost-cutting effort. Donald Trump just made a stunning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=76.88s)]
*  admission, an admission that may indeed be criminal as well. Shocking admission. Jonah Goldberg writes, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  Now Trump basically thinks the government has a trade deficit with Elon Musk and doesn't get [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=92.96s)]
*  anything in return for those contracts. It's kind of perfect. Then Donald Trump posted the following [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=99.36s)]
*  moments ago. Elon was quote, wearing thin. I asked him to leave. I took away his electric vehicle [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=105.12s)]
*  mandate, the EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  that he knew for months I was going to do. And he just went crazy! Exclamation point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  Then Elon Musk responds to an account called Autism Capital which wrote, Trump fires back at Elon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  The online battle begins. Popcorn emoji. Elon Musk writes, Such an obvious lie. So sad. And Elon Musk [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=136.64s)]
*  then makes the following threat. Seems like a bit of a threat. Oh, and some food for thought, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=147.04s)]
*  Musk writes, as they ponder this question. Trump has 3.5 years left as president, but I will be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=154.08s)]
*  around for 40 plus years. Then Elon Musk posts, Is it time to create a new political party in America [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  that actually represents the 80% in the middle? Then Elon Musk's baby mama, Ashley St. Clair, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  who's sued Elon Musk, she goes, Hey, at real Donald Trump, let me know if you need any [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=182.0s)]
*  breakup advice. Donald Trump attacks Elon Musk for forcing upon the Trump regime a guy by the name of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=189.44s)]
*  Jared Isaacman to lead NASA because Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats before. So Elon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=198.8s)]
*  Musk moments ago pointed out, This is what Donald Trump said about Jared Isaacman back on December [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  4th of 2024. I'm delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, Donald Trump wrote, An accomplished [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  business leader, philanthropist, pilot and astronaut as administrator of NASA. Jared will [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  drive NASA's mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  space, science, technology and exploration. Over the past 25 years as the founder and CEO of Shift [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=232.64s)]
*  4, Jared has demonstrated exceptional leadership, building a trailblazing global financial technology [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=241.44s)]
*  company. He also co-founded and served as CEO of Draken International, a defense aerospace company [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=248.88s)]
*  for over a decade, supporting the US Department of Defense and our allies. Jared's passion for space [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  astronaut experience and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=262.56s)]
*  mysteries of the universe and advancing the new space economy make him ideally suited to lead NASA [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=268.48s)]
*  into a bold era. Remember earlier today, Elon Musk posted the following, Without me, Trump would have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=275.68s)]
*  lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=283.36s)]
*  Such ingratitude. And then moments ago, Elon Musk dropped a bomb and he says, Time to drop the really [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=290.64s)]
*  big bomb, Elon Musk posts, Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. This is the real reason they have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=300.8s)]
*  not been made public. Have a nice day, D, J, T. Elon Musk pointing out what we've been pointing out [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=309.12s)]
*  here on the MidasTouch network over and over again. Trump is all over those files and there [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=317.92s)]
*  is a massive Department of Justice cover up by Pam Bondi and Cash Patel and others to hide the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=323.76s)]
*  Epstein files to protect Donald Trump. Elon Musk putting it in a post as this civil war between the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=331.6s)]
*  two escalates. Let's be honest, coffee isn't just a drink, it's survival. It's how I shift from half [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=338.32s)]
*  asleep zombie to fully functioning human being. And for me, that starts with trade. Listen, you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=343.68s)]
*  all know I take my coffee very seriously. Trade is the number one U.S. coffee destination working [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=348.88s)]
*  with over 50 of the best roasters around the country to deliver insanely fresh coffee matched [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  to your taste. Their team has tried thousands of roasts to narrow it down to over 450 incredible [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=359.12s)]
*  options. And somehow the first quiz I took nailed my preferences perfectly. I am loving the latest [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=364.08s)]
*  roast. I received a citrusy Ethiopian roast from Temple Coffee in Sacramento. It has notes of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=369.04s)]
*  tangerine, mango, and stone fruit and a smooth rich Colombian blend from good citizen roasters in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=373.68s)]
*  Nashville. Every bag arrives fresh, smells amazing, and the quality just blows grocery store coffee [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=379.6s)]
*  out of the water. And the best part, I never run out. I spend less than I did at cafes for better [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=385.68s)]
*  coffee and I'm supporting local roasters. Total win. Right now, trade is exclusively offering [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=391.12s)]

*  Go back to February 14th, 2025. Remember when Hannity interviewed Trump and Musk [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=415.04s)]
*  who were sitting together during the bromance period where Donald Trump said, Elon called me [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=423.44s)]
*  and said, they're trying to drive us apart. They're trying to drive us apart. We would never let that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=430.16s)]
*  happen. Here play this clip. They tried it, then they stopped. That wasn't what they have. Many [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=436.0s)]
*  different things of hatred. Actually, Elon called me. He said, you know, they're trying to drive us [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=441.04s)]
*  apart. I said, absolutely. No, they said, we have breaking news. Donald Trump has ceded control of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=447.28s)]
*  the presidency to Elon Musk. President Musk will be attending a cabinet meeting tonight at eight o'clock. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=453.44s)]
*  And I say, it's just so obvious. They're so bad at it. I used to think they were good at it. They're [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=460.4s)]
*  actually bad at it because if they were good at it, I'd never be president. Because I think nobody [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me. I could do the greatest things. I get 98% [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=470.88s)]
*  bad publicity. I could do outside of you and a few of your very good friends. It's like the craziest [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=477.44s)]
*  thing. But you know what I have learned, Elon? The people are smart. They get it. Yeah, they do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  They get it. They really see what's happening. Yes. Now, as we previously reported, Elon Musk [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=488.4s)]
*  stopped following Donald Trump's top advisor, Stephen Miller. Elon Musk previously hired Stephen [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  Miller's wife to work with Musk. No word on if Miller's wife is still going to be working with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=503.76s)]
*  Musk. But Miller's wife left working with Miller and Trump to work with Musk. Many rumors were taking [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  place online about that move. Elon Musk also unfollowed the ultra-maga right-wing influencer [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  guy, Charlie Kirk. That was something that went down as well. Elon Musk responded to Donald Trump's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=528.32s)]
*  statement in the Oval Office during that disastrous press conference with Friedrich Mars, the chancellor [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=537.6s)]
*  of Germany, where Trump goes, I'm very disappointed with Elon. I've helped him a lot. He knew the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=543.36s)]
*  inner workings of the bill better than anybody. I'll play that clip in just a moment. But Elon [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=549.36s)]
*  responds false. This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=554.48s)]
*  so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it. Here's what Trump said in the Oval Office. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=560.56s)]
*  But if they picked him, I would have won Pennsylvania. I won it by a lot. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=567.6s)]
*  But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=572.0s)]
*  anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=577.92s)]
*  it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=582.48s)]
*  going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars. And it really is [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  unfair. We want to have cars of all types. Electric. We want to have electric, but we want to have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  gasoline, combustion. We want to have different. We want to have hybrids. We want to have all. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=596.88s)]
*  We want to be able to sell everything. And when that was cut and Congress wanted to cut it, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=603.12s)]
*  it became a little bit different. And I can understand that. But he knew every aspect of this bill. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  He knew it better than almost anybody. And he never had a problem until right after he left. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=615.68s)]
*  And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I'm sure you can get very easily. It's very [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  fresh on tape. He said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn't said bad about me personally, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=624.88s)]
*  but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  I just want to clarify. Did he raise any of these concerns with you privately before he raised them [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=636.32s)]
*  publicly? And this is- To which Elon Musk responded, whatever, keep the EV solar incentive cuts in the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=642.72s)]
*  bill, even though no oil and gas subsidies are touched. Very unfair. But ditch the mountain of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  disgusting pork in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  that is both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this. Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=661.6s)]
*  beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way. Remember when Donald Trump was asked, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=667.52s)]
*  this was less than a week ago, were you aware of Elon Musk using drugs like ketamine and mushrooms [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=674.24s)]
*  during his time at Doge? Trump said, no, he's fantastic. I'm not troubled by anything that he [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=681.84s)]
*  does play this clip. It depends on whether you're going forward. I like this man. Were you aware of Elon [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=688.88s)]
*  Musk's regular drug use? No, I wasn't. I think he's fantastic. I think Elon is a fantastic guy. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=696.08s)]
*  And I'm not troubled by anything with Elon. I think he's fantastic. Did a great job. And you know, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=703.68s)]
*  Doge continues. And by the time it's finished, we'll have numbers that'll knock your socks off. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=711.04s)]
*  It's going to be a, he did a fantastic job and he didn't need it. He didn't need to do it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=716.88s)]
*  You will also recall during the last cabinet meeting or maybe the cabinet meeting before the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=722.64s)]
*  last cabinet meeting, a despicable one that is, Elon Musk was wearing a double hat. He was wearing [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=728.32s)]
*  two Trump hats on top of each other during the cabinet meeting at the White House. And Trump said [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRiaga8ecE&t=737.36s)]
