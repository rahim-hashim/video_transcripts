# Trump’s TERRIBLE SECRETS from Past SURFACE IN OVAL
**MeidasTouch:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o)
*  Donald Trump got stunned yesterday during a press conference in the Oval Office when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=0.0s)]
*  he was asked this very simple question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=4.92s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=7.48s)]
*  Mr. President, you said when can we expect you have seen documents from the press about [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=8.48s)]
*  — [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=13.92s)]
*  Which documents? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=14.92s)]
*  — you have seen files — [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=15.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=16.92s)]
*  I'll speak to the Attorney General about that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=17.92s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=18.92s)]
*  I know that we've done — we've done the RFK, the Kennedy, Martin Luther King is out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=19.92s)]
*  there very shortly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=26.12s)]
*  So we'll find out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=27.68s)]
*  But we've — and we've really, really announced — we're doing them in full transparency. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=29.28s)]
*  You know, when we did JFK, people would say, oh, maybe it wasn't all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=36.88s)]
*  It was all — [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=41.92s)]
*  Yeah, Donald, the question was not about the other files out there, which, by the way, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=42.92s)]
*  you didn't even release them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  You just released files that were already released. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=49.04s)]
*  Where are the Epstein files, Donald? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=52.0s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  You were very close friends with Epstein. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=56.24s)]
*  You said he was a great guy who likes women on the younger side. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=58.16s)]
*  You partied with him in Palm Beach. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  You flew with him on his Lolita Express at least seven times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=64.72s)]
*  You're on his flight logs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=68.8s)]
*  The documents from the Epstein criminal cases and civil cases that were released, Donald, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  they have your name all over it on the depositions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=76.08s)]
*  I see your name of victims that Epstein trafficked, saying that Epstein said he was on the phone [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  with you and they landed in Atlantic City to stop at one of your casinos. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=85.36s)]
*  In the criminal case involving Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein's traffickers, a woman who [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=90.32s)]
*  was 14 years old at the time said that she was introduced to you by Epstein, a 14-year-old [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=95.72s)]
*  girl. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=102.16s)]
*  Donald, we also know your statements as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=103.16s)]
*  We know that you've said that you would use your beauty pageants to inspect women naked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=106.4s)]
*  without their consent. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=111.76s)]
*  We've heard you talk about and brag about sexually assaulting women, grabbing them by [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=113.84s)]
*  their genitals without their consent. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=119.2s)]
*  We knew you were never going to release the Epstein files, but you all continued with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=121.8s)]
*  this farce. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=126.56s)]
*  Remember when Pam Bondi said that the files were going to be released? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=127.56s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=132.12s)]
*  Was that a month ago? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=133.12s)]
*  Pam Bondi said, there are truckloads of evidence relating to the Epstein case that has been [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=134.12s)]
*  delivered to the FBI headquarters. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=140.4s)]
*  And she said that she was going through them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=143.16s)]
*  Remember when she went on Hannity a few weeks back and she said this, play this clip. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=145.16s)]
*  Let me start with the Epstein case because there was an expectation that this was going [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=149.52s)]
*  to be bigger. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=154.44s)]
*  You had the same expectation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  We all did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=157.44s)]
*  And the FBI handed over a couple hundred pages of documents. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=158.44s)]
*  But you know, Sean, I gave them a deadline of Friday at 8 a.m. to get us everything. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=162.28s)]
*  A source had told me where the documents were being kept. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=167.52s)]
*  Southern District of New York, Shock. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=171.28s)]
*  So we got them all by hopefully all of them Friday at 8 a.m. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=173.68s)]
*  Thousands of pages of documents. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  I have the FBI going through them and cash is also now that we have cash here, it's a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=180.0s)]
*  game changer, of course. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  And cash is going to Director Patel is going to get us a detailed report as to why the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=185.44s)]
*  FBI withheld all of those documents. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=194.68s)]
*  With everything involving Donald Trump, he is a complete and utter fraud. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=195.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=201.8s)]
*  They threw that event at the White House. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=202.8s)]
*  When was that event at the White House? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=204.52s)]
*  Now, was that two months ago where they brought in all these right wing influencers? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=205.84s)]
*  They gave them a binder that said the Epstein files on the binder and then inside the binder [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=210.8s)]
*  were just Epstein's call list, which had previously been released. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=217.72s)]
*  By the way, Trump's name was on that too. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Not just Trump names, but like all of Donald Trump's contacts were all over there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=226.56s)]
*  Have you ever seen this graphic right here? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=231.52s)]
*  The cycle of Trump and Epstein. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump was best friends with Epstein. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=236.72s)]
*  True. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=238.28s)]
*  Trump does something that helps pedophiles. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=239.28s)]
*  Trump was best friends with Epstein. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=241.22s)]
*  Trump does something that helps pedophiles. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=243.0s)]
*  It's a pattern that repeats over and over again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=245.24s)]
*  Let me just show you all one of the exhibits. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=247.8s)]
*  Why Donald Trump is not releasing these Epstein files and why he's going to try to distract. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=250.88s)]
*  Oh, I released these other files that everybody cared about. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=255.88s)]
*  No, Donald, release the freaking Epstein files now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=258.44s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=261.4s)]
*  You're going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=262.88s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=264.88s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=268.88s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=275.88s)]
*  Go inside. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=276.88s)]
*  A decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=277.88s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=281.88s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men and telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=288.88s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and their appearances, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=297.88s)]
*  Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=303.88s)]
*  She's hot. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=308.88s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=312.88s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=319.88s)]
*  I was not a fan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=323.88s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous that people think that Donald Trump is somehow trying to stop Epstein or stop his behavior. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=324.88s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=334.88s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump during the campaign went on Fox and he was asked by Fox. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=336.88s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, is one of those hosts, Pete Hegseth, who's their secretary of defense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=342.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was asked about releasing the Epstein files. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=347.88s)]
*  You can literally see the fear and panic during the campaign when Trump was asked about it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=350.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=354.88s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=355.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=358.88s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=359.88s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=361.88s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=362.88s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=363.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=365.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=367.88s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=368.88s)]
*  I think that less so because, you know, you don't know. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=369.88s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=371.88s)]
*  But I think I would. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=378.88s)]
*  You know what's really getting under my skin these days? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=379.88s)]
*  The price of everything. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=381.88s)]
*  I mean, seriously, gas prices are high. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=382.88s)]
*  Food shopping feels like I'm emptying my bank account with every trip and don't even get me started on how expensive hearing aids can be. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=384.88s)]
*  Now, I've looked into them before for my family members and the price tag. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=391.88s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=394.88s)]
*  It's like they think that we all have money growing from money trees or something in our backyards. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=395.88s)]
*  But I have some good news. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=399.88s)]
*  Did you know MD Hearing has actually cut their prices in half despite everything getting more expensive? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=401.88s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=407.88s)]
*  This podcast is sponsored by MD Hearing and they are changing the game when it comes to hearing aids. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=408.88s)]
*  They make high quality, easy to use rechargeable hearing aids with exceptional sound quality, all personalized to your hearing profile. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=413.88s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=420.88s)]
*  MD Hearing's Neo rechargeable digital hearing aids are now only two hundred ninety seven dollars for a pair. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=421.88s)]
*  That's more than 90 percent less than what you'd pay at a clinic. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=428.88s)]
*  What's even better? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=432.88s)]
*  The Neo fits right inside your ear, so it's practically invisible. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=433.88s)]
*  And if that's not enough, MD Hearing just launched the Neo XS, their smallest hearing aid yet. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=436.88s)]
*  Now, my uncle has been using MD Hearing for a while. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=442.88s)]
*  And let me tell you, he could hear so much better. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=445.88s)]
*  The quality is just a game changer for him and he absolutely loves them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=447.88s)]
*  At just two hundred ninety seven dollars for a pair, you're getting something that's as good as those other brand names, but way more affordable. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=451.88s)]

*  MD Hearing was founded by an ENT surgeon who saw how many people needed hearing aids but couldn't afford them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=467.88s)]
*  So he made it his mission to create affordable, high quality hearing aids. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=473.88s)]

*  I have the the flight log from Epstein. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=527.88s)]
*  Trump's name is on it seven times. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=530.88s)]
*  We have Epstein's call log. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=532.88s)]
*  Trump's on that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=534.88s)]
*  Deposition transcripts. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=535.88s)]
*  Trump's on that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=536.88s)]
*  Trump's direct quote was Epstein. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=537.88s)]
*  I've known Jeff for 15 years. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=540.88s)]
*  Terrific guy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=542.88s)]
*  This was a quote in 2002. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=543.88s)]
*  He's a lot of fun to be with. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=544.88s)]
*  He's even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, many of them on the younger side. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=545.88s)]
*  Donald Trump held these beauty pageants like the Look of the Year competition in 1991 where he had like little girls like model and bathing suits in front of him. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=550.88s)]
*  And then the girls went on this boat, this yacht. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=559.88s)]
*  And Trump was on the yacht and there were men old enough to be these like 13, 14 year old girls, grandparents. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=563.88s)]
*  And like they'd have the girls grind on the grandparents. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=571.88s)]
*  I mean, disgusting stuff. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=573.88s)]
*  And there's like videos and photos of this thing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=576.88s)]
*  I mean, how about this? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=578.88s)]
*  Let me give you this data point. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=580.88s)]
*  This is Donald Trump from 18 months ago or so. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=582.88s)]
*  He was speaking at the Young Republican Club in New York. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=588.88s)]
*  Young Republicans. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=592.88s)]
*  So Republican teenagers, high school students, college students. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=593.88s)]
*  What Donald Trump said was that he was told by a general the most courageous thing he ever did was when he called sexually assaulting women, grabbing women by their genitals. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=600.88s)]
*  When he called that locker room talk, this is Trump's advice to kids that this was the most courageous thing he did. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=612.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=618.88s)]
*  But I went onto that stage just a few days later and a general who's a fantastic general actually said to me, sir, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=620.88s)]
*  I've been on the battlefield. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=628.88s)]
*  Men have gone down on my left and on my right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=630.88s)]
*  I stood on hills where soldiers were killed. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=632.88s)]
*  But I believe the bravest thing I've ever seen was the night you went onto that stage with Hillary Clinton after what happened. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=635.88s)]
*  And then that woman asked you the first question about it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=643.88s)]
*  And I said, locker room talk. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=647.88s)]
*  It's locker room talk. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=650.88s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=651.88s)]
*  What are you talking? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=652.88s)]
*  Locker room talk. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=654.88s)]
*  That was not a great. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=657.88s)]
*  You know, and then there's the clip of Donald Trump saying that he would inspect the girls at the beauty pageant or women at the beauty pageant. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=660.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=666.88s)]
*  Well, you could also say is the owner of the pageant. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=667.88s)]
*  It's your obligation to do that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=669.88s)]
*  So you have done that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=671.88s)]
*  I'll tell you, the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=673.88s)]
*  Yes. And everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=676.88s)]
*  And, you know, no men are anywhere. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=679.88s)]
*  And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=680.88s)]
*  And therefore, I'm inspecting it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=683.88s)]
*  You know, I'm inspecting. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=684.88s)]
*  I want to make sure they're like, is everyone OK? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=685.88s)]
*  You know, they're standing there with no clothes. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=688.88s)]
*  Is everybody OK? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=690.88s)]
*  And you see these incredible looking women. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=691.88s)]
*  And so I sort of get away with things like. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=693.88s)]
*  And this is what Donald Trump said about Lindsay Lohan. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=695.88s)]
*  I think she was 18 years old or just turned 18 years old at this time. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=697.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=700.88s)]
*  What do you think of Lindsay Lohan? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=701.88s)]
*  I think she's hot. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=703.88s)]
*  There's something there, right? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=704.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=705.88s)]
*  You have to like freckles. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=706.88s)]
*  I've seen a close up of her chest. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=707.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=710.88s)]
*  And a lot of freckles. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=711.88s)]
*  Are you into freckles? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=712.88s)]
*  If the father's a wreck like the way he is. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=715.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=717.88s)]
*  You imagine his sex with his troubled. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=718.88s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably right. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=719.88s)]
*  She's probably deeply troubled and therefore great in bed. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=720.88s)]
*  Back in the day. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=723.88s)]
*  How come the deeply troubled women. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=724.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=725.88s)]
*  You know, deeply, deeply troubled. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=726.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=727.88s)]
*  They're always the best at that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=728.88s)]
*  If for some reason what I said is true. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=729.88s)]
*  I mean, they're just unbelievable. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=732.88s)]
*  I can tell from the. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=733.88s)]
*  You don't want to be with them for the long term. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=734.88s)]
*  But for the short term, there's not. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=736.88s)]
*  You know, not to mention that Epstein would recruit victims from Mar-a-Lago like Virginia [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=738.88s)]
*  Jouffre when she was a minor. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=748.24s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell was at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=751.0s)]
*  Virginia Jouffre was one of the victims of Epstein. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=753.28s)]
*  She was homeless. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=756.88s)]
*  She was working at Mar-a-Lago as a job after being homeless. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=757.88s)]
*  Apparently her dad helped her get her job. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=762.0s)]
*  Our family member helped her get this job while being on the streets and homeless. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=763.48s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell found her working in Mar-a-Lago, brought her to Epstein. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=766.88s)]
*  Epstein trafficked her. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=770.2s)]
*  You know, and so there's all these data points. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=771.72s)]
*  Epstein was on Trump's jet with a girl. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=774.08s)]
*  Could have been 15, could have been 20, according to one of the witnesses. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=777.28s)]
*  It's not clear. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=780.64s)]
*  So release the files, Donald. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=782.02s)]
*  Release the freaking Epstein files already. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=784.12s)]
*  You know, I know corporate news doesn't want to talk about it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=786.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad whoever asked that question. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=788.84s)]
*  Remember Annapolina Luna, the Maga Republican congresswoman who created a whole subcommittee [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=791.24s)]
*  on this topic. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=795.36s)]
*  This is what she said back on February 27, 2025. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=796.72s)]
*  I know the task force were given a review the Epstein documents being released today [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=800.12s)]
*  and New York Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein's phone [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=804.64s)]
*  book. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  This is not what we or the American people asked for and a complete disappointment. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  Give us the information that we asked for. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=813.5s)]
*  Give us the information. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=815.72s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-FGMGJg5o&t=816.72s)]
