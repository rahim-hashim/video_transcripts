# Market Manipulation RED FLAGS SURFACE on Trump DECISION
**MeidasTouch:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4)
*  The question is a very simple one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=0.0s)]
*  Did Donald Trump intentionally tank the market by tariffing the world so that once the market [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=2.16s)]
*  crashed and he removed a lot of those tariffs or pressed pause on it and the market shot [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=7.16s)]
*  back up that he would enrich himself and his billionaire friends? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=12.84s)]
*  I want to explore this with you and I want to share with you what certain Democratic [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=16.6s)]
*  senators and members of Congress are doing as they demand investigations into whether [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=20.6s)]
*  market manipulation took place. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=26.48s)]
*  So let's take a look at this and analyze it through a legal prism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=28.56s)]
*  As a law professor, let me try to walk us all through this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  So earlier yesterday morning, kind of first thing in the morning, Donald Trump made the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=36.04s)]
*  following two posts. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=40.68s)]
*  Be cool. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=42.48s)]
*  Everything is going to work out well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=44.2s)]
*  The USA will be bigger and better than ever before! [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  He followed up by saying in all caps, this is a great time to buy! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=50.9s)]
*  Now, under United States securities law and really the very existence of the Securities [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=57.04s)]
*  and Exchange Commission is to prevent behavior like this because could you imagine if the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=66.2s)]
*  CEO of a company or an executive of the company posted out, buy the stock now, buy, buy, buy, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  what do you think would happen? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=78.28s)]
*  It would manipulate the market and people would go and buy or insiders would say that's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=79.28s)]
*  a signal and then maybe temporarily the stock would go up and then if it crashed again, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=83.72s)]
*  retail investors and people can get screwed, insiders can benefit off of this knowledge [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=89.56s)]
*  and the knowledge is contained and controlled by insiders. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=94.6s)]
*  That's why there are all these laws against insider trading. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=97.7s)]
*  So you know, Donald Trump and his regime members, all of his propagandists, the Treasury Secretary [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=101.52s)]
*  Scott Besson, the Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, his press secretary propagandist [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=106.42s)]
*  Caroline Levitt and Trump have been saying there will never be a pause ever in these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=111.56s)]
*  tariffs that Donald Trump placed against the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=116.72s)]
*  They will always remain in effect. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  Tariffs are the greatest thing ever. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=122.16s)]
*  It's going to make America rich. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=123.92s)]
*  We will not back down on tariffs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=125.72s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump's trade representative, who ostensibly is the person who came up with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=127.48s)]
*  the tariff formula, was testifying over the past two days, first in front of the Senate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=132.72s)]
*  then in front of the House of Representatives, saying that the tariffs will always remain [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=137.16s)]
*  in effect. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=141.76s)]
*  In fact, he was testifying, Jameson Greer was testifying to that effect that the tariffs [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=142.76s)]
*  are not going to be removed when Donald Trump then posted around noon yesterday, at least [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=147.84s)]
*  my time, based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=153.6s)]
*  I'm raising the tariffs to China, he says by 125%. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=158.48s)]
*  He then says though he's pausing the tariffs as it relates to everybody else. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=162.68s)]
*  He says the tariffs are otherwise going to be paused. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  The stock markets just started surging up and they went from crashing to basically having [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=173.28s)]
*  the best gains on a day-to-day basis in a very long time. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=180.84s)]
*  It should be noted that during some of the periods of the greatest market crashes, the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  great recessions of the 2008 period and also during COVID as well, some of the biggest [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=189.8s)]
*  losses were then followed by the biggest gains. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=197.8s)]
*  It's part, it's demonstrative of market volatility. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=201.0s)]
*  But while the market all of a sudden accelerated up, first question was, was there a test of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=205.74s)]
*  this a few days before? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Did the Trump regime or insiders test this out to see if this was going to make the market [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=217.44s)]
*  surge? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=226.28s)]
*  Did they run a test? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  I'll get into that in a second. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  But first I want to talk about tracking some of these exchange traded funds. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=230.48s)]
*  These exchange traded funds, they have these funny names like QQQ or like QQQT or SPY, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=238.0s)]
*  what all these exchange traded funds basically mean is they seek to provide investment results [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=246.92s)]
*  that before expenses correspond generally to the price and yield performances of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  different indexes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=260.28s)]
*  So like the QQQ follows NASDAQ, SPY follows the S&P 500. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=261.44s)]
*  So when you take a look at this, there's very suspicious trading taking place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  The unusual Wells account explains it over here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  Now that you have the background on QQQ and TQQQ, these are these exchange traded funds [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=275.52s)]
*  and SPY. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=280.78s)]
*  Remember, those just track the indexes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=281.78s)]
*  All right, this is what this account says. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, I think people knew of the tariff pause and traded on it beforehand. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  You can see before Trump posted buy on Truth Social, traders opened QQQ, TQQQ and SPY calls. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  Right before the news, someone opened SPY 509 calls expiring, get this, today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=301.8s)]
*  So those calls were up 2100% in one hour. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=311.44s)]
*  You take a look at these charts, you can see all of the volume that was literally open [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=316.72s)]
*  today. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=321.8s)]
*  Look at that little green arrow right there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=322.8s)]
*  You can see all the volume is new opening volume, not only on the zero days, but also [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=324.36s)]
*  on the weekly QQQ and TQQ calls. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=329.68s)]
*  This is especially odd given the IVR and these was around 82 this morning through the roof. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=333.26s)]
*  The traders really wanted to trade directionally here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=339.56s)]
*  In fact, using unusual Wells net premium, you can see people have been loading calls [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  trading for a reversal following these open calls. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=347.68s)]
*  Very clear example right here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=350.76s)]
*  And then other example, the market exploded a few hours later after Donald Trump paused [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  the tariffs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=359.8s)]
*  You can actually see right after Donald Trump posted on Trump media, on Truth Social, the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=360.8s)]
*  call premiums exploded. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=367.84s)]
*  So those traders who waited then though, they exited over 300% up today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=369.7s)]
*  You can see right here the behavior of the market right there, of people trading the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump media right there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=383.94s)]
*  So now go back, rewind a little bit for a second, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=386.48s)]
*  And remember what happened on April 7th, 2025. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=391.44s)]
*  Whatever this account is, this Walter Bloomberg account reported the following. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Kevin Hassett, Trump's top economic advisor, Trump is considering a 90 day pause in tariffs [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=402.16s)]
*  for all countries except China. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=410.6s)]
*  That was from Monday, April 7th. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=413.8s)]
*  And then the Trump regime walked it back. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=417.16s)]
*  But what we saw immediately is the stocks went up like a thousand points or like three, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=419.16s)]
*  four percent, and then they went down, down, down, down, down again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=424.36s)]
*  So the question was, was that information leaked out there into the market as a trial [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=429.04s)]
*  balloon as a test earlier in the week? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=435.2s)]
*  Then the Trump regime said, ah, I got it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  This will have the effect of pumping the market and we can create a pump and dump scenario. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=441.14s)]
*  I'm asking questions right here as a lawyer or as someone who was investigating this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=447.06s)]
*  These are the questions you'd want to ask as the Coffeezilla account posts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=452.38s)]
*  Wait, so the Monday fake news about the 90 day pause was actually real all along? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=456.9s)]
*  Spencer Hakimian, who I think has been doing a great job tracking all the chaos in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=463.5s)]
*  Trump financial markets, goes, by the way, the leaked pause news the other day, he believes [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=468.54s)]
*  was 100 percent intentional. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=474.66s)]
*  White House wanted to see how markets would react if and when they needed to exercise [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  their put. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=482.1s)]
*  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=483.1s)]
*  This account right here explains. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=486.26s)]
*  So someone and we've seen lots of trades like this, but this is just one trade as an example. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=488.26s)]
*  I want to give you specific examples of someone just trading on spy, the exchange traded [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=492.9s)]
*  fund tied to the S&P. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=498.85999999999996s)]
*  Someone bought $1.3 million of spy earlier. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=501.44s)]
*  They are now worth $33 million. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=506.21999999999997s)]
*  So someone who bought that earlier just made $33 million in one day. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=510.7s)]
*  You see the cycle of Trump decision making or lack thereof that we have on the Midas [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=515.72s)]
*  Touch Network. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=522.62s)]
*  I make stupid decisions. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=524.16s)]
*  Something really bad happens. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=526.66s)]
*  I convince my followers the problem is now magically solved. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=528.22s)]
*  I reverse my stupid decisions. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=532.26s)]
*  But within that is Trump and his oligarch buddies getting rich off of this is the question. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=535.76s)]
*  Now, Senator Adam Schiff is asking those questions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=541.14s)]
*  He's launched an investigation. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=544.1s)]
*  Let's go to Senator Schiff and see what he has to say. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=545.86s)]
*  Senator Schiff, tell us about it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  So today Trump removed many of the tariffs he had imposed in this on again, off again, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=549.34s)]
*  it must be Wednesday tariffs are off again kind of policy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=555.72s)]
*  This has just wreaked havoc on the markets, of course, but there is another profound danger [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  as well, and that is insider trading within the White House, within the administration. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=566.02s)]
*  You may have seen early in the day Trump tweet this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Now this is a good time to buy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=575.7800000000001s)]
*  So the question is between that tweet and Donald Trump's announcement that he was reducing [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=578.12s)]
*  the tariffs on most other nations apart from China. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=583.88s)]
*  The question is, who knew what the president was going to do and did people around the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=587.88s)]
*  president trade stock knowing the incredible gyration the market was about to go through? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=591.82s)]
*  Because look, this is a president who is trading in his own meme coin, even as he's president. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=599.42s)]
*  His kids are trading in their own cryptocurrency. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=604.4s)]
*  We've got people like Elon Musk who are doing their own conflicted self dealing in the administration. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=607.5s)]
*  In any administration this corrupt, it is more than necessary to ask were people personally [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=613.7s)]
*  profiting from insider information while people's savings, their retirement accounts were being [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=620.38s)]
*  torched. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=626.54s)]
*  So we're writing to the White House to demand answers. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=627.96s)]
*  Now I am fully cognizant of the fact that the White House is probably the last place [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=631.5s)]
*  to be forthcoming about this or any other corruption in the administration. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  We in Congress need to do more than demand answers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=640.48s)]
*  We need to do the oversight necessary to get those answers. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  To date, Republicans have not been willing to do this, not when it comes to insider trading [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=647.24s)]
*  potentiality, not when it comes to anything. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=651.94s)]
*  But we have been very fortunate in the minority that so many whistleblowers have come forward [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=656.28s)]
*  with information about corruption in the administration. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=663.28s)]
*  Just a few days ago, I held a hearing with people who had to quit the Justice Department, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=666.88s)]
*  were fired at the Justice Department because they were observing corrupt activity that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=671.88s)]
*  they would not participate in. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  We have tremendously benefited from courageous people coming forward. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  So we invite whistleblowers to step forward. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=684.14s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we're going to get to the bottom of this, whether people [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=687.04s)]
*  were profiting off the pain of the American people. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=690.58s)]
*  chocolate sea salt. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=751.58s)]

*  Next, let's go to Democratic Congress member Stephen Horsforth. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=786.2199999999999s)]
*  Here he grills Donald Trump's top trade representative, Jameson Greer, on Donald Trump's tariff reversal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=791.6199999999999s)]
*  Remember, Jameson Greer spent two days, I'll do a whole other video on this, but he spent [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=798.9s)]
*  two days, first in the Senate, then in the House, saying there will never be a pause. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=803.5s)]
*  And then while Greer was there in the House of Representatives saying there will never [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=808.26s)]
*  be a pause, Trump did a pause on all of the countries other than China and then raised [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=812.78s)]
*  the China tariffs. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=817.14s)]
*  And here was what Representative Stephen Horsforth, a Democratic Congress member, had to say a [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=818.58s)]
*  play this clip. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=823.38s)]
*  There is a trade. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=824.38s)]
*  We already have a free trade agreement. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=826.26s)]
*  We have a trade surplus. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=828.12s)]
*  So getting the least bad, why did they get whacked in the first place? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=829.86s)]
*  We're addressing the $1.2 trillion deficit, the largest in human history that President [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=835.06s)]
*  Biden left us with. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=838.7399999999999s)]
*  We should be running up the score in Australia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=839.7399999999999s)]
*  Ambassador Greer answered the question on Australia. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=841.38s)]
*  They ban our beef and pork. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=844.26s)]
*  We have a trade surplus with Australia. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=845.26s)]
*  We have a free trade agreement. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=847.7399999999999s)]
*  They are an incredibly important national security partner. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=850.2199999999999s)]
*  Why were they whacked with a tariff? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=853.5s)]
*  Senator, despite the agreement, they ban our beef, they ban our pork, they're getting ready [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=855.6199999999999s)]
*  to impose measures on our digital companies. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=860.14s)]
*  With your Greek letter formula, the fact that we have a trade surplus. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=862.46s)]
*  We have a global tariff on every, we're trying to address the $1.2 trillion that Biden left [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=867.4200000000001s)]
*  us with. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=872.34s)]
*  I think that answer, sir, you're a much smarter person than that answer. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=873.34s)]
*  The idea that we are going to whack friend and foe alike, and particularly friends with [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=878.6s)]
*  this level is both, I think, insulting the Australians, undermines our national security [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=885.34s)]
*  and frankly makes us not a good partner going forward. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=890.98s)]
*  The lack of trust from friends and allies based upon this ridiculous policy that goes [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=893.98s)]
*  into full effect at midnight tonight is extraordinary. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=900.3800000000001s)]
*  And here's what Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said, demanding an investigation. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=904.3000000000001s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=908.86s)]
*  And right before Donald Trump declared that some of his tariffs were off again, he sent [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=909.94s)]
*  out a message to his billionaire buddies. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=916.1400000000001s)]
*  He posted, this is a great time to buy in all camps. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=918.1s)]
*  Was that market manipulation? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=924.1800000000001s)]
*  Was it corruption in plain sight? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=925.78s)]
*  We need an independent investigation into market manipulation because Americans need [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=928.46s)]
*  to know whether President Trump or anyone in his administration manipulated the market [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=933.5s)]
*  to benefit their donors all while they are working for the American people. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=940.5s)]
*  And while small businesses and those working families are paying a price. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=945.74s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=952.02s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=953.38s)]
*  Republicans in Congress have a chance to stop him right now. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=954.7s)]
*  If they do nothing, they, along with Trump, are responsible for the fallout. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=961.38s)]
*  So meanwhile, the Trump White House posted the following. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=967.1s)]
*  They have the photo of Donald Trump that looks like the mugshot of him. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=970.42s)]
*  This is actually the White House post after Donald Trump created chaos in the markets, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=975.02s)]
*  said there would never be a pause, and then said there's a pause on all of the countries. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=980.94s)]
*  Although there's not a pause when it comes to the aluminum and steel tariffs, the tariffs [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=984.94s)]
*  on Canada and Mexico. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=990.46s)]
*  And he says he's still going to put tariffs on pharmaceuticals. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=992.14s)]
*  And there's 125% tariffs on China. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=994.78s)]
*  Frankly, people are very confused what the whole situation is. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=996.98s)]
*  But just so you see for yourself, here is multiple clips that even Fox ran with of Trump [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1000.34s)]
*  officials saying there would be no pause. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1007.14s)]
*  Here's Fox with multiple clips of Trump officials saying there would be no pause. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1009.6600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1013.14s)]
*  Now, if I was presenting this case to a jury, one of the things that I would say is a smoking [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1030.34s)]
*  gun is actually what Scott Besant, the Treasury Secretary, said yesterday. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1045.3s)]
*  Here's Besant saying that he and Trump had a long talk on Sunday, and this was the strategy [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1050.1s)]
*  all along. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1055.3s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1056.3s)]
*  He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1061.34s)]
*  You might even say that he goaded China into a bad position. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1069.1s)]
*  They responded. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1075.06s)]
*  They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1076.06s)]
*  And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1080.58s)]
*  retaliate. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a hard message. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1087.8999999999999s)]
*  If we don't retaliate, things will turn out well. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1089.9s)]
*  Now, Scott Besant, the Treasury Secretary, and Caroline Levitt are trying to show, oh, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1092.5400000000002s)]
*  this is the art of the deal. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1098.7800000000002s)]
*  This shows how smart Trump is. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1100.5400000000002s)]
*  This was all part of three-dimensional chess. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1102.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, if they're saying that this was the plan all along, so their plan all along was [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1105.5400000000002s)]
*  to deceive the American people, deceive American corporations, cause American corporations [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1112.9s)]
*  chaos. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1120.42s)]
*  What if in reliance, American corporations were building, said, okay, well, I guess we [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1121.42s)]
*  ought to move factories, change supply chains. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1126.14s)]
*  So that was all part of the plan. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1129.1000000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to tell it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1130.26s)]
*  They created this chaos, destroyed tons of businesses that are going to feel the effects [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1131.6200000000001s)]
*  of this. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1136.8600000000001s)]
*  Small businesses, medium-sized businesses, businesses in general, they don't have the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1137.8600000000001s)]
*  luxury to go, oops, I guess it's not a tariff. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1140.5800000000002s)]
*  I guess it's tariff. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1142.82s)]
*  So that was the plan all along, but that was kept secret to destroy wealth, to erase $10 [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1144.34s)]
*  trillion from the markets, to wipe out $10 trillion in the markets, wipe it out, erase [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1149.82s)]
*  it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1155.86s)]

*  because they were terrified. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1161.1799999999998s)]
*  This was the plan. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  And then a massive transfer of wealth. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1165.1799999999998s)]

*  Excuse me. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1174.56s)]
*  If I, excuse me, recall, if I could just add to what the secretary said, many of you in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1175.56s)]
*  the media clearly missed the art of the deal. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1179.64s)]

*  You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China when in fact [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1186.28s)]
*  we've seen the opposite effect. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1190.68s)]
*  The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1192.28s)]
*  markets. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  They need our consumers and they need this president in the Oval Office to talk to them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1197.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly why more than 75 countries have called because the United States of America [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1202.8000000000002s)]

*  And as the president has shown great courage, as the secretary has said, in choosing to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgGJUP_MI4&t=1209.0400000000002s)]
