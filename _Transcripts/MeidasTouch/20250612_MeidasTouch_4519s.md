Video Description: On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: The Trump regime arrests a sitting U.S. Senator in a shocking display of authoritarian overreach at a DHS press conference. Trump torpedoes his own immigration policy, lies about the situation in Los Angeles, and unleashes tanks in D.C. for a grotesque military spectacle. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom continues to lead the charge against Trump’s escalating abuses of power. We break down the collapse of Trump’s poll numbers, his latest surrender in the trade war, the GOP’s humiliating congressional hearings, and more from another chaotic week under an unraveling regime. Ben, Brett and Jordy discuss it all.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 6/12/25
**MeidasTouch:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8)
*  Welcome to the Midas Touch podcast. I'm Ben Mycelis, joined by Brett and Jordi Mycelis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, the authoritarian Trump regime detained a sitting United States Senator in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=6.16s)]
*  California at the Los Angeles FBI office because he showed up to ask a question of the Department [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=12.16s)]
*  of Homeland Security Secretary Cosplay dog killer Kristi Noem as she was giving a speech in Los [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=18.96s)]
*  Angeles talking about liberating the city of Los Angeles. So the Trump regime has now arrested or [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=25.12s)]
*  detained a sitting United States Senator, a sitting criminal judge in Wisconsin, a mayor from New [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=31.92s)]
*  Jersey, a congresswoman, a labor leader. They have deployed the Marines into Los Angeles. There are [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=39.44s)]
*  more federalized National Guard troops in LA and Marines than there are of our troops in Iraq, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=47.76s)]
*  Syria, or anywhere in the Middle East, or anywhere in the Middle East at this point. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=57.92s)]
*  This is what fascism absolutely looks like. And then we have tanks rolling into Washington, DC [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=63.84s)]
*  for Donald Trump's dictator parade, military parade on Saturday. The Midas Touch network is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=70.88s)]
*  the main news distributor for the No Kings protest that will be taking place on Saturday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=77.6s)]
*  Over 2,000 protests scheduled across the country and the world. We'd love for you to be out there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=86.0s)]
*  peacefully protesting, of course, on Saturday for the No Kings protest. But let's break this all down [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=92.08s)]
*  of what took place. So you had Kristi Noem in Los Angeles delivering a speech at the FBI office in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=97.68s)]
*  downtown Los Angeles, like a coup leader of like a banana, like taking over a banana republic. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=106.24s)]
*  So her speech was basically, I am here. There is a new government in town, the Trump regime. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=113.52s)]
*  We are here to liberate Los Angeles from your communist political leaders. The liberation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  is going down now. Me and our troops are here to stay. This is exactly the kind of speech you see [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=129.04s)]
*  during a coup by coup leaders in like banana republics. Watch what Kristi Noem said. And then [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  you'll see towards the end of this clip, California Senator Alex Padilla, he's kind of in the corner [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=143.6s)]
*  and he's trying to ask a question as she talks about liberating the city from what? From itself [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  with Marines? What the hell are we talking about? Here, play this clip. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=155.92s)]
*  Stain and increase our operations in this city. We are not going away. We are staying here to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=159.04s)]
*  liberate the city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=172.88s)]
*  So I want to say thank you to every single person that has been able to do this. Also, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=178.48s)]
*  I want to talk. We'll show you the attack in just a moment as well. She said liberate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=185.12s)]
*  the city of Los Angeles, but that has been the language coming from Donald Trump that he's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=192.08s)]
*  sending the Marines. He's sending military forces against citizens of the United States, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=196.96s)]
*  against migrants living in the United States to have a military operation to take over [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=206.0s)]
*  a state, the state that's the largest GDP in the country, the fourth largest GDP in the entire [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=214.88s)]
*  world if California was a country. And so Trump gave the dictator speech before the 82nd Airborne [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=221.84s)]
*  Division at Fort Bragg. He handpicked also the army members who were behind him. They had to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=230.64s)]
*  follow a political test. I'll talk about that in a little bit. But in front of our soldiers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  in a politicized speech, Donald Trump talks about liberating, liberation of an American state. Here, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=243.76s)]
*  play this clip. But I'll say it loudly and clearly. They better do something before it's too late. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=252.56s)]
*  Very simply, we will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=259.04s)]
*  It's happening very quickly. That would be the type of speech you would hear of a dictator [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=263.36s)]
*  taking over another country. So the language that's being used, it would be an understatement to call [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=270.56s)]
*  it provocative and escalating. That would be an understatement. As tanks are rolling into Los [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=278.16s)]
*  Ames and military equipment and tank-like vehicles rolling into California with the tanks that are [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=285.76s)]
*  rolling into Washington, D.C. for Trump's dictator parade, even though I think it was [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=293.2s)]
*  Nathan Hockman, the district attorney in Los Angeles, who said in terms of anybody who's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  engaged in criminal conduct, it's been about maybe 400 people in all of Los Angeles, which is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=307.68s)]
*  0.003 of the entire population in LA of people who have actually engaged in any form of crimes, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=315.12s)]
*  which of course we condemn here in a small area in downtown LA that Trump is calling the National [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=327.12s)]
*  Guard, federalizing it and the Marines because he's trying to provoke a situation. Now, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=334.24s)]
*  I want to share with you what it looked like when a sitting United States Senator, Alex Padilla, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  whose job is oversight of the federal government, he has every right to be there to ask a question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=346.72s)]
*  I want to show you what the Gestapo, what Trump's Gestapo, what Trump's brown shirts, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=354.24s)]
*  who are wearing FBI jackets, because that's what they are, let's just call it out, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=360.16s)]
*  what they did to Padilla here, play this clip. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=364.08s)]
*  On the ground, on the ground, hands on your back, hands on your back. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=394.08s)]
*  So you can see him on the floor here and they are putting him in handcuffs after forcibly [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=413.76s)]
*  removing the Senator. Now they're going to Alex Padilla's staff and telling them to stop [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=418.64s)]
*  recording, maybe not want them to see what is going on here. So then you have cosplay dog killer [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=430.24s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem then goes on Fox to push the narrative that she was a victim, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=438.64s)]
*  that Padilla was there to basically attack her and threaten her, right? The Trump regime, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=446.88s)]
*  they're always the victims. And that as soon as Padilla identified that he was a United States [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=452.64s)]
*  Senator, because she didn't know what she says, and that none of the FBI officials knew one of two [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=459.36s)]
*  United States Senators, like literally the top federal officer positions in California, that they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=464.48s)]
*  then stopped what they were doing and then did not detain and did not handcuff him. We saw it on [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=470.72s)]
*  tape here, play this clip. Secretary. Well, he was never arrested. He was never arrested and he, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  nobody knew who he was when he came into the room creating a scene. He was removed from the room. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  And yes, they started to put handcuffs on him when he finally identified himself. And then that was [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=488.56s)]
*  stopped. And we then I, he, they said he wants to talk to us. Sure. I'd love to sit down and visit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=493.36s)]
*  So you saw it with your own eyes. It did not then stop. They then threw him in the hallway, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=499.44s)]
*  threw him on the ground. And if they do that to a United States Senator, if they've done that to a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=507.52s)]
*  Congresswoman, to a sitting criminal state court judge, what do you think they're doing to the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=513.36s)]
*  rest of us? What do you think they're doing to the rest of us? I mean, by the way, you have the ice [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=520.24s)]
*  raids going after farmers, ice. We see the helicopters that are usually used for like [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=526.08s)]
*  narcotics operations, tracking the farm workers as they send ice agents to chase people working [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=532.96s)]
*  in the farms down and tackle them on the floor. The ice raids of factories and in restaurants [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=540.88s)]
*  here in California and across the country, people waiting in bushes, ice agents waiting in bushes [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  as people are pursuing their lawful process, ice agents looking at people. And if their skin [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=553.68s)]
*  is a certain color, they'll ram their cars into you. Literally ram their cars into you. Like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  American citizens with kids in the back, throw you out onto the street, leave your car trashed, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=567.04s)]
*  and then just basically drive away. That's why we're in an authoritarian regime right now, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  an idiotic one, but a dangerous authoritarian regime. By the way, there are those FIFA games [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=578.88s)]
*  in Miami right now, and ICE has already announced and Customs and Border Patrol that they're going [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=584.72s)]
*  to be basically the security guards at all the FIFA events in the United States, also for the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=592.24s)]
*  World Cup. And already they've been going to the soccer events, checking people's papers, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=597.28s)]
*  the people who are competing in like FIFA events right now, like that's taking place [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=603.04s)]
*  in a place where the Republican mayor of Miami was there. If they're doing there, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  where do you think they're doing it? With the head of FIFA right there. So then you have [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson, he's just out there. Well, it was the senator who provoked this and then Fox pushes [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=617.36s)]
*  the attack from the senator. The senator gone after her. The Trump regime is under attack. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=625.76s)]
*  LA is all burning down. It's all fall. This is worse than the propaganda in North Korea, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=630.56s)]
*  in Russia. Here, watch. This is MAGA Mike Johnson. Let's watch this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=639.52s)]
*  We'll get the sound on that in a little bit. But while this is all going on, you've got MAGA [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  Republican. I just want to show you what's going on in the hearings today, right? As all these [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  MAGA Republicans are kind of mimicking Trump's authoritarianism. Basically, what these hearings [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=659.12s)]
*  are now are Republicans, like they'll call in Democratic governors, like that's who was subpoenaed [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=665.68s)]
*  today. And then because there's like no more rules, no more decorum, no more law, like United States [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=671.92s)]
*  is because of Trump, any type of like decency, all out the window, all flushed in Trump's turd of a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  toilet, orange turd of a toilet bowl. So you've got MAGA Republican James Comer, like they'll just [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=686.48s)]
*  start yelling at the other congressmen, shut up, you shut up. And then they'll have like Marjorie [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=691.76s)]
*  Callaghan go, you're Antifa, you're Antifa. Because Democratic Congress member Frost was trying to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=696.16s)]
*  ask a question. And this is how the Republican Congress members behave. Here, watch this. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=700.96s)]
*  No, you don't know. You're not going to tell me to shut up. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=708.0s)]
*  Let's, how do you get him in order? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=710.08s)]
*  You're running for the- [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=712.72s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=713.6s)]
*  He's, he has been out of order six times. He's trying to get on MSNBC. You've probably knocked- [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=719.6s)]
*  Somebody off of MSNBC to get on there. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=720.32s)]
*  I think he's been arrested as a former Antifa member, right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=722.48s)]
*  Back to order, Ms. Green. Go. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=727.12s)]
*  He's a former Antifa member. Mr. Chairman, I'm surprised. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=728.64s)]
*  Who's a former Antifa member? Me? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=734.72s)]
*  I ask that these words be taken down. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  Then you have Marjorie Taylor Green questioning Democratic Governor Kathy Hockel, not questioning [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=737.28s)]
*  her. It's supposed to be questions, but calling her there so she can say, you need to be arrested [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=744.88s)]
*  right now. We're putting you in prison. We're throwing you in jail. Watch. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=750.48s)]
*  You are responsible for the murder of this little girl, Lakin Riley. And the Department of Justice [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  should prosecute you for her murder. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=763.12s)]
*  Objection. Objection. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't care how much you object, and if you support it too, you're responsible for her murder. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=767.12s)]
*  I yield now, Mr. Chairman. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=772.8s)]
*  On a point of order. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=774.4s)]
*  On a point of order. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=775.36s)]
*  The lady's time has expired. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=776.48s)]
*  Stage point. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=777.84s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, these witnesses have been here for over four hours. They've all voluntarily [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=779.04s)]
*  have been engaging with our members with respect. They've all treated our members with respect. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=783.6s)]
*  Lakin Riley is dead forever. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=788.96s)]
*  I rule the day come. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=791.36s)]
*  Forever. They can sit there all day. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=792.96s)]
*  I rule the day come, claiming my time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=794.64s)]
*  Hold on. No, state your point. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=795.84s)]
*  I'm trying to. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=798.88s)]
*  State your point. No, no. It's a point of inquiry. Not a debate. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=799.52s)]
*  Our rules, if you would let me speak, our rules of decorum dictate that our witnesses should be [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=803.44s)]
*  treated with respect, and I ask you to enforce decorum and remind committee members to treat [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=810.08s)]
*  our witnesses with respect. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  Our members are treated with respect. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=817.12s)]
*  So is it any shock to you right now that when you look at Donald Trump's approval, whether [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=820.48s)]
*  you're looking at the Quinnipiac poll, his approval is 38%, 54% of Americans disapprove, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=826.0s)]
*  whether it's Trump's disastrous bill, 53% oppose, 27% support, whether it's Trump's handling of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=833.36s)]
*  immigration, 54% disapprove, 43% approve. Remember for the past weeks where you had CNN and Fox [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=841.36s)]
*  and all of these networks trying to say, oh, you know, this is very popular. Trump's immigration. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=850.32s)]
*  This is why he's going in. What a brilliant political strategist. Remember, they were all [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=857.6s)]
*  saying that on corporate news. Then pull up, Brett, the AP NORC, the AP NORC poll right there, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=862.24s)]
*  which similarly has Donald Trump significantly underwater. 60% of Americans disapprove of Trump, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=868.32s)]
*  39% approve of Donald Trump. UGov has similar results. Trump is the least popular ever, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=875.76s)]
*  basically, in the history of the presidency at this time. And Brett and Jordi, I know that was a long [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=882.72s)]
*  buildup right there, but I think you have to make all of those connections with Trump speaking [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=887.92s)]
*  before the Army, before the 82nd Airborne Division, having the Army brass politically vet to make sure [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=894.72s)]
*  they're Trump supporters. By the way, they called in for that event, Trump MAGA vendors who were [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=906.88s)]
*  selling to the troops Trump white privilege cards. They were given white privilege Trump's everything [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=913.76s)]
*  cards and MAGA hats there. And they were booing Gavin. Trump would have them boo Gavin Newsom and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=922.8s)]
*  boo the fake news, as Donald Trump would say, fake news. So anyway, no one wants to travel to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  the United States right now. Yeah, why would you come here? It's incredibly dangerous for somebody [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  to come here. I mean, it's dangerous for citizens. Why would a non-citizen want to travel here? No, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=942.4799999999999s)]
*  I think it was important, Ben, that you set it up like that. And the thing you said at the very end [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=947.12s)]
*  there, I think is almost the most important because we see all this craziness happening and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=950.64s)]
*  it's all horrifying. I don't want to diminish any of that. But the idea that Donald Trump is [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=956.16s)]
*  politicizing the military in the way he's doing to me is the most horrifying thing. I know Ron [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=960.96s)]
*  Filipkowski, the Midas Touch editor in chief, has spoken about this at length, how Donald Trump has [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=966.16s)]
*  in the past few days turned these military events into Trump rallies, how he's turning [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=971.12s)]
*  this military parade for the 250th anniversary into a Trump rally, how he got people to [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=976.0s)]
*  kind of boo and laugh at and mock Gavin Newsom at the rally, how he played his songs at the, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=983.04s)]
*  you know, like a rally when he was with the military, how he vetted the military. There was [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=989.52s)]
*  a story that came out that said Donald Trump vetted the members of the military who were able to sit [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=993.68s)]
*  behind him in order to make sure that they were ideologically aligned with him politically. And if [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=998.0s)]
*  they were not Trump supporters, they were told that they had to report to their superiors and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1003.44s)]
*  tell their superiors, I do not support these politics, I do not support Donald Trump. And [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  then they were not allowed to participate in the event. That is not what happens in the United [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  States of America, but that is what happens under autocratic regimes. And that's what we are seeing [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1016.4000000000001s)]
*  right now in the United States of America. And this is Donald Trump's go-to strategy that we've [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1020.6400000000001s)]
*  seen time and time again. You see, let's just go back for a second. Let's like the first few that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1025.52s)]
*  come to mind, because we see right now LA, you know, what's the excuse that Donald Trump is using [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1032.0s)]
*  right now to have ICE and have the National Guard and the Marines essentially invade Los Angeles? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1036.88s)]
*  He's saying Los Angeles is dangerous, it's burning to the ground, I'm the only person who could save [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1043.84s)]
*  it. The city is an apocalypse right now, it is just beyond repair, I need to come in and I need [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1049.68s)]
*  to fix it. We need regime change in Los Angeles, is essentially what he's saying. Not too different [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1057.76s)]
*  than the lies that he made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating cats and dogs. Not [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1062.48s)]
*  too different than the lies he told about Aurora, Colorado when he was running, when he said that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1067.52s)]
*  Aurora was invaded and it was under siege. Not too different than what Republicans have always done [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1071.6s)]
*  when they say there's a caravan and the caravan is coming to get you and they're going to kill you [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1076.0s)]
*  once they cross that border, so you better elect Republicans in the midterms because this caravan [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1080.32s)]
*  is going to come. And meanwhile, at the end of any midterm, once the election ends, polls close, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1084.72s)]
*  boom, caravan disappears, you never see that on Fox News anymore. Interesting how that happens, huh? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I need you to understand as well that this cannot happen without people who are [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  complicit in it. Donald Trump may be the engine behind this, but everybody around him right now [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1102.08s)]
*  are all equally, if not even more, to blame. And I would say probably even more to blame. What [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1109.44s)]
*  people are seeing when they turn into Fox News, for example, is a complete alternate universe, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1114.56s)]
*  a complete alternate reality that does not reflect what is actually happening. They are simply shown [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1121.12s)]
*  images of things burning in LA. People watching Fox are made to believe that LA is the apocalypse [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  right now. Oh, it's like that North Korea, South Korea approach, right? South Korea is far too [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  dangerous. You don't want to go to South Korea. We will keep you safe here. That's what they do in [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1137.12s)]
*  autocratic regimes all across the world. That's what Fox is doing. You don't want to go there. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1141.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, LA, California, actually some of the safer places in the country. And let's see if I [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1145.04s)]
*  could pull this up. I pulled it up before. Let me see if I could find it. But I bring receipts, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1150.4s)]
*  so I bring some data here. And if you look at the top 10 US states by homicide rate per capita, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1154.4s)]
*  and the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is what Trump and Republicans are using as [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  an excuse in order to have the military invade Los Angeles. Mississippi, number one, Louisiana, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  number two, Alabama, number three, New Mexico, number four, South Carolina, number five, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1170.56s)]
*  Missouri, number six. And I could go on and on and on. California is like number 30, by the way, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1177.28s)]
*  on this list. Just want to give you a little bit of some context that we're going through. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1183.28s)]
*  And you just see this complete denial of reality from everybody at this point. You see the denial [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1188.72s)]
*  of reality from all these MAGA influencers, including from this right-wing media. You even [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1194.32s)]
*  have regular corporate media normalizing this stuff and acting like what Trump's saying is true, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1198.56s)]
*  which is even more disturbing, even just the headlines they use about riots and everything. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1203.36s)]
*  There was no issues in Los Angeles before Donald Trump got here. Even after Trump got here, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1207.84s)]
*  the issues were very minimal and very contained. And he still continues to use that as an excuse [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1212.48s)]
*  and use this dangerous language. And the Department of Homeland Security continues to use this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1217.44s)]
*  language. And you're in a world right now where even the most obvious lies are the ones where [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  Republicans are going all behind. This is how you know that it's complete and total cult. Trump [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1227.68s)]
*  yesterday, he said, I spoke to Gavin Newsom yesterday about this. See, that was a comment [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1233.44s)]
*  that Trump made. And then every MAGA influencer and Fox host started saying Trump spoke to Gavin [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1237.52s)]
*  Newsom yesterday. Gavin Newsom said, I didn't speak to Trump yesterday. I told you when I spoke to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1242.96s)]
*  Trump. It was June 7th. And then a Fox host gets a hold of Donald Trump's call logs, which actually [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1247.68s)]
*  proves Gavin Newsom right and shows that he spoke to Donald Trump on June 7th. Yet Fox and all these [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1253.44s)]
*  MAGA influencers were going, see, I told you Newsom lied, Newsom lied. He was actually, they actually [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1259.68s)]
*  spoke yesterday. If you can't just admit that yesterday was not June 7th, then how could we [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1265.68s)]
*  agree on anything else? If you can't admit on something as black and white as what the day is, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  what the day is, then we're not going to get anywhere in this country on anything else. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  And then I'm not, I just can't take you seriously on anything, but it shows you how nefarious they [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1279.6799999999998s)]
*  are. It shows you how evil they are, how they're willing to just lie about absolutely evil. And [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1284.0s)]
*  then when Fox plays these clips, they literally edit out words. So they'll edit out the word where [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1289.52s)]
*  Trump says, I spoke to Gavin Newsom yesterday. They literally edit out the word yesterday. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1294.32s)]
*  And they go see Newsom lied. And this is how they do it. And then they get their sheeple who are [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  watching these channels to repeat, Newsom's the liar. Newsom's the liar. No, you're being lied to. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1303.36s)]
*  You are the sheep. You see, Christie, no, no, we didn't know who Alex Padilla was. He didn't [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1308.8s)]
*  identify himself. We have no idea who that was. The first thing he says in that clip is I'm Senator [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1313.84s)]
*  Alex Padilla. I'm Senator Alex Padilla. It doesn't get much clearer than that. And as you continue [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1319.92s)]
*  to watch all these people around Donald Trump too, Ben, Ben, you said this best, all of them are kind [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1326.64s)]
*  of molding themselves right now in the image of Donald Trump. Just a complete scumbag, excuse my [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1331.36s)]
*  language. But you see Caroline Levitt when she's asked a question, because Donald Trump said that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1337.44s)]
*  there was going to be, what did he say? A heavy force used against protesters this weekend. Don't [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1342.4s)]
*  let him scare you, by the way. He said there'd be heavy force used against protesters. What did [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1347.92s)]
*  Caroline Levitt say? She goes, shut up. That's a stupid question. Shut up. Stupid question. Caroline [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1351.6000000000001s)]
*  Levitt said that. Like, how dare you? Who the hell do you think you are? You work for us. Like, this [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1356.48s)]
*  is absolutely insane that we're seeing that sort of stuff in this government. And today, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1361.2s)]
*  Kristi Noem, you know, I said, dude, in every word, I mean, it's just time after time, we continue to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1366.3999999999999s)]
*  get just this gaslighting, this nastiness. And it's just spread right now. And it's not a two-party [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1370.8s)]
*  issue. This is all coming from one side. It's all coming from one person. And it's just totally [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1377.2s)]
*  become toxic in our politics. But when people say, oh, I hate politics, everybody's sick. Not really, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1383.52s)]
*  though. Like, this is kind of coming from one side right now. And we have to call it out. And we have [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1388.56s)]
*  to remain focused on calling out that side. Jordi, sorry. No, 1,000%. I mean, it's gaslighting 101. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1392.32s)]
*  First of all, I just want to start here. The military-style parade this weekend, it's going [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1398.48s)]
*  to go down as one of the biggest stains on this country's history. What are we, North Korea? We, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  Russia? We don't do that stuff here. And to flaunt it in such a way on dear leader's birthday, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1408.08s)]
*  having this military-style parade. I mean, what's more disgusting and dystopian than that? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1414.8s)]
*  And then back to Kristi Noem, Brett. The gaslighting 101. What does she do? She runs [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1419.92s)]
*  to Fox News and just starts writing the talking points for folks to run with on the right. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1425.76s)]
*  And Kristi Noem, and to your point, Brett, this entire MAGA ilk have cloned themselves in the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  vision of Donald Trump. Kristi Noem, she gets the MAGA makeover. We all know that she didn't, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1439.28s)]
*  she had the short haircut and now she has these extensions or whatever and goes into MAGAVIL and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1445.2s)]
*  just has the Mar-a-Lago makeover, as they call it. It's absolutely disgusting what we're seeing here. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1451.76s)]
*  And it's gross from a human level because what they do is they just become pathological liars. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1457.92s)]
*  The truth, it doesn't matter to them. They want to go on Fox News and rewrite history in live time. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1463.76s)]
*  And then lastly, the congressional Republicans. I mean, these are the dumbest people of all time. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1470.56s)]
*  You got James Comer up there, you got Marjorie Taylor Greene up there. What do they even talk? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1477.36s)]
*  They're telling Frost he's Antifa and he was arrested because he's Antifa. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1483.28s)]
*  Their reality TV want to be quote unquote celebrities that have very serious positions. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1487.6s)]
*  And I just wish we had our politics into a place where they're not the ones who are leading the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1494.72s)]
*  charge and making laws and signing off on XYZ issues that impact the American people at such [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1500.4s)]
*  a granular human level because you clearly can tell from those clips that they don't give a damn. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1506.88s)]
*  They don't give a damn about the American people. What we're seeing is actually exactly what they [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1513.2800000000002s)]
*  accuse Frost of on that clip. They go, you just want to show up on MSNBC? No, you dunces. You just [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1519.44s)]
*  want to show up on Fox News and you just want to be celebrated and applauded on Fox News because [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1525.2s)]
*  you guys don't give a damn about your job or the American people. You want to make a name for [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1529.76s)]
*  yourself and fundraise off of Antifa and the scary leftist person. You guys are so frigging stupid, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1534.72s)]
*  man. It actually, it makes my blood boil watching them speak. You know the image. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1541.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to be watching the tanks go into DC. He's going to be watching the soldiers [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1547.68s)]
*  march the way it looks in Russia, the way it looks in North Korea. Donald Trump's going to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1554.56s)]
*  do that thing that he does with his head where he goes on the balcony and does the Mussolini look [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1560.48s)]
*  and he's going to give that dictator look. That's the image that he wants. When we come back, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to repeat what California Governor Gavin Newsom said, that that is weakness [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1573.04s)]
*  masquerading as strength, that it's weakness masquerading as strength. There's nothing strong [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1579.2800000000002s)]
*  about that. All of the international leaders are looking at that and seeing that he's weak and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1584.96s)]
*  pathetic and they are taking advantage of the United States and picking the United States apart [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1590.3200000000002s)]
*  like never before in a way that makes my dogs even upset. That's how upset they make it. I want to [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1598.3200000000002s)]
*  remind everybody as well that we just launched a new feature on the Midas Touch YouTube channel [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1604.4s)]
*  where I'm doing a series called Ask the Editor with our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski. It is [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1611.2s)]
*  a members only feature. So everyone who's got those memberships on YouTube where you get those [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1616.72s)]

*  because I think you see how important it is that we continue to expand here in the United States [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1651.04s)]
*  and internationally. So it's easy to become a member on our YouTube channel. You get the emojis [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1655.84s)]

*  can't do it. Just spread the word about this channel. Also, let's try to get to 5 million [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1664.32s)]

*  weakness masquerading as strength. And I want to show how California Governor Gavin Newsom stood up, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1679.76s)]
*  met the moment and fought back against the Trump regime. Let's take our first quick break of the [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1686.32s)]
*  show. Look, I'm going to be honest. I love soda and I've loved soda my whole life, well into my [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  twenties and my early thirties. And with all that sugar though, I just know the compounding effect. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1698.56s)]
*  Well, I needed to try something different. Alipop is a new kind of soda that provides the classic [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1702.72s)]
*  soda taste with the health benefits of functional ingredient blend to support digestive health. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1708.24s)]
*  Alipop is reimagining soda with high fiber and only two to five grams of sugar per can. Alipop [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1713.6s)]
*  is sold online and available in almost 50,000 retailers nationwide. Almost every American has [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  some sort of relationship with soda from their childhood or their adulthood. Some people grew up [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  drinking it all the time and then quit. And some people are still addicted to it like me and are [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1731.36s)]
*  trying to quit. Alipop uses functional ingredient blend to support digestive health. Alipop offers [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1736.1599999999999s)]

*  daily recommended added sugar intake of 30 grams. Sweden beverages like soda are the leading source [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1753.28s)]
*  of added sugars in the American diet. Alipop is much, much lower in sugar than conventional sodas [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1759.44s)]
*  with only two to five grams of sugar from natural sources. There's no added sugar. Their vintage [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1766.72s)]

*  Weakness masquerading as strength. That's what California Governor Gavin Newsom said to me [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1939.9199999999998s)]
*  when I had the honor of interviewing him earlier in the week. Also, Gavin Newsom gave that address [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1946.4799999999998s)]
*  to the state of California and the nation and Midas Touch Network got the exclusive stream. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1952.3999999999999s)]
*  We had 150,000 concurrent viewers. That was a new record for our stream. I think that will only get [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1958.8s)]
*  higher over the coming weeks, months, and years. Also, Gavin Newsom, I thought was, we did about [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1966.08s)]
*  1.7 million, 1.8 million views in about 24 hours to 48 hours and it's still rising. I think Gavin [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1975.4399999999998s)]
*  Newsom, going back to that, is really giving the template of how you have to fight back right now [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1984.32s)]
*  in 2025 against the Trump regime. I think Gavin Newsom really learned it and saw what Biden was [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  dealing with, but Biden was an old school guy. Biden was, let's bring people together. Let's be [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=1997.76s)]

*  troll. We're above this. America's better than it, damn it. That was Biden's approach and we saw [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2011.12s)]
*  how Trump and MAGA exploited it. MAGA, Trump, they have a right-wing influencer army funded by [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2017.12s)]
*  right-wing fascist billionaires who pour a ton of money into it and we also know that Russia was [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2026.6399999999999s)]
*  using France to fund a lot of right-wing influencers as well. You don't really even [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2033.36s)]
*  hear a peep about that, but we'll still bring that up here on the Midas Touch Network. By the way, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2039.44s)]
*  it's why I think it's an important fact that we're an independent media network at the Midas Touch [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2044.56s)]
*  Network and why we also make sure we say to all of you, if you can, please try to become a member. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2049.6s)]

*  That's a super, super helpful way of going about it. Let me talk about weakness masquerading as [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2067.84s)]
*  strength and let me first talk about how there are so many countries that just see it. You know how [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2074.1600000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump's bragging about China and Trump's posting, great deal with China, great deal. He [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2083.36s)]
*  goes, great deal, exclamation point. Great deal. You didn't do a deal and maybe Fox will repost that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2089.6800000000003s)]
*  and maybe your magma mush brain, whatever watches Fox, a million people an episode, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2096.72s)]
*  a million and a half. By the way, more people watch the Midas Touch Network and Fox. Maybe you [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2101.8399999999997s)]
*  get that by your audience, but you're not tricking the rest of the world who you actually have to [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2106.64s)]
*  make deals with. On, what was it, around May 12th, they entered into a consensus with China. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2111.52s)]
*  Trump sent Treasury Secretary Scott Vesnt and trade representative, Jameson Greer to [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2118.56s)]
*  Switzerland and the United States caved. It's not a deal. China called it a consensus and the U.S. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2126.08s)]
*  dropped its tariffs against China from 145% to about what, 35%ish, 33%. So the U.S. was taxing [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2132.08s)]
*  itself 35% on the imports coming in from China and China dropped it to 10%. So China was taxing [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2140.4s)]
*  its own people 10%. China had still cut off the rare earth minerals being sent into the United [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2146.96s)]
*  States. And so the United States companies rushed to Trump and they were like, dude, we're all about [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2154.96s)]
*  to lose our businesses. All of the technology requires these rare earth minerals. You got to [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2161.04s)]
*  do something, you know. So then Trump sends Treasury Secretary Vesnt and Commerce Secretary [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2165.6s)]
*  Howard Nutlick or Lutnik, whatever his last name is. They then go to London and then they announce, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2171.6s)]
*  we've done it again. We did it twice. What'd you do? They claim it was a deal, but when you read it, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2177.04s)]
*  it was a framework to implement the consensus. And then there was a time limit on it for six months [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2182.56s)]
*  that was set by China. China was putting a deadline on us. China's like, look, we'll give you the rare [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2191.44s)]
*  earth minerals for six more months. And then Trump's like, victory. And then Trump announces [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2198.64s)]
*  that the tariffs will now be 55% because Trump thinks 55% is a bigger number than 35%. So that's [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2204.72s)]
*  a win, but we're taxing American importers passed on to American consumers now. 55%, not the 33 or [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2211.84s)]
*  35%. And China's deal is 10%. And Trump thinks that's a good deal. Before Trump's trade war [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2220.1600000000003s)]
*  against the world, United States was trading with China. We were getting the rare earth minerals. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2226.96s)]
*  So now Trump's idea of a great deal is not a deal. It's a consensus where the US cave from [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2234.48s)]
*  145% tariffs to 55% tariffs and a six month deadline on receiving rare earth minerals, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2241.44s)]
*  when none of those problems existed before Trump did a trade war against the world and they post [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2249.28s)]
*  great deal. Like if you think that that's actually a great deal, I've got something to sell you. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2255.68s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump does. He literally says, I've got something to sell you. You want [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2262.16s)]
*  the Trump card? Because Trump, while all of this is going on, while we're also on the precipice of [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2266.24s)]
*  a war where Israel's apparently going to attack Iran, Iran's revolutionary guard is ready to attack [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  US military bases in Iraq and elsewhere. So the US had to evacuate everybody from the Middle East. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2279.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was attending the play of Les Mis where he was getting mostly booed but [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2286.8799999999997s)]
*  clapped on the red carpet. And when he was asked about what was going on in Iran, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2294.64s)]
*  Donald Trump says, it's pretty dangerous. It's a dangerous situation. I don't really know. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2299.6s)]
*  Dangerous place. Who knows what's going to be on it? And then they asked him if he's seen Les Mis [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  before. And he shook his head yes, and he obviously hadn't. And they go, are you more like Javert or [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2309.92s)]
*  are you, what's the other character? Jean Vigeon? And Trump's like, which one are you more, the good [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2317.04s)]
*  guy or the bad guy? And Trump's like, it's a tough question. I'm probably like both of them. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2325.52s)]
*  And do you know the plot of Les Mis also? Because it's like literally fighting back against an [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2332.08s)]
*  authoritarian regime, which maybe that was Melania's self-troll against Donald Trump. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2338.88s)]
*  But let me go back to another example though, because that's one example of weakness masquerading [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  as strength. So now the message that's being sent to every other country in Asia and around the [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2350.08s)]
*  world, Europe, elsewhere, you just give Donald Trump a press release and then you literally [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  take everything from the United States. All of the deals, you can never get to exploit the US [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  when the US was actually had real qualified people and tough negotiators. You can now get [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  its open season, go after it. China's flexing its military muscle in the oceans around Asia, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2370.8s)]
*  by Australia, without any deterrence. It is open season because the US looks utterly weak and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2378.32s)]
*  pathetic. That's how it looks like to the world. You have Germany, you have Canada and other [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2385.6000000000004s)]
*  countries in Europe talking about building up their militaries now. Japan wants to build up [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2392.0s)]
*  its military because everyone views the United States as incredibly weak. And then another [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2397.44s)]
*  weakness masquerading as strength, just what's happening here domestically. So rather than stand [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2405.12s)]
*  up for the United States interest in the Middle East and actually project strength or project [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2411.36s)]
*  strength to China, Donald Trump decides he's going to attack inside the United States? Where am I [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2416.48s)]
*  going to send the military? I'm going to send it inside the United States. That, by the way, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2423.68s)]
*  is why when Donald Trump says 51st state to Canada, it's not a joke. He literally wants to [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2428.3199999999997s)]
*  send the Marines and the 82nd Airborne Division into Canada. That's actually what the guy wants [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2434.48s)]
*  to do. And then when it comes to Greenland, they have military plans drawn up to invade [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2441.52s)]
*  a territory of our ally, Denmark, which is a member of the European Union and a member of NATO, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2449.8399999999997s)]
*  which would trigger Article 7 against the United States. And so you had a [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2457.6s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress member who used to be more centrist. This guy, Congress member Mike Turner, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2463.68s)]
*  he's asking Pete Hegseth in a hearing today, just to be clear, you don't have war plans ready to [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2469.2s)]
*  invade Greenland. And he can't deny it because they have war plans to invade Greenland. Watch this. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2476.88s)]
*  Lawyer here, I just want to help you out because people try to twist your words. You are not [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  confirming in your testimony today that at the Pentagon there are plans for invading or taking [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2494.56s)]
*  by force Greenland, correct? That is not your testimony today. All my testimony is that the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2503.28s)]
*  Pentagon has plans for any number of contingencies. It is not your testimony today that there are [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2509.28s)]
*  plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct? Because I sure as [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2513.76s)]
*  hell hope that that is not your testimony. We look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2519.76s)]
*  it is secured from any potential threats. Excellent. I'll get back. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2524.6400000000003s)]
*  Weakness masquerading as strength. A former Fox host as the Secretary of Defense, weakness [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2533.28s)]
*  masquerading as strength. Donald Trump at Fort Bragg before the 82nd Air Force, Airborne Division, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2543.1200000000003s)]
*  attacking Gavin Newsom. Here, play this clip. Weakness masquerading. You don't have to take [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2553.52s)]
*  this if you don't want. You could be great patriots, say, I don't want a raise. I do not, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2556.8s)]
*  I will not accept it. Let it go back into our country. Let's give it to Gavin Newsom so he can [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2561.92s)]
*  waste it in Los Angeles. No, we don't want to do that, but we're giving. Making a governor the enemy [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2568.08s)]
*  saying that they need to be liberated from the enemy. That is, I mean, I'm just thinking, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2577.36s)]
*  like we have a huge international audience who's watching this. You saw the Pew Research poll [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2584.88s)]
*  about the international perspectives of the United States. You go down from whether it's Canada [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2590.8s)]
*  to Mexico and everyone in between. 77% of Canadians have zero confidence in the United States [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2598.5600000000004s)]
*  leadership. Under Trump, 91% of people in Mexico, even Argentina, where Donald Trump tries to suck [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2604.8s)]
*  up to, 62% have zero confidence to low confidence. 81% in Germany, zero confidence. 78% in France, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2610.88s)]
*  68% zero confidence in Italy, 78% in France, 77% in Netherlands, 68% in Italy, 60% in Poland, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2619.2s)]
*  63% in Greece, 77% no confidence in Australia. But in Israel, 69% has a great degree of confidence [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2629.4399999999996s)]
*  in Donald Trump. Brett? I would say it's such a joke, but it's also dangerous. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2639.3599999999997s)]
*  And yeah, you know, I guess him and Netanyahu have the same style of governing. You got him, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2644.88s)]
*  Netanyahu, Putin. I mean, they're all made from the same cloth, these people. And to see [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2651.52s)]
*  such heinous behavior here in the United States is appalling. It's appalling to see that scene [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2656.48s)]
*  at Fort Bragg with Donald Trump and the United States military being so political. Those are [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  the same. I mean, we covered all the speeches throughout the campaign. The speech we saw [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2670.4s)]
*  at the military base are the same kinds of speeches that Donald Trump would give on the campaign [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2675.84s)]
*  trail. That's not how a president is supposed to act, but Donald Trump is not acting like a president. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2680.08s)]
*  And I think it's all culminating this weekend as we have the no-kings protests this weekend. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2685.52s)]
*  I'm worried about the weekend. I am watching with fear and anxiety. At the same time, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2693.44s)]
*  I'm excited that folks are going to be out there and they're going to be making their voices heard. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2699.84s)]
*  I think it's important that we are out there, that we do show up in numbers, that we do not [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2703.92s)]
*  get afraid of the Trump regime when they make these threats, that we show that there is an [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2710.0s)]
*  opposition. And speaking of opposition, I've been not pleasantly surprised, but it's been great to [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2714.56s)]
*  see leaders emerge in the past couple of weeks. I think if there's any sort of silver lining, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2720.8s)]
*  it's just that, that people are starting to rise to the occasion. And of course, I'm speaking about [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2727.04s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. I mean, me and Ben live in the state. Gavin Newsom has been our governor. I [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2732.0s)]
*  would say Newsom has taken more incoming from Republicans than probably any other governor in [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2737.76s)]
*  the entire country. I mean, they tried to recall the guy, even though he won with like 60 plus [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2743.12s)]
*  percent of the vote, then he ended up winning with the same percentage of the vote after his recall [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  election. Because in a state as big as California, if you just find a large amount of people, but a [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2752.32s)]
*  very small percentage of the state, you could do things like that. And it's a big state. And yeah, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2757.92s)]
*  there are a lot of Republicans here. They're outweighed by Democrats, but they're able to do [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2761.6800000000003s)]
*  stuff like that. And I know a lot of people, especially earlier kind of in the year, were [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2765.76s)]
*  trying to figure out what to think about Newsom as he did his podcast and he was speaking to folks [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2772.8s)]
*  on the other side. And I know people were upset about that. But when I look at a person's character, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2778.56s)]
*  I really look at what are they doing in moments like this? What are they doing in moments of crisis? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2785.36s)]
*  What are their actions tell me about who they are? And I think seeing Newsom rise to the occasion [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2791.2s)]
*  in this past week or two, it's been really impressive to me. And it's been a voice that I think [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2797.04s)]
*  everyone sort of needed. Somebody who could speak with that sort of moral clarity on these issues, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2802.4s)]
*  somebody who can effectively push back to Donald Trump. And I think he's a great foil for Trump, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2807.44s)]
*  as well for a whole host of other reasons. And I got to give it up also to Newsom's digital, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2813.68s)]
*  his social media team, because one of the big issues in our current climate is that there are [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2819.04s)]
*  these algorithms and there are these social media influencers who band together. And on the right, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2824.4s)]
*  they have all these MAGA people who say the same things at the same times every single day, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2829.36s)]
*  just pushing out lies, pushing out lies. And you can look at their tweets sometimes, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2834.8s)]
*  they're literally like word for word with maybe a word here or two changed around. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2837.76s)]
*  But they get on message with the most horrible messaging on the planet, just horrific stuff and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2841.76s)]
*  horrific lies, but they all start just pushing it out and pushing it out. And I think Gavin Newsom's [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2846.32s)]
*  been incredibly effective in these past few days at understanding how this game works in 2025. This [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2851.04s)]
*  wasn't a skill that a politician needed in 2016. You kind of started needing it in 2020. You cannot [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2856.1600000000003s)]
*  be an effective politician in 2025 if you don't have an elite, A++++ digital comms team that every [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2863.44s)]
*  single second of the day is monitoring what is going on, that is pushing back, that is fact [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2873.12s)]
*  checking, that is making sure that people know the truth. And Newsom's team has been absolutely [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  phenomenal. Like I really got to give it up to that whole operation because damn, is it impressive? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2884.8s)]
*  And it's like, finally, you're watching these Democrats just get destroyed on social media and [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2890.96s)]
*  downplayed and say, it's not important, then we should go on the legacy channels, da-da-da-da. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2897.12s)]
*  And Newsom's doing it all. He's going on the legacy channels. He's going on local Fox. He's [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2901.76s)]
*  going on local media. He's going on cable. He's going on the Midas Touch Network where we have [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2906.32s)]
*  the exclusive YouTube stream of the speeches. He's doing it all and he's crushing it on social media. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2909.92s)]
*  And for better or for worse, I'm probably going to argue for worse, that's where our conversations [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2915.44s)]
*  right now that we all have at home with our friends and family are starting now. They're [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2920.08s)]
*  starting on social media and then they're seeping out into the real world and that's what's setting [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2923.68s)]
*  the tone. So absolutely crucial. It's been absolutely great, just great to see that. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2927.44s)]
*  We have some incredible, you know, great clips of Gavin Newsom that I definitely want to show you. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=2934.48s)]

*  still being charged for an old cloud storage account I hadn't used in over a year. I had no idea. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3086.96s)]

*  know we sent you if there's a survey. Real quick, before we get into these Newsom clips, I just want [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3239.04s)]
*  to add to the conversation. I think Newsom's resonating so well and we'll obviously see why [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3242.88s)]
*  when we play these clips. People want fighters. It's that simple. People don't want folks who [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3247.92s)]
*  will cave and cower because they got called Newscom or because they got called a ridiculous name [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3254.0s)]
*  on social media by the quote unquote, dear leader. So to see Newsom rise and meet the moment, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3260.2400000000002s)]
*  what he's doing right now is really just not backing down. And more so than that, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  you could tell that he deeply cares about what's happening in a truly an authentic way. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3272.48s)]
*  There's lives literally on the line right now. And every second counts, every minute counts. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3278.0s)]
*  And to see Newsom rise and meet the occasion day in and day out while this is all happening in his [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3284.2400000000002s)]
*  backyard at the moment, it's been really great to see a leader step up and meet the moment like [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3288.64s)]
*  Newsom is. So Brett, why don't we play some of these clips here? Yeah. And I'll say none of it [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3295.28s)]
*  feels forced. This is just a great reaction to what's happening. He's been getting ahead of [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3299.76s)]
*  it. He's been, I think, acting effectively. I would think our listeners and viewers probably [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3307.76s)]
*  agree as they see him. I assume that they'd be impressed with him too over these past few days. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3313.2000000000003s)]
*  I know I am. And when Ben, when you interviewed him the other day on this podcast, you could hear [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3319.2000000000003s)]
*  it in his voice also, just how much he's been given it. I want to show you just some other clips. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3323.76s)]
*  First, I want to show you a clip from, this is on the local Fox station here in Los Angeles [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3330.0s)]
*  with the great Alex Michaelson, who's a great reporter. I know you hear Foxy go at him. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  But Alex Michaelson is a great reporter here locally on Fox. And you have Gavin Newsom [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3340.48s)]
*  speaking about how Trump lost the step. And I think Gavin, not only does he know how to [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3346.6400000000003s)]
*  get the information out, he also knows how to play the game. And he also knows how to call out what [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3351.28s)]
*  needs to be called out about Donald Trump. And I thought this was a great moment. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3354.96s)]
*  Branches, he can't handle. Because the other night, he came out and said that when you guys [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3357.6s)]
*  spoke, he warned you that if you didn't get things under control, he was going to bring in [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3363.04s)]
*  Stone Cold Liar. Stone Cold Liar. He made that up, like he makes up so many other things. He never [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3367.68s)]
*  said that. And he also seemed to make up this idea that the National Guard did a great job last night [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3377.36s)]
*  when they weren't here. They weren't even deployed and he claimed victory. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3386.0s)]
*  He's lost it. He hasn't lost a step. And I saw him trip on the steps today. I mean, he [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3390.16s)]
*  this is serious. This is a serious. He is not the same person that I dealt with just four years ago. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3398.56s)]
*  And he's incapable. Now, even a train of thought, he's making things up and he's putting people's [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3406.8799999999997s)]
*  lives at risk. And he's got a band of people that are complicit in this. And that's what's so damn [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3414.4s)]
*  alarming. It's so true. And I think too often, reporters, I'm not talking about Alex here, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3421.36s)]
*  but I'm speaking about reporters in general. They view Donald Trump's bluster and his loudness as [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3427.6800000000003s)]
*  cognitive ability when the things he's saying are each more insane than the next. Like listen to [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3434.8s)]
*  what the guy is saying, not to mention the lie after lie after lie after lie. Here, I want to [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3440.08s)]
*  show you from Newsome's speech the other night when he was speaking about how the situation was [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3445.44s)]
*  under control until Donald Trump came in here. Check this out. Thanks to our law enforcement [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3449.68s)]
*  officers and the majority of Angelenos who protested peacefully, the situation was winding [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3454.3199999999997s)]
*  down and was concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown. With that, that's not what Donald [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3460.64s)]
*  Trump wanted. He again chose escalation. He chose more force. He chose theatrics over public safety. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3467.44s)]
*  He federalized another 2,000 guard members. He deployed more than 700 active U.S. Marines. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3475.6s)]
*  These are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement. We honor [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3484.0s)]
*  their service. We honor their bravery, but we do not want our streets militarized by our own [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3489.76s)]
*  armed forces, not in LA, not in California, not anywhere. Speaking of militarized armed forces, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3496.4s)]
*  let me show you Governor Newsome speaking about how Trump is pulling a military dragnet [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3503.04s)]
*  all across Los Angeles. We're seeing unmarked cars, unmarked cars in school parking lots, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3507.52s)]
*  kids afraid of attending their own graduation. Trump is pulling a military dragnet all across [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3514.4s)]
*  Los Angeles, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent and serious criminals. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3522.48s)]
*  His agents are arresting dishwashers, gardeners, day laborers, and seamstresses. That's just [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3528.4s)]
*  weakness, weakness masquerading as strength. Donald Trump's government isn't protecting [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3535.52s)]
*  our communities. They're traumatizing our communities, and that seems to be the entire point. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3541.36s)]
*  These are powerful moments from the governor, and I think one other thing that I wanted to [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3547.44s)]
*  share with you, because I'm not sure if... I doubt that most of you are on these sorts of algorithms, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3551.44s)]
*  but living in Los Angeles, I get fed a lot of LA content when I'm on social media, when I'm on [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3557.28s)]
*  Instagram or TikTok, and there are a lot of folks here who are fighting back, who are showing videos [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3560.8s)]
*  of the peaceful protests that are going on. By the way, I don't see those images on the cable [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  news. I see the images of chaos. I see images, the same images that Trump shows of a Waymo on fire [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3572.24s)]
*  and things like that. I don't see the images of the peaceful protests that I see when I see [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3578.72s)]
*  images, videos that are sent to me, and when people I know are attending these things. I want [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3584.08s)]
*  that to be clear, but also a lot of folks on social media in LA who are just straight out [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3588.72s)]
*  mocking Donald Trump and mocking these talking points from the media, because they're not [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3593.8399999999997s)]
*  just talking points from the media, because for 99% of the city, when you look out your windows, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3599.92s)]
*  when you're going out, nothing's going on. It's a beautiful place. People are enjoying themselves. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3605.92s)]
*  People are at farmers markets. People are going to the movies. People are hanging out, even [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3611.6800000000003s)]
*  downtown. People are going out all over the place. The weather's actually been the best like it's [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3616.88s)]
*  ever been. And so let me show you this video that kind of gets to this point. This is a woman who [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  is walking through LA showing how dangerous Los Angeles is right now and why this is why [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3626.88s)]
*  Donald Trump needs to invade because it's so dangerous. So let's watch this clip. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3631.6000000000004s)]
*  My grandma who only watches Fox News, she called me today. She said, you need to get out of LA. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3635.44s)]
*  LA is burning. Aren't you scared? Meanwhile, this is what's going on in LA. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3639.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3651.84s)]
*  I got snacks. Sometimes people look at me crazy when I say I live in downtown LA. They're like, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3655.8399999999997s)]
*  aren't you scared to live there? Tell me you don't get it without telling me you don't get it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3659.44s)]
*  Show me a city that shows up to defend its citizens the way LA shows up to defend its citizens. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3662.16s)]
*  Police in LA are overwhelmed. We've got to send in the Marines. Send in the Marines. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3677.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, the police in LA. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3681.44s)]
*  Pokemon Go playing motherfuckers got their McDonald's delivered. They're fine. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3691.52s)]
*  That really sums it up. That's how I feel too. And you know, shout out to all the people of [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3699.44s)]
*  Los Angeles who are under attack from this regime. You know, every, I think everybody here, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3703.6s)]
*  you know, feels it, you know, in some ways, you know, if you're in these areas and you hear what [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3709.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying, I mean, you take it as a direct threat, you know, to our city, to our [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3714.56s)]
*  country. And don't, you know, think that Donald Trump isn't going to take this other places also, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3718.96s)]
*  because he is. He's starting here to make a point out of it. But his plan is to do this. And I would [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3723.36s)]
*  say all sorts of, you know, kind of democratic cities throughout the nation using the same lies [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3727.8399999999997s)]
*  as a pretext to send the military in, to try to overthrow governments, to try to scare the people, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3734.0s)]
*  but I'm telling you right now, we're not going to be scared. We're not going to let this guy [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3739.92s)]
*  get us down. We're going to continue to rise up. It's democracy summer. We're going to be out there [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3743.68s)]
*  peacefully protesting. I'm excited for this weekend, you know, King's protest to see folks, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3749.44s)]
*  you know, out there putting in all the work, doing everything, you know, that they can in order to [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3754.64s)]
*  make sure that our country is the way that it's supposed to be. And definitely if you're on the [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3760.16s)]
*  ground this weekend, please, just like all the other protests, tag us in the post, tag us in the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3764.64s)]
*  post. We want to amplify all of that. We want to make sure that your voice is getting heard, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3768.88s)]
*  even beyond just where you are. I think you hear my son in the background. He's having his voice [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3772.96s)]
*  be heard right now. So please, yeah, tag us on it on all social medias and we'll repost as much as [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3776.48s)]
*  we can. Benji. I also don't want us to get distracted. We can walk and chew gum at the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3780.7200000000003s)]
*  same time. We can cover this all. I don't want us to get distracted about the disastrous budget bill [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3787.52s)]
*  that will kick over 10 million Americans off of healthcare, literally rip the lunches out of the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3793.68s)]
*  mouths of school children, massive education cuts, massive agriculture cuts, massive cuts [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3800.96s)]
*  to food stamp programs, supplemental nutrition assistance program, massive cuts to housing and [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3807.04s)]
*  rental assistance, attacks on women's reproductive rights. I could go on and on and on. I mean, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3813.04s)]
*  there was a recent CBO report and other independent groups basically saying that if this [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3818.88s)]
*  Republican budget bill passes, 40% of the country becomes poorer in order to pay essentially for a [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3825.28s)]
*  $270,000 tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. I mean, they're literally ripping a thousand to [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3835.12s)]
*  $2,000 out of the hands of people who make less than $50,000 to give people who are making more [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3842.24s)]
*  than $4.2 million a $270,000 to $500,000 tax cut or higher depending on what your income is in a [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3849.2s)]
*  given year. I unapologetically say tax the rich and tax the rich more. I'm not afraid to say that. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3859.2s)]
*  That's where the people are and that's where you should be. Look, I think that I believe in [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3867.76s)]
*  capitalism. I don't believe the Republicans in MAGA believe in capitalism. I think they believe [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3872.5600000000004s)]
*  in a crony oligarchism that actually is an affront to capitalism. I also believe that we should have [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3877.84s)]
*  compassion. Back in the day, CEOs weren't making 2,000 or 5,000 times what workers were making. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3885.84s)]
*  I believe that if you work a job, you should be paid with dignity. You shouldn't have to work [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3895.2s)]
*  multiple jobs to be able to afford a home. Every American should be able to afford a home. Housing, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3899.44s)]
*  housing, housing should be talked about over and over again. Housing is dignity. We shouldn't have [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3905.04s)]
*  people who can't afford homes, can't afford rent in the United States of America, live paycheck to [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3909.84s)]
*  paycheck and are experiencing the psychological torture of if they can feed their kids or pay [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3915.36s)]
*  their rent or pay their bills. That should never be the case in America. I believe everybody should [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3920.48s)]
*  have healthcare. Everybody should have education. I believe it should be free and available to [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3924.8s)]
*  everybody. And I think it can be paid for if you tax the rich more. I'm not afraid to express that [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3928.96s)]
*  opinion loudly and proudly. That's how I feel about the issues. I believe that diversity is a [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3933.52s)]
*  strength. I don't think that we should punch down on gay people or trans people. They're humans. We [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3939.92s)]
*  should treat them with respect. We should uplift. We should be allies always, not just when it [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3945.44s)]
*  selfishly helps us. We should be there always, period, full stop. To me, these concepts should [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3950.32s)]
*  not be something that Democrats or people who care about humanity grapple with. And when I see [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3956.48s)]
*  somebody who's been here in the United States and they're working hard and they're at a factory and [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3963.52s)]
*  they're living their American dream and they're not criminals, I'm not trying to disappear them to [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3968.8s)]
*  countries that they've never even stepped foot into or deport them without any process or deport [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3974.48s)]
*  them or separate them from their families at all, period. These are people who contribute to our [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3981.04s)]
*  country, who contribute to our economy. You want the biggest proof in the world? You know how Donald [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3986.32s)]
*  Trump likes to say the United States subsidizes Canada because Trump doesn't understand what a [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3991.28s)]
*  deficit is. And even though there's not really a trade deficit between the United States and Canada, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=3996.72s)]
*  Trump just doesn't understand the relationship at all. It's actually significantly advantageous [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4000.88s)]
*  to the United States. Well, the United States isn't subsidizing Canada, but let me tell you who's [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4005.52s)]
*  subsidizing who. California is subsidizing basically all of the red states. All of the red states, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4010.0s)]
*  as Brett alluded to earlier in the show, would be complete and utter failures, failed states. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4016.4s)]
*  They're the worst in education. They've got mortality rates that are disastrous. People die much [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4020.48s)]
*  younger in these red states. They have the worst health care. They're the poorest states by far, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4026.0s)]
*  the worst quality of life, the highest homicide rates and violent crime rates by multiples [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4031.44s)]
*  of California. And by the way, even when you look in California sometimes and you see where the highest [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4038.8s)]
*  homicide rates are, they tend to be in the areas that voted Trump and had Republican leadership, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4043.44s)]
*  but I don't think that's coincidental at all. But California is the fourth largest GDP, not in the [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4047.92s)]
*  United States, in the world. If California was a country, California would have the fourth largest [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4054.56s)]
*  GDP. It is a donor state where most of these red states are taker states. They take from mostly the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4060.32s)]
*  blue states where there's the best education, the highest quality of living, the highest paying jobs, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4067.84s)]
*  the best quality of life. So the red states, kind of like Trump is about all these things too, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4073.36s)]
*  there's a jealousy factor of it. And while they depend literally their taker states, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4078.48s)]
*  as they take from California, they attack the strengths of California that make California [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4084.56s)]
*  strong, which is our diversity. And there's a lot of immigrants in California. And yes, there are [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4091.04s)]
*  undocumented migrants in California. They're also contributing to California and the country. And [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4096.64s)]
*  there should be a pathway to citizenship. We should open up, and most Americans agree with this, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4103.44s)]
*  we should open up a pathway the same way Obama did the Dreamers Act. And Obama was tough on [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4108.799999999999s)]
*  immigration, was very tough on immigration, but he had the Dreamers Act. That type of program [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4114.32s)]
*  should be expanded to people who are paying their taxes, who check in, who have been contributing, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4119.599999999999s)]
*  who have been here, and there should be pathways to citizenship. And absolutely, we should go after [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4125.2s)]
*  the criminals. No doubt, former President Biden was going after the criminals. Trump is sending [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4130.16s)]
*  all of these resources to attack school children and factory workers. And he's moving the resources [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4136.08s)]
*  away from going after the criminals. And he's taking our military away from doing the important [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4142.96s)]
*  thing that's needed. I'll even give you an example. Did you know there's wildfires happening in [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4148.8s)]
*  California and San Bernardino right now? You know who helps with, you know, as Donald Trump likes [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4153.76s)]
*  to say, you got to deal with the forest. You know who actually helps? You know, we do a good job of [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4158.96s)]
*  that in California. And Donald Trump says, you know, the forest nations like Austria, they tell me all [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4163.28s)]
*  the time, how is California so bad? He used to make up that story about Finland. Then he changed it to [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4168.96s)]
*  Austria. And he says that Austria refers to itself as a forest nation. Austria does not refer to itself [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4174.64s)]
*  as a forest nation. He's absolutely just completely making that up. So Trump's removed the National [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4180.64s)]
*  Guard, who would other, and he isn't paying them, by the way. They don't have health care because he's [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4186.56s)]
*  activated them so sloppy. They're sleeping on the floor without pillows. There's like 100 or 200 of [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4191.68s)]
*  them who are like standing around a building, a federal building, because they don't really know [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4198.160000000001s)]
*  what the hell they're doing. The LAPD chief is saying, I don't really know what they're even doing [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4204.8s)]
*  there. I mean, they're standing around in a building. We have to shift our LAPD resources to watch [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4209.360000000001s)]
*  them because they don't know what the hell they're doing. And we're removing National Guard troops [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4215.04s)]
*  away from dealing with wildfire prevention, which is something that's absolutely necessary. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4220.0s)]
*  And so going back to what Newsom said, that's weakness, masquerading as strength. And for all [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4225.12s)]
*  the talks of Doge, what did Congress do? Congress passed a bill today, basically enacting until, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4229.04s)]
*  you know, at least the House did, a bill for what, $9 billion of Doge cuts. After all of this Doge, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4236.0s)]
*  the bill they did was $9 billion. And it was like attacking PBS, like attacking Oscar the Grouch, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4243.28s)]
*  like the strangest and most deranged things that's hurting the country, that's making us weaker. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4253.84s)]
*  And then you had, on top of all of this, you had Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban refugees, the same [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4260.08s)]
*  way a lot of these vaguer Republican Congress members and state senators, our sons and daughters [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4268.0s)]
*  of Venezuelan refugees, our sons and daughters of Cuban refugees, as they bring in their own [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4272.24s)]
*  Chavez, as they bring in their own Maduro, as they bring in their, as they bring in their own Castro, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4279.36s)]
*  you have Marco Rubio saying happy Russia Day and wishing the Russian Federation well in this. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4285.679999999999s)]
*  We hope to do business with you. And if it says we hope to do business with the Russian Federation [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4293.2s)]
*  again in the future, that's weakness masquerading as strength. And Donald Trump on the red carpet [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4298.64s)]
*  going to lay mis as he like weirdly holds Melania's thumb. But as I said, don't get distracted. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4305.6s)]
*  The budget bill is an absolute disaster. Donald Trump has still not released the Epstein files. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4313.4400000000005s)]
*  And remember, you had Elon Musk saying he's in the Epstein files, he's in the Epstein files. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4319.52s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have a lot of we start activating the National Guard pretty quickly [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4323.84s)]
*  and federalizing them unlawfully. So don't be, we're not going to get distracted here about all of [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4329.4400000000005s)]
*  that. And when you talk to people, let people know about all of these things that are going on. That's [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4335.28s)]
*  why on this episode, we cover trade, we cover what Trump is doing in the Middle East, we cover [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4340.400000000001s)]
*  what's going on domestically with the bill, we cover Epstein. And of course, we cover the news [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4346.96s)]
*  of the day. We have a special, a special announcement right now though for everybody as well. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4351.12s)]
*  So right after this, I'm doing a town hall. I guess you're putting me to more work. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4356.96s)]
*  Let's go. As soon as this ends, I'm going to be speaking with Kansas Governor, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4361.28s)]
*  Laura Kelly, and I'm going to be speaking with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4368.08s)]
*  And we're going to do a small little town hall. I'm going to, you guys are working me hard. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4372.8s)]
*  So that's a big deal. As soon as this ends, just stay on. If you're in this chat, we're going to [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4376.88s)]
*  transfer you to that town hall. Watch it. I think I'll probably go 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or so [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4382.32s)]
*  by 30 minutes, I'll probably go with the governors. I want to get there. As I said, don't get distracted. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4388.400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to talk about the budget bill. I'm going to see how it's affecting people in Michigan, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4393.92s)]
*  affecting people in Kansas. And a reminder, we are adding lots of new bonus content on this [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkpbKZ_32R8&t=4398.72s)]
