Video Description: On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: While the markets nosedived and resembled a Trump meme coin, Donald Trump spent yet another weekend golfing—this time declaring himself the winner of his own tournament. Meanwhile, deadly storms killed 18 Americans, four U.S. soldiers died in Lithuania, and Trump said nothing. We break down Trump’s Oval Office press conference with Israeli PM Netanyahu, where they laid out plans for Gaza with no Palestinian input, as major protests erupted across the country demanding a ceasefire. Plus, we cover a chilling new Supreme Court ruling allowing a Trump-era policy to stand—one that forcibly deported a migrant to a so-called "concentration camp" in El Salvador. Buckle up. Ben, Brett and Jordy break it all down.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 4/7/25
**MeidasTouch:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg)
*  Donald Trump was golfing once again this weekend after crashing the markets on Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump announcing that he won yet another golf tournament and that was blasted on state regime media known as Fox. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=7.0s)]
*  Today, by the way, is Donald Trump returned to Washington, D.C. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=15.0s)]
*  The market now resembles a Trump meme coin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=19.0s)]
*  Down, up, down, up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=23.0s)]
*  It does not look like a stable market. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=25.0s)]
*  Many CEOs are saying that the country is already in a recession. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=27.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's message, he's not going to change anything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=32.0s)]
*  He doesn't give an F. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=35.0s)]
*  Also, throughout the country, as Trump was posting these photos of himself playing golf and also making posts saying, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=38.0s)]
*  Trump is intentionally crashing the markets. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=45.0s)]
*  We also learned tragic news. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=47.0s)]
*  Storms across the country killed 18 Americans. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=49.0s)]
*  The United States received four American soldiers who died in Lithuania. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=53.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was not at that ceremony where you would normally see a president. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=59.0s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach to golf. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=64.0s)]
*  And then today, Donald Trump was in the Oval Office with who else? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=69.0s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=72.0s)]
*  And with Netanyahu by his side, Donald Trump was talking about seizing control of Gaza, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=75.0s)]
*  putting American forces or peace forces in Gaza and calling it a great piece of real estate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=80.0s)]
*  But throughout this weekend as well, we saw major protests sweep the country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=87.0s)]
*  The hands-off protests, which we were covering here at all levels at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=92.0s)]
*  I think there was about over five million protesters when you add up all of the different cities, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=99.0s)]
*  thousands of cities and towns across the country and the world, notably corporate news, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=105.0s)]
*  really did not cover this at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=110.0s)]
*  But thankfully here at the Midas Touch Network, we made it a priority to cover those. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=112.0s)]
*  The same way we made it a priority to focus on these shadow hearings being held by Democrats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=117.0s)]
*  Today we were getting 30,000, 35,000 viewers at some point in time while we were watching that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=124.0s)]
*  as they focused on Donald Trump's attack of lawyers and the Department of Justice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=130.0s)]
*  And speaking of the law, I want to talk about this horrible Supreme Court ruling from earlier in the day [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=135.0s)]
*  about the kidnapping of a migrant from El Salvador who the Trump regime sent back to El Salvador [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=141.0s)]
*  against the order of a court, an immigration court from 2019. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=149.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court stopped a lower court order which directed the Trump regime to bring back [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=153.0s)]
*  this individual. So Trump now has more time to delay as this individual rots in a El Salvador concentration camp. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=159.0s)]
*  And the implications here are just broader than that individual as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=168.0s)]
*  If Trump can do that to this individual, who else can he do that to? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=171.0s)]
*  We'll talk about that and more here on the Midas Touch Podcast. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=175.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Beissel, joined by Brett and Jordy. Brothers, how are you doing? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=177.0s)]
*  Doing great. Great to see you, brothers. Great to see everybody watching. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=180.0s)]
*  Great to be speaking with all the people listening on Apple Podcasts on Spotify. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=183.0s)]
*  Wherever you get your podcasts, what a weekend, you guys. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=187.0s)]
*  The hands-off protests, absolutely incredible. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=190.0s)]
*  The biggest mobilization that we have seen today to date. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=193.0s)]
*  Hey, Donald, you finally got those crowds that you were talking about, but not the crowds that you were hoping for. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=197.0s)]
*  The people are fed up, folks. And it was such an honor to cover these protests, honestly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=203.0s)]
*  I'm so impressed by all the groups that organized this, by all the people out there who took to the streets. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=207.0s)]
*  All of you out there, I know so many of you listening, made your own signs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=212.0s)]
*  You guys were out there putting in the hard work. I loved seeing your signs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=216.0s)]
*  I noticed a lot of people with Midas Touch signs as well out there, which I thought was super, super cool. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=219.0s)]
*  We had our correspondents on the ground. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=225.0s)]
*  Tennessee Brando spoke at the Los Angeles event. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=227.0s)]
*  We were doing the live coverage, the reports. We were city to city interviewing the organizers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=230.0s)]
*  What a weekend for democracy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=235.0s)]
*  The democracy does indeed have a pulse. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=238.0s)]
*  And on the other hand, you see Donald Trump right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=241.0s)]
*  Let's face it. This is the most disastrous beginning of a presidency that we have ever seen in the history of this country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=244.0s)]
*  Crashing the markets, national security failures, ruining all of our foreign policy, destroying our alliances. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=251.0s)]
*  It's like a speed run with the destruction of America coming from this administration. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=258.0s)]
*  We are going to get into all of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=263.0s)]
*  But first, you know, I got to toss it to Jordy and see how little bro is doing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=265.0s)]
*  What's up, Jordy? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=268.0s)]
*  What's up, everybody? I am so stoked to get into it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=269.0s)]
*  Brett, to your point exactly, man, the energy from the protest, the energy is palpable, man. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=271.0s)]
*  There is a dramatic vibe shift and people are just fed the f up, man. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=276.0s)]
*  This is like unlike anything we've ever seen before. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=283.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm motivated after watching everything go down over the weekend. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=286.0s)]
*  I love seeing all the signs, just like you said, Brett. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=291.0s)]
*  Thanks to everyone for tagging us in all of those posts and just shout out to everyone on the ground this weekend. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=293.0s)]
*  That was that was freaking awesome. Benji, where do you want to start us off? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=297.0s)]
*  I just want to reflect on that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=300.0s)]
*  It was probably one of the biggest mass mobilizations, if not the biggest in the history of the United States. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=302.0s)]
*  I think in the total, I've been speaking with the organizers, about five million people in the different cities and towns showed up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=309.0s)]
*  And by the way, red areas, blue areas, purple areas, people showed up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=316.0s)]
*  But the fact that it got minimal attention from corporate news tells you everything that you need to know there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=320.0s)]
*  I mean, in normal times where there wasn't an authoritarian who made corporate news, bend the knee and kiss the ring, this should be a front page story. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=327.0s)]
*  But good news, we're covering it here every step of the way on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=335.0s)]
*  And the contrast between that image of people rising up as Donald Trump was golfing in a tournament at his own resort that was funded by the Saudis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=339.0s)]
*  Donald Trump doing business deals with the Saudis, sovereign wealth fund to enrich himself and his family while the American people are suffering. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=351.0s)]
*  Right. Thursday, Friday saw what? Like ten trillion dollars of market value just erased from the stock market. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=361.0s)]
*  And that means people's 401Ks and tensions were destroyed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=369.0s)]
*  We're seeing companies laying off people, the chaos created in the business community. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=374.0s)]
*  I mean, you have people even like the CEO and founder of Home Depot, Ken Langone, you know, like longtime Republican donor saying this is like the stupidest thing you could possibly ever do. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=380.0s)]
*  And literally word for word, this is the dumbest thing imaginable. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=390.0s)]
*  And then Donald Trump just making posts over the weekend, like just toying with the people, like just cruelly toying with the people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=394.0s)]
*  I mean, he posted a video that said Trump is intentionally crashing the markets. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=402.0s)]
*  He posted a video that said that and then he attributed to Warren Buffett. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=407.0s)]
*  Congratulations that this is what Warren Buffett thought was brilliant. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=413.0s)]
*  So Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, had to come out with the statement through Berkshire Hathaway saying he's not endorsing this phony video that says that he's endorsing Trump's plan to crash the markets. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=417.0s)]
*  I just want to reflect on that for a moment as well. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=429.0s)]
*  The president of the United States, though it pains me to say that, from his official account, is posting video saying that he's intentionally crashing the market and you have still the entire Republican party like, okay, we've got to give him space, give him some time, let him cook. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=431.0s)]
*  I think this is going to be a good thing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=448.0s)]
*  I think this is exactly what he ran on. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=450.0s)]
*  He said there were going to be lower prices on day one. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=452.0s)]
*  Not that he was going to crash the entire economy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=456.0s)]
*  And as I've said before, and as Carl Keaton says, trying to cook a steak by burning down the entire house and destroying people's lives and saying, you know what though? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=459.0s)]
*  Gas is cheaper. You're all screwed, but maybe you could get a little bit of cheaper gas at the bottom. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=468.0s)]
*  I've been noticing that line too. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=473.0s)]
*  By the way, you remember what I told you guys like a week or two ago? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=475.0s)]
*  I said, just wait for the pivot, guys. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=477.0s)]
*  I said, wait for the pivot because oil is going to come down because we're heading into a recession if not a depression. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=479.0s)]
*  That's a signature sign that that is happening. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=484.0s)]
*  And so watch that collapse and then watch Donald Trump and watch all these MAGA people go, oh boy, look how much oil has come down and like clockwork. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=487.0s)]
*  That's the propaganda that they shifted to. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=494.0s)]
*  Basically today they started that one amid this total chaos. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=496.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump heads back on Air Force One from his golf tournament where he brags about how great he played golf and that he won all of the tournaments and how he's got a great handicap. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=500.0s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=509.0s)]
*  And he's asked questions on Air Force One. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=510.0s)]
*  This Bloomberg reporter has been doing a great job, you know, I think asking the right questions here. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=513.0s)]
*  Donald Trump calls the question stupid when she asks, what kind of pain tolerance do you think the American people are going to take? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=517.0s)]
*  He calls her stupid and then he says the American people need to take their medicine. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=525.0s)]
*  I'm feeding them the medicine. You need to take the medicine. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=530.0s)]
*  This is what sociopaths, abusers sound like. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=533.0s)]
*  Here, let's play this clip. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=535.0s)]
*  I think your question is so stupid. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=537.0s)]
*  I don't want anything to go down. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=540.0s)]
*  But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=543.0s)]
*  And we have such a horrible we have been treated so badly by other countries because we had so many people who were in the hospital. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=546.0s)]
*  America is the was the richest nation in the world. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=557.0s)]
*  America under former President Biden had the highest GDP growth. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=562.0s)]
*  We had low unemployment. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=568.0s)]
*  We had record job growth. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=569.0s)]
*  We were energy independent. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=571.0s)]
*  We had a lot of unemployment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=573.0s)]
*  We had a lot of unemployment. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=575.0s)]
*  We had a lot of unemployment. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=577.0s)]
*  We had a lot of unemployment. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=579.0s)]
*  We had a lot of unemployment. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=581.0s)]
*  We had record job growth. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=583.0s)]
*  We were energy independent. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=584.0s)]
*  And as we'll show you later in this episode, you know, now what these Trump regime officials like Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary and Brooke Rollins, the Agriculture Secretary and Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary, like what they're saying is what we want to do is, you know, like how in China they put together the iPhones. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=586.0s)]
*  Like we want to create those factories here so that Americans are putting all the screws and widgets together into the iPhones and that they think that Americans are miraculously going to start doing those jobs. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=607.0s)]
*  At the same time, they're also saying that they want AI and robots to replace low wage labor jobs as well. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=619.0s)]
*  Nothing that they say makes sense. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=627.0s)]
*  And as we'll talk about later in the show as well, the tariff formula for their Liberation Day, which is really Annihilation Day or Great Recession or Depression or Liquidation Day, whatever you want to call it, the very formula is incorrect. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=628.0s)]
*  Even a conservative think tanks are saying your formula, which is also not based on reciprocal tariffs, which is based on your calculating trade deficits as a form of a tariff, which makes no sense. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=641.0s)]
*  But even if you applied this concept that a deficit is a tariff somehow, the formula is applied incorrectly. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=655.0s)]
*  And it just goes to show everything they do is just incorrect and erroneous as well. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=662.0s)]
*  But let's get back to what I was going down on Air Force One where Donald Trump landing into D.C. after vacationing again on the taxpayer dime again has storms led to the death of about 18 Americans in areas like Tennessee and Arkansas, which Trump said nothing about. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=667.0s)]
*  Trump hasn't made any public statements on his own, his own volition about the American soldiers who died in Lithuania. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=683.0s)]
*  But here he is talking about how great of a golf game he has and how he's got such a great handicap with golf. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=688.0s)]
*  And, you know, I won the tournament here. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=695.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=697.0s)]
*  Any questions? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=698.0s)]
*  Very good. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=701.0s)]
*  Very good. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=703.0s)]
*  Good to win. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=706.0s)]
*  You heard I won. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=707.0s)]
*  Did you hear I won? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=709.0s)]
*  Just to back it up. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=710.0s)]
*  There I won. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=713.0s)]
*  What's your handicap these days? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=715.0s)]
*  I like to win very low. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=716.0s)]
*  I have a very low handicap. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=717.0s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=719.0s)]
*  Sir, Chinese Foreign Minister. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=720.0s)]
*  Back up a little. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=722.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=723.0s)]
*  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the market is. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=724.0s)]
*  What in the Kim Jong Un is that right here? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=727.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, let me answer. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=729.0s)]
*  What in the Kim Jong Un is that state regime media known as Fox with people like Jesse Waters? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=731.0s)]
*  While the markets are crashing, while the futures were down enormous amounts, they were on Friday over the weekend. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=737.0s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=746.0s)]
*  They were saying this is courage. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=747.0s)]
*  He's staring the stock market in the face. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=749.0s)]
*  He's golfing in the face of a crash. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=752.0s)]
*  This is what bravery looks like. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=755.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=757.0s)]
*  Trump's trade war is high risk, high reward, but he's not biting his fingernails staring at the Dow. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=758.0s)]
*  Today, he actually played golf, which if Biden had done, I definitely wouldn't have criticized him for it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=764.0s)]
*  The way they make a mockery, Brett, Jordan, minus mighty, they're telling the people what ridiculous propaganda they have. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=773.0s)]
*  And this isn't funny. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=781.0s)]
*  These this is people's lives that they're playing with. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=783.0s)]
*  And they've got their viewers so magma mush brainwashed their Fox viewers. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=787.0s)]
*  This is people's lives, though, and they treat it like it's like it's a game and like it's funny. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=792.0s)]
*  Out of all the hosts on Fox also, Jesse Waters in particular has an incredible level of disdain for his own viewers because he mocks them like that on a nightly basis. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=797.0s)]
*  Every single night, he's making comments like that, acknowledging that he's in on the scheme. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=806.0s)]
*  He's in on the scam. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=811.0s)]
*  He's in on exactly what they are doing at Fox. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=812.0s)]
*  And right now they have to run protection for Donald Trump. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=815.0s)]
*  These disastrous policies, they have to make it seem like, OK, you are looking in your 401k accounts. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=818.0s)]
*  You are getting laid off from your job. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=823.0s)]
*  How can we spin this as a good thing? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=825.0s)]
*  And they go into overdrive and it gets more and more ridiculous as they try to counter what's actually happening in reality with their spin. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=827.0s)]
*  And that's why and we'll show some more clips, too, because like the level of like North Korea style propaganda that we are seeing from the Trump regime right now is like nothing we have ever seen before in the United States of America. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=835.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump is going full authoritarian. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=846.0s)]
*  He is leaning into all the things that they do in authoritarian countries in North Korea, in Russia. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=849.0s)]
*  We'll talk about the military parade that he wants to hold for himself on his birthday soon as well. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=854.0s)]
*  But all the things that he is doing make the people suffer and make them beg you for the scraps. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=859.0s)]
*  That's a typical thing that dictators have done throughout history. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=865.0s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump is doing right here. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=868.0s)]
*  Make the people suffer, then make them beg you for help. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=870.0s)]
*  And then you throw them little breadcrumbs and then they go, oh, thank you, Mr. Trump. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=873.0s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=877.0s)]
*  That's what he wants from people right now. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=879.0s)]
*  And the issue with this whole tariff scheme is this was done in the worst way possible. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=881.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, no matter how much I disagree with what Trump is doing here and I disagree with what he's doing vehemently, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=884.0s)]
*  I think his plan is absolutely atrocious and it's clearly destroying the markets and putting uncertainty in the markets. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=890.0s)]
*  But even if there was a world where I did agree somehow with what Trump was doing, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=896.0s)]
*  there is a reasonable way to roll things out so that it doesn't ruin people's lives, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=901.0s)]
*  so that it doesn't throw businesses into chaos, so that it doesn't make people unemployed. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=907.0s)]
*  There's a way to make it so the business community is able to prepare for these tariffs. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=913.0s)]
*  There's a way to make it so other countries are able to prepare so that we could have an honest way of doing trade. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=917.0s)]
*  But because Trump always because everything is projection with Trump, Trump calls everybody else abusers. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=922.0s)]
*  When Trump himself is the abuser, he is abusing the global trade system. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=930.0s)]
*  And I just want you to think like, listen, I'll put out this hypothetical right now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=935.0s)]
*  Trump's been changing his mind on these tariffs like every other day. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=939.0s)]
*  It's this rate, it's that rate, we're taking it away, we're negotiating with these countries. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=943.0s)]
*  No, we're not negotiating with these countries. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=947.0s)]
*  If you're a business in the United States, and even if you want to build a factory in the United States because of these tariffs, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=949.0s)]
*  are you going to sink millions, if not tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars into building a factory in the United States? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=957.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump can one day come on in and say, I'm just kidding about that tariff. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=966.0s)]
*  I'm actually taking away that tariff. I cut a deal. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=971.0s)]
*  I got that. I got us a good deal. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=973.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, that company's investments in this factory were for nothing and they just lost a whole bunch of money. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=975.0s)]
*  And their competition now is way ahead of them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=982.0s)]
*  You can't negotiate. You can't do business here abroad. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=985.0s)]
*  You can't do anything with somebody who is so unstable like Donald Trump. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=988.0s)]
*  And the one thing that you need, if you're in the business community, the one thing that you need if you want to work in general is stability. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=993.0s)]
*  There's nothing more important than stability. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1001.0s)]
*  And there is nothing less that I could say that is a quality of Donald Trump than stability. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1003.0s)]
*  There's no strategy here. There is zero coherence here. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1009.0s)]
*  It is full on chaos, nonstop. And it's just not a good thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1013.0s)]
*  This is why you see even these billionaire CEOs and a lot of these oligarchs who have backed Donald Trump. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1017.0s)]
*  I'm talking the Bill Ackman's of the world. I'm even talking Elon Musk came out and said that he didn't like tariffs. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1023.0s)]
*  There's a reason why they are all panicking as well, because they know that this is a stupid idea that is going to wreck their companies. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1029.0s)]
*  And everything's going to have a domino effect here also as the stock market goes down, as investors get margin called, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1036.0s)]
*  as these companies are struggled to keep up with everything that's going on, they're going to have to lay off more people. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1044.0s)]
*  Now these people aren't going to be able to find jobs at other places. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1051.0s)]
*  America's as a competitive leader in the world is completely ruined. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1054.0s)]
*  And those jobs, even Howard Lutnick of the Trump administration right now is admitting that if those jobs even were to come back here, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1058.0s)]
*  which is unlikely to begin with, that they would be robots doing the jobs, not American workers. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1065.0s)]
*  So they are completely setting this up, like all of their scams, to help the billionaires, to help the factory owners, but not the factory workers. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1071.0s)]
*  And right now, Trump is just, this is just a perfect storm that this administration has created. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1080.0s)]
*  And the Republicans could end it in two seconds if they wanted to. They could pass legislation to stop this at any point. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1085.0s)]
*  But you have the cowards like Mike Johnson who refuse and this entire Republican Party who refuse to do anything about this. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1091.0s)]
*  Exactly, Brett. The coverage that mainstream media and congressional Republicans, the Republican Party at large, is giving Trump right now is utterly ridiculous. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1099.0s)]
*  And it should light a fire just under every single American because they are gaslighting you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1109.0s)]
*  They are all gaslighting you at once. And they just hope you don't care enough. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1115.0s)]
*  They hope that they could distract you with the trans volleyball player on San Jose State or this issue or that issue and not look at your 401Ks. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1120.0s)]
*  It was trans billboards today, Geordi. Trans billiards. And I think it was a billiards game from like two years ago. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1127.0s)]
*  That's what they're running with on Fox today. The Republicans in Congress have absolutely zero backbone. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1133.0s)]
*  And this is going to go down as just one of the biggest stains on the Republican Party forever. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1140.0s)]
*  As long as there is a country, everyone's going to remember where these Republicans stood at this moment in time. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1147.0s)]
*  When the stock market's crashing, when businesses are terrified, everyone will remember where these Republicans stood. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1153.0s)]
*  And it's going to make a difference. And you know why it's so infuriating, too? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1160.0s)]
*  We just actually have to ask the question. Donald Trump's cognitive ability. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1164.0s)]
*  Can you even call it a cognitive ability? He's not all there. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1168.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying that to be dramatic or just for the clicks and the likes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1172.0s)]
*  It's very obvious by his speech and what he cares to put out in public that he's not being a very serious person right now. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1177.0s)]
*  And the only thing that I can conclude is that he is simply just not all there. He wants to talk about his golf game. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1184.0s)]
*  He wants to talk about going to these golf tournaments and that he competes. He's not Jack Nicholson. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1190.0s)]
*  What are we talking about? We just accept that this guy competes in these like senior golf championships and he hoist the trophy that they give him and they give him every putt. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1196.0s)]
*  This is some really sick stuff that we're witnessing. This is the guy that has the nuclear coats. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1205.0s)]
*  OK, and the Republicans in Congress are just covering his ass. Why? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1210.0s)]
*  Why? We need to ask the questions here, because at the end of the day, it's every single American and future Americans who are going to be paying the price for this disgusting, ridiculous behavior. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1215.0s)]
*  The jury said he's not Jack Nicholson. I think he meant Jack Nicklaus. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1224.0s)]
*  I always confuse them. I'm so thrilled that you called me out on that because everyone picked up on the difference there. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1228.0s)]
*  Well, Jordan, going back to what Brett said, I would say that this whatever it is, it's textbook authoritarian mindset, which is, by the way, I mean, Vladimir Putin goes and sits on horses with his shirt off and he tries to act like he's so strong. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1235.0s)]
*  And he says that he wins these Jiu-Jitsu competitions. Right. Kim Jong-un is photographed a certain way. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1249.0s)]
*  This is part of the authoritarian playbook. And part of the authoritarian playbook is you make people suffer. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1255.0s)]
*  You think Putin cares about how people in Russia are doing? No. You think Kim Jong-un cares about how people in North Korea are doing? No. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1261.0s)]
*  Authoritarians don't care how their people are doing. In fact, authoritarians actually want their populations to suffer and do worse so that their populations go and beg, beg for breadcrumbs. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1268.0s)]
*  And they are the ones as the authoritarians who hand out the breadcrumbs. They view economic independence and actually, you know, Donald Trump is all projection and confession. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1281.0s)]
*  Trump views economic independence as liberation. Trump's Liberation Day is liberation of an authoritarian ethos and actually crushing the freedom of Americans. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1291.0s)]
*  And that's why I think he uses that term as well, because now people have to go and beg for exemptions. I need your help. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1302.0s)]
*  Countries have to in his mind beg him for exemption. So now he becomes in his own mind the most important person who gets to basically say, I give you this exemption. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1309.0s)]
*  I give you you go bankrupt. You go bankrupt. He likes to see that he's crashing international markets. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1318.0s)]
*  That that gives him joy to feel that he has that power and people have to go and beg and beg and beg. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1324.0s)]
*  The thing is, is that the international community is forming their own alliances. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1330.0s)]
*  Now, in the short term, they're trying to stop the bleeding in the long term. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1335.0s)]
*  They're viewing America as no longer a reliable ally and that they have to create new structures to isolate the United States. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1339.0s)]

*  Let's take our first quick break of the show. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1487.44s)]
*  Before I found public rec, I dreaded putting on real pants. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1490.28s)]
*  You know, the ones, tight waistbands, stiff fabric, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1494.48s)]
*  squeezing all the wrong places. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1497.08s)]
*  Honestly, it would make me like not even want to go out at all. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1498.48s)]
*  But then I discovered public rec and everything changed. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1501.48s)]
*  I'm obsessed with these pants. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1504.28s)]
*  The first time I slipped them on, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1505.48s)]
*  I could not believe how comfortable they were. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1506.68s)]
*  It felt like I was wearing joggers, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1508.88s)]
*  but I looked like I could walk into a nice dinner [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1510.28s)]
*  or hit the bar. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1512.08s)]
*  I've worn them to meetings, out to grab drinks, to workouts, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1513.08s)]
*  and even on a long flight. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1515.68s)]
*  And yep, I have a lot of fun with them. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1516.68s)]
*  And yep, I have absolutely fallen asleep in them too. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1518.68s)]
*  Public rec nails that perfect balance [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1521.88s)]
*  between comfort and style. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1523.48s)]
*  True story, after I got my first pair, I loved them so much. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1525.0800000000002s)]
*  I went right back on their website [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1528.28s)]
*  and ordered them in just about every single color. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1529.68s)]
*  I am already eyeing their shorts and hoodies next. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1532.0800000000002s)]
*  Comfortable enough for the couch, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1535.0800000000002s)]
*  sharp enough for the city. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1536.28s)]
*  For a limited time, you can get 20% off at public rec [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1537.48s)]

*  after a night of drinking, it's with pre-alcohol. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1557.48s)]
*  Zbiotic's pre-alcohol probiotic drink [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1560.0800000000002s)]
*  is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1562.48s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1565.48s)]
*  to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1567.2800000000002s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1569.68s)]
*  When you drink, alcohol gets converted [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1570.88s)]
*  into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1572.88s)]
*  It's this byproduct, not dehydration, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1575.08s)]
*  that's the blame for your rough next day. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1577.48s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  to break this byproduct down. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1581.48s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  your first drink of the night. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1585.48s)]
*  Drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1587.08s)]
*  Every time I have pre-alcohol before drinks, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1590.6799999999998s)]
*  I notice a difference the next day. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1592.6799999999998s)]
*  Even after a night out, I can confidently plan [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1594.6799999999998s)]
*  on having a great next day without worrying. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  Look, I won't lie, I was a bit on the fence [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1599.48s)]
*  about pre-alcohol initially, but then while hanging out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  with some friends over at our local brewery, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1604.28s)]
*  I gave it a shot and believe me, it's the real deal. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1606.48s)]
*  When I first gave pre-alcohol a try months ago, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1609.68s)]
*  I was at a wedding, I drank it before my first martini, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1612.08s)]
*  and you wouldn't believe how on top of my game [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1614.68s)]

*  before the break, that's right out [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  of the authoritarian playbook. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1701.88s)]
*  The Trump regime, specifically Trump, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1703.48s)]
*  wants everything to be at his whim. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1706.48s)]
*  I say this, the market rises. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1708.88s)]
*  I say this, the market crashes. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1710.88s)]
*  That creates, ultimately, though, in the long run, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1714.0800000000002s)]
*  the perfect recipe for the worst-case scenario [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1717.48s)]

*  We're not reliable, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1723.08s)]
*  we're not a stable place to do business, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1724.28s)]
*  and it's just a matter of time, though, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1726.68s)]
*  before the international community [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1728.48s)]

*  that basically isolate and alienate [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1735.08s)]
*  the United States economy for generations. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1737.28s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing the boycott, of course, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1740.48s)]
*  elbows up from Canada, tourism boycott [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1742.68s)]

*  It's clearly going to be that bad. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1761.48s)]
*  I think in some areas, it's like 75 to 80% boycotts [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1763.48s)]
*  of certain types of leisure, travel, and tourism. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1767.88s)]

*  and then y'all aren't following what's happening in Canada. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1774.88s)]
*  Also, a boycott of goods, also. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1777.0800000000002s)]

*  in Europe, in Australia, in New Zealand, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1782.68s)]

*  I wanna share with you what's going on, though, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1791.2800000000002s)]
*  from the Trump propagandists [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1793.0800000000002s)]
*  while all of this is taking place. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1795.48s)]
*  So Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1796.68s)]
*  who was previously living in a $22 million replica [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1799.2800000000002s)]
*  of Barbie's Mansion, or whatever you call it, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1803.88s)]
*  Malibu Barbie Mansion, or whatever they're calling it, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1807.48s)]
*  like a pink $22 million mansion [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1810.28s)]
*  in Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1813.0800000000002s)]
*  And this guy's like the most arrogant guy in the world. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1815.48s)]
*  So he's asked, what's your message to the American people [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1817.68s)]
*  who are suffering right now? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1821.0800000000002s)]
*  And let me just show you what he says. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1822.68s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1824.0800000000002s)]
*  What is your message to Americans who want to retire [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1825.88s)]
*  right now and who've just seen their lifetime savings [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1829.28s)]
*  drop significantly? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1833.28s)]
*  I think that's a false narrative. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1834.8799999999999s)]
*  Americans who wanna retire right now, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1836.28s)]
*  Americans who have put away for years [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  in their savings accounts, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1841.08s)]
*  I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1843.08s)]
*  of what's happening. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1847.28s)]
*  Really, you think Americans don't look [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1849.48s)]
*  at the day-to-day fluctuations in what's happening [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1851.8799999999999s)]
*  and that Americans have enough in their savings [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1855.28s)]
*  to not care about these market crashes? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1858.48s)]
*  That's what the Trump regime is messaging. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1861.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1863.88s)]
*  You need to face pain and suffering and hardship. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1865.28s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1867.88s)]
*  Take a look at agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1870.0800000000002s)]
*  He or she is asked, I think, a very fair question. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1874.48s)]
*  Why would you tariff penguins? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1877.88s)]
*  Why are you tariffing American military bases? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1880.88s)]
*  Don't you see that this looks sloppy and dangerous? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1883.88s)]
*  Take a listen to what she says in response. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1888.28s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1890.0800000000002s)]
*  President Trump laid out with a giant graphic [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1891.08s)]
*  of all the countries where tariffs were gonna be, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1893.48s)]
*  what he called reciprocal tariffs, were gonna be imposed. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1895.8799999999999s)]
*  You're imposing a 10% tariff [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1899.28s)]
*  on the herd and McDonald Islands. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1901.28s)]
*  The herd and McDonald Islands have zero human inhabitants. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1903.28s)]
*  They have zero exports. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  They have zero imports. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1908.28s)]
*  They do have a lot of penguins. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1909.6799999999998s)]
*  Why are you putting import tariffs on islands [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1911.48s)]
*  that are entirely populated by penguins? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, that, come on, Jake. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1918.48s)]
*  Obviously, here's the bottom line. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1921.08s)]
*  We live under a tariff regime from other countries. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1924.68s)]
*  We have too long seeded. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1928.48s)]
*  The McDonald Islands is not imposing. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1930.08s)]
*  The idea that America goes first. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1931.88s)]
*  I mean, come on, whatever. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1934.48s)]
*  Listen, the people that are leading this are serious, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1937.08s)]
*  intentional, patriotic, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1939.68s)]
*  the smartest people I've ever worked with. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1942.08s)]
*  I... [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1944.08s)]
*  Usually, the smartest people don't go out and say, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1946.08s)]
*  I'm the smartest person. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1950.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm the most patriotic and stable person. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  That's usually not the way smart people conduct themselves. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1955.28s)]
*  And then just the premise is a lie. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1958.6799999999998s)]
*  We're living a tariff regime under other people. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1963.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, y'all are calculating tariffs [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1965.28s)]
*  based on trade deficits [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1968.6799999999998s)]
*  and based on some cockamamie formula. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1971.28s)]
*  That's also applied wrong [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1974.48s)]
*  based on trade deficits with country. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1976.88s)]
*  And as people said, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1979.88s)]
*  who cares if there's a trade deficit with Vietnam? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1981.48s)]
*  We're buying more. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1984.48s)]
*  Of course, we're going to be buying more cheaper products [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1985.68s)]
*  from a country like Vietnam [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1988.08s)]
*  than they're going to be buying from the United States. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1990.08s)]
*  What are we even talking about here? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1993.48s)]
*  Why is that some... [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1995.88s)]
*  And why are we using that delta [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1997.08s)]
*  as part of some methodology to calculate [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=1999.48s)]
*  that they're tariffing this amount? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2002.48s)]
*  And then you see they spike the football [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2004.48s)]
*  and they're like, we got Cambodia to break. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2006.48s)]
*  Cambodia says that they... [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2009.48s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2011.48s)]
*  You got Cambodia to break. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2012.68s)]
*  You got Vietnam to break and submit [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2014.08s)]
*  while Europe is standing up. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2016.48s)]
*  All these people are... [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2018.08s)]
*  All these other countries are building structures. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2019.48s)]
*  And basically... [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2022.08s)]
*  Ben, I want to say this too, if I can. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2022.48s)]
*  So Trump in his best case scenario [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2024.08s)]
*  and his big pitch for why these tariffs are so amazing, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2026.28s)]
*  says tariffs are going to make us rich. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2029.08s)]
*  It's always a get rich quick scheme with Trump. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2031.68s)]
*  It's always... [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2033.28s)]
*  It's going to make you rich. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2033.88s)]
*  It's not going to make you rich. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2035.0800000000002s)]
*  You're never going to see this money. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2036.0800000000002s)]
*  Hate to break it to you, listeners. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  But Trump always goes, tariffs are going to make us rich. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2039.48s)]
*  We're going to get $1 trillion. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2042.48s)]
*  It's like Dr. Evil, this guy. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2044.88s)]
*  We're going to get $1 trillion from tariffs. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2046.28s)]
*  I'll say two things about the $1 trillion from the tariffs. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2049.48s)]
*  I'll say first, in the past week or so alone, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2053.28s)]
*  under Donald Trump, the stock market [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2057.48s)]
*  has already lost $10 trillion in value. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2059.68s)]
*  $10 trillion removed from the United States economy [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2062.8799999999997s)]
*  for this theoretical $1 trillion that he's talking about. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2066.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll just put that there. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2070.2799999999997s)]
*  I know it's not exactly apples to apples, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2071.08s)]
*  but I'll just say that we're already getting quite [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2072.68s)]
*  screwed by Donald Trump's plans exponentially [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2075.08s)]
*  upon that $1 trillion mark. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  Secondly, do you know where the $1 trillion comes from? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you know who's paying that $1 trillion [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  that he's talking about the United States earning? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2089.48s)]
*  You are. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2092.28s)]
*  It's not the other countries, because tariffs [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2093.48s)]
*  are a tax on American companies, and tariffs are [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2095.88s)]
*  a tax that are passed along to American consumers. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2099.08s)]
*  So every time Trump is bragging about all the money [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2101.88s)]
*  that we're going to make from these tariffs, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2104.88s)]
*  he is bragging quite literally and directly. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2106.88s)]
*  He is bragging about raising your taxes [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2110.88s)]
*  and taking your money. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2113.88s)]
*  That's what he's bragging about any time he says, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2115.88s)]
*  we're going to get rich off tariffs, to be clear. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2118.08s)]
*  Trump was in the Oval Office today with Israel's Prime [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2121.48s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2125.08s)]
*  So while the market is having these kind [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2127.08s)]
*  of massive fluctuations throughout the day [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2130.2799999999997s)]
*  after a Thursday, Friday crash, after international markets [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2132.68s)]
*  crashed, this was now the day to highlight [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2136.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's deranged and demented [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2139.68s)]
*  international policies, if you even want to call it that. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  This is where he calls Gaza an incredible piece of real estate, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2147.88s)]
*  wants to get rid of all the Palestinian people from Palestine, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2152.08s)]
*  send them to these other countries, which [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2155.88s)]
*  didn't Donald Trump also say that that was going to happen already? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2158.48s)]
*  Didn't Donald Trump also say that he had figured out [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2161.28s)]
*  all these other countries wanted that to happen? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2163.88s)]
*  Of course, he lied about that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2166.08s)]
*  I was wondering if today was going to be one of the days [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2167.6800000000003s)]
*  where he talks about the Trump Gold Card, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2170.28s)]
*  which he's selling to Russian and Chinese oligarchs [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2173.08s)]
*  for $5 million a piece. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2175.88s)]
*  By the way, should be noted that from that tariff list [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2179.08s)]
*  that Donald Trump put out, Russia was not listed on that, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2182.38s)]
*  even though, yes, there's lots of sanctions on Russia, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2186.08s)]
*  but there is still some trade. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2189.28s)]
*  You could have easily put Russia on that tariff list. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2190.58s)]
*  Russia wasn't on that list. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2193.08s)]
*  The Taliban in Afghanistan, they got an exemption [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2195.28s)]
*  to the formula applied to other countries. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2198.6800000000003s)]
*  That's a notable one right there. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2201.1800000000003s)]
*  Today was bring in Netanyahu again day. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2203.48s)]
*  Wasn't he just there like last month? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2206.28s)]
*  Bring in Netanyahu day. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2208.78s)]
*  And this is where Trump talks about owning the real estate [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2210.48s)]
*  he calls his real estate deal that he wants to do to take over [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2213.48s)]
*  and control Gaza. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2217.78s)]
*  This is what happened earlier in the day. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2218.88s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2220.28s)]
*  Thanks, Reverend, for the Times of Israel. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2220.88s)]
*  Yad Yad is fighting to get into the Golan strip. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2222.6800000000003s)]
*  I myself might be called up in a month. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2224.5800000000004s)]
*  Do you think that's the way to pressure Hamas to get to a deal? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2226.28s)]
*  Do you think blocking humanitarian aid is also an effective pressure? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2229.28s)]
*  Well, you know how I feel about the Gaza Strip. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2232.18s)]
*  I think it's an incredible piece of important real estate. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2234.18s)]
*  And I think it's something that we would be involved in. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2239.38s)]
*  But, you know, having a peace force like the United States [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2243.08s)]
*  there controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2246.68s)]
*  because right now all it is is for years and years. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2250.68s)]
*  All I hear about is killing and Hamas and problems. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2253.68s)]
*  And if you take the people, the Palestinians, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2257.48s)]
*  and move them around to different countries [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2260.08s)]
*  and you have plenty of countries that will do that [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2261.98s)]
*  and you really have a freedom, a freedom zone. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2264.58s)]
*  You call it the freedom zone, a free zone. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2268.48s)]
*  Jordi, I think that's your point. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2272.38s)]
*  Freedom zone. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2273.78s)]
*  You call it a freedom zone. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2274.58s)]
*  That's what and now you want to put, you heard what he said today [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2276.28s)]
*  in any normal times. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2280.18s)]
*  That would be a major disqualifying story, right? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2281.68s)]
*  He's calling Gaza a piece of real estate that he wants to control. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2286.78s)]
*  With American peace forces, he calls it, in a freedom zone [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2291.98s)]
*  he says that he wants to take control of. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2296.48s)]
*  By the way, of course, Donald Trump was incapable of keeping [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2299.88s)]
*  the ceasefire, you know, going that former President Biden negotiated. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2303.48s)]
*  And then this also just reminds me also, guys, of that we just kind of move away. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2308.38s)]
*  You have to like keep track of all of Donald Trump's lies [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2313.68s)]
*  with the fact also that he promised on day one [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2316.28s)]
*  there was going to be peace in Ukraine, right? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2318.58s)]
*  Donald Trump promised in 24 hours or even before he took office [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2321.98s)]
*  there would be peace in Ukraine. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2324.98s)]
*  But then, you know, like later in the week, you've got like a tax [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2326.38s)]
*  Zelensky push Russian propaganda day. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2329.38s)]
*  There's like Tank the Market Day. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2331.7799999999997s)]
*  There's Gold Card Day. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2333.58s)]
*  There's inviting Netanyahu and talking about owning Gaza. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2335.68s)]
*  He said it like the whole world on fire, this guy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2338.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, all the prompts and you could go, you know, Ukraine, Gaza economy, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2339.98s)]
*  national security, like you go through everything. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2344.38s)]
*  He's just tax on tips. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2347.88s)]
*  He's just he's destroying everything and he's not coming through [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2349.38s)]
*  with any of those other promises like like Jordi just said, the no tax on tips. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2352.28s)]
*  I mean, like like and all these done is also give Netanyahu a green light [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2356.08s)]
*  to just go through and like massacre a bunch of people. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2360.6800000000003s)]
*  So like I think it's really screwed up what we are seeing here. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2363.38s)]
*  And when we see Netanyahu in the Oval Office and they're talking about people [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2366.08s)]
*  as if they are objects, displacing them, essentially speaking about [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2369.58s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, taking people against their will, sending them to other countries. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2373.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, who have never asked for people don't want them like I like [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2378.48s)]
*  the people want to live where they live. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2382.38s)]
*  And I think just as it's so disgusting to hear him speak about this area [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2383.7799999999997s)]
*  in terms of, oh, the real estate is so great. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2387.18s)]
*  Oh, Israel really screwed up back in the day by not keeping that oceanfront property. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2389.68s)]
*  Great real estate oceanfront property. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2395.88s)]
*  We could do beautiful things like people live here, like like there are people [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2397.68s)]
*  who live here and I think it is just so just disheartening to say the least, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2400.98s)]
*  but it is stomach churning when you see him making these comments [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2405.88s)]
*  so nonchalantly and how little attention it now gets because he just says [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2409.08s)]
*  one crazy thing after the next every single day. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2412.88s)]
*  And then you want to know the two promises, Brett, that he I guess did fulfill [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2415.1800000000003s)]
*  one that Americans are going to feel pain. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2419.48s)]
*  Americans are certainly feeling pain. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  That would be he said that during the campaign trail. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2423.38s)]
*  And then what else? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2425.48s)]
*  Well, Trump never said Americans were going to feel pain. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2428.6800000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk said Americans are sorry, the de facto president, Elon Musk said. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2430.38s)]
*  Trump never said that at all, quite frankly. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2435.18s)]
*  Trump Trump said that everything on day one is going to be fixed. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2436.98s)]
*  Trump said day one, your prices are going to be lower. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2439.58s)]
*  Trump said day one Ukraine done. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2441.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump said day one, no issues in Gaza anymore. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2443.08s)]
*  Trump said day one, lower prices, lower gas, lower egg price. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2446.18s)]
*  I mean, he went through the entire list of every problem in America [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2450.08s)]
*  and said it was going to be solved on day one. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2452.7799999999997s)]
*  Instead, Americans are paying more. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2455.18s)]
*  The world is in chaos. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2457.3799999999997s)]
*  The United States is a laughing stock. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2458.58s)]
*  Nobody is traveling to this country because they are not only [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2460.48s)]
*  because they don't like Donald Trump because they are scared of being [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2463.48s)]
*  taken off the street and thrown in an El Salvadorian torture camp. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2466.58s)]
*  Like think about just that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2470.68s)]
*  That's where we are as a country right now. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2472.08s)]
*  And I don't think it's fully set into a lot of people because it's happened [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2474.48s)]
*  so quickly how quickly Donald Trump has brought the United States [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2477.08s)]
*  into this authoritarian at minimum into an authoritarian frame, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2480.98s)]
*  because I still do believe that the people here have the power. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2485.08s)]
*  And I think the people show that over the weekend at these protests. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2487.98s)]
*  And by the way, these protests are going to be bigger and bigger and bigger. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2491.08s)]
*  As we were even speaking about what for months and months now, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2494.08s)]
*  there was going to be a summer of democracy and we got to see a taste of that [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2497.28s)]
*  this spring, a spring of democracy, a democracy spring. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2500.98s)]
*  Well, we're going to see a summer democracy as what you saw over the weekend [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2504.18s)]
*  as big as that was by comparison going to make that look small. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2507.88s)]
*  But we can't lose sight of the fact that the things Donald Trump is doing [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2512.28s)]
*  by threatening judges, by threatening law firms, these law firms [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2515.88s)]
*  bending over backwards to try to help Donald Trump so that they're not punished. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2519.68s)]
*  These universities bending over backwards to appease Donald Trump. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2523.48s)]
*  These military parades that Donald Trump is doing on his birthday. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2527.68s)]
*  All of this stuff is at minimum. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2531.98s)]
*  And I know I'm certainly probably even putting it lightly here at minimum [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2534.48s)]
*  authoritarian framing is what we have in this country right now. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2538.58s)]
*  And it doesn't sit right with me. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2541.98s)]
*  This is not the America that I know. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2543.48s)]
*  And this is not the America that I want to leave behind for future generations. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2545.58s)]
*  And I think that's why we are all here fighting. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2549.88s)]
*  That's why this community is here every single day because we all know the stakes. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2552.18s)]
*  We all know how important this is and we refuse to take it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2556.08s)]
*  We refuse to bend and we refuse to cower like these media companies that we see, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2558.98s)]
*  like these colleges, like these lawyers. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2563.28s)]
*  We're not going to do that here at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2565.88s)]
*  And I know the people watching here are not going to do that as well. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2568.18s)]
*  You see what Trump cabinet members are wearing the lapel pin. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2571.88s)]
*  It's literally lapel pins of Donald Trump's face on it, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2575.98s)]
*  replacing the American flag. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2579.78s)]
*  They used to have the AR. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2581.38s)]
*  They did the American flag, then the AR-15. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2582.88s)]
*  And now, for example, the chairman of the Federal Communication Commission who [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2585.28s)]
*  regulates communications, radio, TV, internet, satellite, and cable in the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2588.88s)]
*  United States wears Trump pins on Trump's face as a pin. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2592.98s)]
*  Brett, you mentioned the Trump parade on June 14th in Washington, DC. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2598.58s)]
*  Donald Trump is preparing, this is what's being reported, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2604.18s)]
*  a military parade bringing tanks and weapons in Washington, DC. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2609.2799999999997s)]
*  The way authoritarians do that, the way Kim Jong-un does military parades. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump wanted to do this in 2018, but when there were actually military generals who [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2621.2799999999997s)]
*  were standing up to him, they said, you can't do this. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2626.18s)]
*  One, it's going to cost like $100 million. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2628.38s)]
*  Two, it's going to damage the streets. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2631.68s)]
*  And three, it's just a bad look for a democracy to do that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2634.58s)]
*  Well, Trump is planning that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2638.38s)]
*  And I think part of the reason Trump is planning that is also in response to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2640.18s)]
*  the protests that he's seen. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2644.88s)]
*  I think Trump is scared at seeing 5 million Americans show up at a protest. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2646.18s)]
*  It doesn't shock me that the timing of the announcement that that leaking was [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2651.08s)]
*  around the time that we saw Americans rise up and I think the biggest mass mobilization ever. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2655.38s)]
*  And I think conduct like that is going to just have more Americans rise up and [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2660.98s)]
*  rise up against the Trump regime as he engages in this conduct. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2665.78s)]
*  That's all we know for now about the military parades. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2670.28s)]
*  But I think Donald Trump's fully gonna go through with this thing. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2673.08s)]
*  I think it's gonna look absolutely ridiculous. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2677.38s)]
*  But you piece all of this together, the small things, the lapel pin to the kidnappings [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2679.78s)]
*  and sending people to concentration camps in El Salvador and [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2684.98s)]
*  partnering with the authoritarian leader there. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2688.78s)]
*  What Trump is doing with the tariffs which are a way to exert [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2691.78s)]
*  authoritarian power by declaring emergencies that don't exist to do [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2697.28s)]
*  end runs around Congress to make people beg him. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2703.48s)]
*  All of this in its totality is easily explainable when you realize [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2706.68s)]
*  Authoritarians want people to suffer. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2711.28s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's trying to inflict. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2713.1800000000003s)]
*  When we get back, I wanna talk more about the protests. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=2715.28s)]

*  the year was, is one of those years that they were going to do this parade. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3128.28s)]
*  It was going to cost over 90 million dollars for the parade alone and [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3130.88s)]
*  then an additional about 20 million dollars in order to fix the streets [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3134.18s)]
*  and the damage because streets in Washington DC are not designed for [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3139.38s)]
*  military planes and all this stuff to be pulled alongside it and to drive down. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3144.58s)]
*  So they were going to do it knowing that it was going to damage [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3149.58s)]
*  the streets and completely destroy the infrastructure in DC. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3152.08s)]
*  But Trump doesn't give a shit. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3155.48s)]
*  So he's going to be doing it now and it's going to be a lot of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3156.48s)]
*  waste here all for this and it will really show that will be the moment [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3158.88s)]
*  if and when he goes through with it that will really show that the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3164.58s)]
*  America of the past is gone dead not here anymore and it's going [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3168.18s)]
*  to be up to us to revive it. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3172.48s)]
*  I went to law school in Washington DC. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3174.18s)]
*  They didn't really even have the infrastructure for a snowplow. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3176.58s)]

*  streets of Washington DC going back to what you were saying also about [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3184.28s)]
*  you know, Elon Musk and you know, these oligarchs mad. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3188.28s)]
*  What's one of the biggest issues right now confronting the American [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3192.28s)]
*  people housing right the affordability of housing people are working [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3195.0800000000004s)]
*  jobs and they can't afford a house. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3199.78s)]
*  They could barely even afford to rent when they're working full-time [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3202.88s)]
*  jobs. They have to work multiple jobs just to be able to rent and [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3206.88s)]
*  they live paycheck to paycheck. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3211.48s)]
*  So if something happens they get evicted and when that happens that's [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3212.78s)]
*  like psychological torture to people and we have to recognize that. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3216.1800000000003s)]
*  So imagine if Elon, you know with all he's been with all he built [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3221.08s)]
*  imagine if the focus was on like Tesla homes, right or we're going [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3226.28s)]

*  But no, why why don't they do that? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3269.08s)]
*  Remember what I said before the authoritarian playbook here is to [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3271.48s)]
*  make people suffer suffering is not, you know, just like whatever [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3275.8799999999997s)]

*  that lawyer told the truth to the district court judge. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3885.2799999999997s)]
*  So they retaliated against the lawyer for being honest that [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3888.7799999999997s)]
*  part hasn't gotten reported a lot also what hadn't been reported [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3892.48s)]
*  a lot. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3896.2799999999997s)]
*  I give Kyle Cheney credit again for pointing this one out the [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3896.58s)]
*  United States frequently based on extradition treaties brings [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3899.98s)]
*  in MS 13 gang members into the United States who are abroad [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3905.68s)]
*  like here's a release from March 5th, which talks about an [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3912.88s)]
*  MS 13 member who is in Guatemala and on March 5th this same [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3916.08s)]
*  Justice Department reached out to the government there brought [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3921.18s)]
*  the MS 13 member into the United States to try that MS 13 gang [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3926.28s)]
*  member in the United States prison systems and put that person [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3932.48s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3936.68s)]
*  So someone who was MS 13 you bring him into the United States [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3937.68s)]
*  someone who's not MS 13 or just a baseless accusation you send [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3942.48s)]
*  that person to the concentration camp in El Salvador. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3947.58s)]
*  Now, let's talk about what the Supreme Court did the Supreme [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3950.18s)]
*  Court then today indefinitely blocked the Fourth Circuit Court [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3954.18s)]
*  of Appeal order requiring a brego Garcia to return. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3958.7799999999997s)]
*  So the Supreme Court through Chief Justice John Roberts put [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3963.48s)]
*  a stop to those orders that I just read you before which said [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3967.08s)]
*  return a brego Garcia now the Supreme Court ordered that [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3971.2799999999997s)]
*  there be, you know, pretty urgent briefing that the briefing [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3975.3799999999997s)]
*  be filed by tomorrow at 5 p.m. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3981.08s)]
*  Or if you're listening to this on Tuesday that it be filed [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3985.7799999999997s)]
*  Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern, but the court stopped the actions [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3990.2799999999997s)]
*  that said Trump regime return a brego Garcia back to the United [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3994.68s)]
*  States and we'll see ultimately what the Supreme Court rules, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=3998.7799999999997s)]
*  but Brett Geordi to your point and going back to even what [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4002.18s)]
*  that Reagan appointed judge says. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4005.2799999999997s)]
*  This is a it's not a slippery slope to authoritarianism. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4006.98s)]
*  It is authoritarianism. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4010.88s)]
*  It is here right now and the totality of everything we told [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4012.48s)]
*  you Occam's razor. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4017.1800000000003s)]
*  The simple explanation is that this is an authoritarian regime. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4018.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not a constitutional crisis. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4023.58s)]
*  We're beyond the constitutional crisis, right? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4025.78s)]
*  It is authoritarianism and now it is an authoritarian regime [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4028.38s)]
*  also cacostocracy Idiocracy that also looks more bizarre [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4033.78s)]
*  than frankly North Korea, but authoritarian regime meets [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4037.88s)]
*  the people power, right? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4041.88s)]
*  It meets the resistance. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4043.48s)]
*  It meets the opposition and meets people taking to the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4044.78s)]
*  streets 5 million people corporate media is afraid to report [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4048.48s)]
*  on it. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4052.1800000000003s)]
*  We're reporting on it here on the Midas Touch Network. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4052.48s)]
*  We're talking about the hearings that need to be held. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4055.6800000000003s)]
*  The shadow hearings being held by people like Senator Schiff [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4058.1800000000003s)]
*  and Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin pointing out what [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4061.78s)]
*  the Trump's done with the DOJ. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4065.28s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives and [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4067.28s)]
*  Senate. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4070.08s)]
*  They've given up all of their Co equal Branch Authority to [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4070.78s)]
*  Donald Trump and this authoritarian system. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4073.78s)]
*  So no one's covering those hearings. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4076.48s)]
*  We're covering those hearings here and now we're dealing [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4078.28s)]
*  with what we've seen and what's going on right now like in [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4081.38s)]
*  Belgrade, right in Budapest in Tbilisi, you know against the [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4085.18s)]
*  Putin regime. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4090.78s)]
*  We're seeing that against the Trump regime here. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4091.98s)]
*  These protests are going to grow and grow and grow and we're [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4094.98s)]
*  going to make sure we cover them every step of the way here [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4097.58s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4113.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a long description of everything, but I had to get [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4113.780000000001s)]
*  into the weeds there. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4116.08s)]
*  No, it's a good wrap of everything going on and you know, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4117.38s)]
*  there's there's a lot to be concerned about and we're not [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  here to sugarcoat things and let you know that everything's [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4123.58s)]
*  great because it clearly is not but there is a lot to be [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4125.68s)]
*  helpful for as well. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4128.58s)]
*  And this weekend brought me a lot of hope a lot of these [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4129.68s)]
*  town halls that we've seen over the past few weeks have [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4131.78s)]
*  brought me a lot of hope and finally seeing kind of Democrats [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4133.68s)]
*  step up seeing the people rise up. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4136.78s)]
*  I think it does give me a kind of a lot of confidence of going [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4139.28s)]
*  into the future that we can overcome all this but we're [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4142.68s)]
*  going to have to stay in this fight. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4145.38s)]
*  We're going to have to stay just up to date with everything [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4146.68s)]
*  that's going on make sure that we're on top of everything. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4149.38s)]
*  And so that's what we promise to do here at the Midas Touch [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4152.28s)]
*  Network and I got to thank all of you for being in it because [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4154.88s)]
*  I know times are tough. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4158.179999999999s)]
*  I know it's not fun for those who have retirement plans to [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4159.08s)]
*  check their accounts and be like what the hell is going on. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4161.58s)]
*  No, it's not fun to wake up to all this chaos, especially after [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4163.88s)]
*  years and years and years of relatively relative quiet and [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4167.58s)]
*  stability and looking at positive headlines and alliances [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4172.38s)]
*  growing and stock market records and GDP records and [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4177.08s)]
*  employment growing and new factories opening and we're not [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4181.98s)]
*  seeing that anymore. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4185.08s)]
*  We're in a totally different country that I quite frankly [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4186.28s)]
*  do not recognize at all. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4189.179999999999s)]
*  But that means that we need to double our efforts. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4191.879999999999s)]
*  That means we need to work that much harder. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NipQEMlNMdg&t=4193.58s)]
