# Zelenskyy CALLS Trump’s BLUFF and CHECKMATES HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU)
*  President Zelensky has brilliantly outmaneuvered both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me explain to you what went down. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=5.8s)]
*  So on the evening of May 11th, Putin gave this national address to Russia, where he [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=8.24s)]
*  said that he was willing to have ceasefire negotiations with Zelensky in Turkey. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=13.34s)]
*  Of course, Putin was not serious about having these ceasefire negotiations. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=19.92s)]
*  He just wanted to manipulate Donald Trump into believing he wanted ceasefire negotiations, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=24.58s)]
*  and he also wanted to try to delay sanctions from the European Union that were about to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=30.339999999999996s)]
*  be imposed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=36.099999999999994s)]
*  How do we know that Putin is not serious about having ceasefire negotiations other than the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=37.54s)]
*  most obvious that he just doesn't? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=43.62s)]
*  Well, because Zelensky has already agreed to an unconditional ceasefire while Putin continues [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=45.9s)]
*  to attack Ukraine and kill innocent Ukrainians with ballistic missiles, drones, and other [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=53.64s)]
*  weapons on a daily basis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=59.92s)]
*  So as I said, Putin wanted to manipulate Donald Trump into believing that Putin wanted to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=62.32s)]
*  have these negotiations so Donald Trump can make social media posts attacking Ukraine, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=67.4s)]
*  and he wanted to delay a sanctions package from Europe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=73.16s)]
*  And Putin was able to achieve both of those things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=76.76s)]
*  But let me then explain to you how Zelensky then counterattacked. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=79.6s)]
*  So what Zelensky did, and this is where it's brilliant, is he said, I'm willing, he said [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=84.46s)]
*  it publicly, he gave a speech, I want to show you some of that speech. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Zelensky says, I will meet with you in any city in Turkey. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, why doesn't Donald Trump join us? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=97.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, you're in the Middle East anyway, you're close enough, come to Turkey. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  I will be there on Thursday, May 15th, which is the date that Putin suggested. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=104.6s)]
*  And let's all have peace negotiations because we, Ukraine, are open to an unconditional [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire and Putin isn't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to call Putin's bluff publicly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=117.96s)]
*  And it was a brilliant execution of calling Putin's bluff and showing what's up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  Because after Zelensky said, I'm willing to meet with Putin directly, face to face, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  listen to person, Donald Trump would say, man to man, OK, let's have this meeting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=133.44s)]
*  What did Putin do? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=138.24s)]
*  Putin said, oh, this is theater. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=139.56s)]
*  This is just Ukrainian propaganda. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=142.04s)]
*  Why would we ever hold that meeting? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=144.56s)]
*  I don't know, Putin, because you said you wanted to hold that meeting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=146.4s)]
*  And this is the kind of sociopathic mindset of a Putin and a Donald Trump, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=151.18s)]
*  What they'll say is, hey, we're willing to have the meeting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=157.78s)]
*  Zelensky's like, bet, OK, let's have the meeting. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=161.28s)]
*  And then Putin's like, you want to have this meeting? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=163.72s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=165.8s)]
*  That's propaganda. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  You were the one who offered the meeting in the first place. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's methodically go through this piece by piece with the receipts right here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  So Putin gives that speech. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=177.88s)]
*  We called it out right away here on the Midas Touch Network and saying Putin ain't going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=180.08s)]
*  to do that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=183.74s)]
*  As soon as Putin gave that speech, remember the report I did? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=185.6s)]
*  I said, watch, Donald Trump's going to make a post about this very, very soon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=188.32s)]
*  What did Donald Trump do? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=193.64s)]
*  He made a post about it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=195.0s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump posted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=196.28s)]
*  He wrote on May 11th, 2025, President Putin of Russia doesn't want to have a ceasefire [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=197.6s)]
*  agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday in Turkey to negotiate a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=205.2s)]
*  possible end to this bloodbath. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine should agree to this immediately. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=212.76s)]
*  At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=214.8s)]
*  European leaders and the US will know where everything stands and can proceed accordingly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=219.44s)]
*  I'm starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who's too busy celebrating [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  the victory of World War II, which cannot have been won not even close without the United [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  States of America. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=235.28s)]
*  Have the meeting now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  So Zelensky said, sure. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=238.96s)]
*  By the way, why is Donald Trump attacking Zelensky? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=240.68s)]
*  Zelensky has agreed to an unconditional ceasefire, which Putin refuses to agree to. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=244.64s)]
*  Now, the news we were getting out of Russia was simple, was that the ceasefire that was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=250.48s)]
*  being proposed by Russia, as they had said before, would be a ceasefire in name only. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=257.8s)]
*  The Ukrainian troops were saying that fighting never paused at all regarding any of the claims [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=263.2s)]
*  of past ceasefires, and Russia continues to attack. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=269.24s)]
*  We don't have to just take the word of Ukrainian troops. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=272.52s)]
*  I mean, we see the bombs every single day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=275.4s)]
*  So with that as background, let's take a look at what happened next from Keev Insider. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=278.88s)]
*  After Zelensky calls Putin's bluff, the Russian dictator refuses to meet. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=283.48s)]
*  So let me show you here what Zelensky posted of himself. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=289.56s)]
*  This is an incredible video. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  First, let me show you here where Zelensky says, you name the city, Putin, I'll be there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=296.64s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=300.68s)]
*  We discussed with President Erdogan that I will have a meeting with him in the capital [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=301.6s)]
*  of Turkey. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  That's Ankara. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=311.88s)]
*  It will be on Thursday, the 15th. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=313.8s)]
*  We are waiting for a meeting with Putin in Turkey. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=317.88s)]
*  So that Russia does not manipulate cities and does not say that Putin is not ready to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=321.56s)]
*  fly to Ankara, but ready to fly only to Istanbul. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=328.44s)]
*  I want to immediately say that if Putin flies to Istanbul and not to the capital, I have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=332.56s)]
*  sent a signal to President Erdogan and the Turkish side is ready that President Erdogan [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=339.4s)]
*  and I will fly to Istanbul. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=347.52s)]
*  In any case, we will do everything to ensure this meeting takes place. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=350.64s)]
*  We suggested to President Trump to join. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=356.48s)]
*  I don't know the decision of the President of the United States of America, but in any [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=359.68s)]
*  case, if he confirmed his participation, I think it would give an additional push for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=364.68s)]
*  Putin to come. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=371.6s)]
*  Now here's another video of Zelensky or another clip from this interview. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=373.36s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=377.2s)]
*  What will I do if we don't have a meeting? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=378.2s)]
*  If it doesn't happen. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=380.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=382.96s)]
*  I believe this means that there will be no result in one format or another. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  Any meetings, etc. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=392.08s)]
*  Everything has gone quite deep into the issue of the ceasefire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=394.76s)]
*  Ukraine, all signals, all proposals, any moments that were proposed by various parties, countries, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  the United States, European countries and so on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=410.08s)]
*  And what remains behind the scenes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=413.76s)]
*  Ukraine has demonstrated absolute constructiveness, demonstrated that it is clear, understandable [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  and wants to end the war. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=425.68s)]
*  And he's saying Trump, let's go. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=427.72s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=429.76s)]
*  Here's another clip from that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=430.76s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  All promises, sober and clear promises of the United States of America, Europe, leaders [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  of other countries must be fulfilled. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=440.04s)]
*  Otherwise you will not force or compel Russia to take steps to one or another format of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=443.36s)]
*  the escalation. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=452.0s)]
*  Well, let's do this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=453.0s)]
*  Well, I am ready for the meeting. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=454.0s)]
*  I met with this person in 2019 in December. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  I completely understand what you're talking about. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=460.56s)]
*  The truth is on our side, but I believe that we need to make the first step, the first [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=463.12s)]
*  for the sake of the people. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=469.32s)]
*  And the whole world already supports this, primarily for Ukrainians, but for any nation, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=470.88s)]
*  everyone wants the war to end. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=479.92s)]
*  We want to agree on the beginning of the end of the war. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=482.64s)]
*  I can expect at least a strong package of sanctions from the United States of America [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=487.48s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=494.44s)]
*  And these are already sanctions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, not for aggression, not for occupation and so on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=497.76s)]
*  So there are already a million compromises, sanctions for not even wanting a ceasefire. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=502.52s)]
*  This must be the strongest sanctions package because it's about the will to end the war [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=510.32s)]
*  or not. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=515.24s)]
*  It is a clear signal that they do not want to and are not planning to end the war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=516.24s)]
*  Or on the contrary, they will demonstrate, demonstrate that they are not only with nuclear [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=522.48s)]
*  weapons are serious, but they are capable of something even without it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=528.76s)]
*  Here's one more clip from Zelensky right here that I want to show you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=533.2s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=536.16s)]
*  Also signals from China and other states that it would be fair to move toward a complete [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=537.16s)]
*  ceasefire and that during these dates from the eighth to the tenth, there should be safety [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=544.12s)]
*  in the region where many leaders, including China, will be present. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=552.2s)]
*  I would like everyone to perceive Ukraine's position as it is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=557.64s)]
*  It is not only clear and truthful. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=565.44s)]
*  If there were 10 drone strikes tonight, 10, not 100, not 200, there were 10 drone strikes. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=568.5200000000001s)]
*  So I want to say there were 10. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=578.86s)]
*  This is a decrease. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=581.12s)]
*  This does not mean there is a ceasefire, but it might mean something. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=583.16s)]
*  I don't know what. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=586.48s)]
*  It's hard for me to say. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=587.48s)]
*  And so maybe the signals from our leaders, the Europeans, maybe the signals from the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=588.68s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=596.44s)]
*  I want to tell you about our next sponsor, Stop Box. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=598.0s)]
*  I am a responsible gun owner and I use Stop Box to make sure that my firearm is secure. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=602.0s)]
*  I have a five-month-old baby girl. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=610.36s)]
*  It seems that she's getting older each day. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=613.24s)]
*  I have a number of nieces and nephews in my house and it is critical that I have the peace [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=616.08s)]
*  of mind that my firearm is safe, secure, out of their reach and that that can never be [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=621.46s)]
*  accessed while making sure that I can protect my family. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=627.92s)]
*  And one of the things that I like about Stop Box Pro is it is 100% mechanical. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=633.04s)]
*  So you never have to worry about it not working when you need it the most. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=639.74s)]
*  And I was surprised about how durable and well-made it is. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=645.14s)]
*  And also it not relying on a battery also gives me more peace of mind. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=649.86s)]
*  All Stop Box products are proudly made in the USA in their own facility. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=655.26s)]
*  Not only does this ensure the high-quality craftsmanship of every product sent out, but [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=660.98s)]
*  it does also create meaningful jobs here. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=666.7800000000001s)]
*  And you know, at the Midas Touch Network, all of our products, all of our merch are [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=669.5s)]
*  made in America as well. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=674.98s)]
*  So it's great to be supportive of an American business like Stop Box. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=676.6600000000001s)]
*  So for a limited time only, our listeners, I'm going to get a crazy deal here. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=681.0200000000001s)]

*  Now, contrast that to what Vladimir Putin has been doing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=721.88s)]
*  As Jane Keeve explains, UK, US, EU and Germany all postpone sanctions plans because Putin [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=726.8s)]
*  offered to meet in Istanbul. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=733.48s)]
*  Now the cowardly little piglet says he's going to a restaurant instead, that he's too busy [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=735.52s)]
*  and that he's just going to maybe go somewhere else on Thursday, May 15th. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=741.72s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=745.92s)]
*  Vladimir Vladilinovich, also taking the opportunity, my mom and I invite you to tell him that you [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=746.92s)]
*  are the author of all Teremok's recipes. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=751.88s)]
*  If there is a chance, we would be very happy. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=756.9200000000001s)]
*  Without any jokes or irony, I want to thank you. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  And with pleasure, really. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=760.48s)]
*  When there is an opportunity, which I hope will arise, I will definitely come to you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=762.96s)]
*  And then who knows, maybe Pavel Borisovich will not be stingy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what I'll tell you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=772.76s)]
*  We already have a tandem. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=773.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=776.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=777.0s)]
*  Now what I think is brilliant about what Zelensky did as well is said, okay Putin, you said [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=778.16s)]
*  you want to meet, you show up. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=783.16s)]
*  Don't send up your worthless minions. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=785.88s)]
*  You meet me face to face. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=787.92s)]
*  Let's look at each other, eye to eye. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=789.92s)]
*  Let's stare each other down. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=791.68s)]
*  You heard him in the clips. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=792.84s)]
*  And Donald, you get your ass over here. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=794.12s)]
*  You want to act tough like you act tough in the Oval Office? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=796.68s)]
*  You guys get your ass in Turkey and let's go. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=800.24s)]
*  Let's have conversations. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=803.6s)]
*  Zelensky says, I will meet directly with Putin in Turkey. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=805.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to meet with other members of the delegation. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=808.76s)]
*  Let's meet. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=812.92s)]
*  And Donald, you want to be a tough guy? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=813.92s)]
*  You come and meet also. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  We will all meet together. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=816.56s)]
*  Now I showed you Putin's reaction. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=819.16s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump's statement today in Saudi Arabia where he doesn't even acknowledge [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  what Zelensky was saying. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=825.68s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=827.04s)]
*  I've also been working relentlessly to end the terrible bloodshed between Russia and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=828.04s)]
*  Ukraine and very importantly, talks are being held in Turkey later this week, probably on [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=833.44s)]
*  Thursday. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=839.8800000000001s)]
*  And whenever I show these clips of Zelensky, I want to always remind us what did Donald [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=840.8800000000001s)]
*  Trump promise, though, when he was running for office right here? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=845.6s)]
*  I could show you a thousand clips like this, but I'll just show you one where Donald Trump [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=848.6800000000001s)]
*  says on day one, he will bring peace to Ukraine. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=852.5200000000001s)]
*  It'll be so easy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=857.36s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=858.36s)]
*  End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=859.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=861.7600000000001s)]
*  I know Zelensky very well. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=863.48s)]
*  I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=865.76s)]
*  It won't even take that long. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=870.96s)]
*  I will get the war ended. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=873.28s)]
*  I'll stop all of those lives from being wasted and lost. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=874.88s)]
*  And there'll be no more bombing of Ukraine. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=880.56s)]
*  There'll be no more bombing of Russia. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=883.64s)]
*  And everybody will be happy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=886.28s)]
*  It can be negotiated, I think, within 24 hours. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=888.14s)]
*  It really has to be done from the office of the president. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=892.12s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvI0g4wCHYU&t=895.0s)]
