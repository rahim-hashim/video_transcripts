# Fox News THROWS Trump UNDER BUS by Accident
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8)
*  All right, so Donald Trump's approval is plummeting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=0.0s)]
*  State regime media known as Fox needs a distraction. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=3.0s)]
*  They were attacking former President Biden's doctor who invoked the Fifth Amendment when [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=6.4s)]
*  he was called to testify before a MAGA Republican committee on Wednesday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  And all of the state regime media hosts on Fox wanted to let everybody know, if you invoke [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=18.6s)]
*  the Fifth Amendment, you are most likely guilty. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=23.84s)]
*  So here you have MAGA Republican James Comer first. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=28.2s)]
*  He goes on Fox and he says that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=31.72s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=33.4s)]
*  The witness, Dr. O'Connor, clearly wasn't going to answer any questions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=34.4s)]
*  You plead the Fifth usually when you have criminal liability. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=38.6s)]
*  And then you've got Fox propagandist Jesse Water saying it here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=41.64s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=45.28s)]
*  What's O'Connor hiding? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=46.28s)]
*  When the truth's harmless, no one hides behind the Fifth. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=47.76s)]
*  Where did I see somebody invoking the Fifth over and over and over again who's currently [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=51.72s)]
*  in charge right now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=58.4s)]
*  No, it's not former President Biden. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=59.68s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, was it Donald Trump at his deposition? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=65.68s)]
*  I have the tape. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=66.68s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Trump, I take it you are not going to answer any questions about your preparation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  today with your counsel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Should I say this or should I respond to that? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  For all of the reasons provided in my answer, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=81.08s)]
*  I decline to answer the question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=88.48s)]
*  Same answer, same answer, same answer, same answer, same answer, same answer, same answer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=91.92s)]
*  Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=100.16s)]
*  One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly by accident, by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=107.28s)]
*  mistake, such as it was a sunny and beautiful day when actually it was slightly overcast, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=115.44s)]
*  would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country because I've experienced [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=124.2s)]
*  it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=129.96s)]
*  The United States Constitution exists for this very purpose. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=130.96s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=136.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=137.44s)]
*  You know, the then Donald Trump said only the mob pleads the fifth. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=138.44s)]
*  And I'm kind of focused on what's happening right now rather than what former President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden's doctor, I'm not going to get lost in that trap. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=148.28s)]
*  But mega Republicans want to also let you know with state regime media known as Fox [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  that it was perfectly acceptable for Ted Cruz to be going on vacation while the flood was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=156.88s)]
*  taking place while the flash floods. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=164.88s)]
*  Here's what they said. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=166.52s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=167.52s)]
*  I don't understand the lack of compassion, the heartlessness, the lack of any kind of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=168.52s)]
*  dignity, love, thoughts, prayers, a dollar, lend a hand, donate something, contribute, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=173.12s)]
*  show up and help from your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=179.12s)]
*  Yes, you're on vacation with your family. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=182.76s)]
*  Good for you because you work tirelessly for weeks, if not months on that big, beautiful [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=184.44s)]
*  bill and not a single one of the same Democrats now attacking you and President Trump. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=187.96s)]
*  You should vote for that bill that would help. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=193.48s)]
*  And so the lies have to stop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=196.44s)]
*  But the sheer lack of compassion and heartlessness is something I just cannot abide, acknowledge [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  and accept. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=203.16s)]
*  Oh, you should be commended, Ted Cruz. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=204.16s)]
*  That's what Kellyanne Conway on state regime media says. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Great work. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  You deserve that vacation after the disastrous budget bill while there was a catastrophic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  flash flood in your state. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=214.48s)]
*  And it seems that you're always on vacation when these things happen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  And yes, you've ripped away Medicaid from 17 million people and you've defunded even [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  more agencies and made the United States that much more dangerous. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=223.0s)]
*  Kudos. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=225.84s)]
*  Go on vacation, Cancun Cruz. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=226.84s)]
*  He was in Europe. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=228.96s)]
*  He was in Greece during when the flash floods hit his state. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=229.96s)]
*  So then you go to this other Fox show, Will Cain's show. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=234.56s)]
*  They bring on this guest and I think they're trying to spread. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=238.28s)]
*  You tell me what they're trying to do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=242.4s)]
*  They're trying to talk about cloud seeding. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=243.48s)]
*  Because a lot of these MAGA Republicans were trying to imply that in Texas that's why you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=245.2s)]
*  have these weather events, not because of climate change and not because also of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=250.0s)]
*  unpreparedness, but because of their going to this cloud seeding is doing it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=254.56s)]
*  So here's what they were talking about on Fox here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=258.8s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=260.84s)]
*  People can listen to long-reform interviews that you have done about some of the safety [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=261.84s)]
*  and research you've done on what you use to cloud seed. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=264.7s)]
*  Now, I want you to please address a larger question, which is one that is somewhat broad [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=268.04s)]
*  and perhaps even religious. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=274.56s)]
*  But are you playing God? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=276.16s)]
*  Are you messing with things that you shouldn't be messing with when it comes to the weather? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=277.82s)]
*  I get this question all the time and I totally think it makes sense to ask it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=282.06s)]
*  My intention is to serve God. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=285.94s)]
*  I think that in Genesis 1, 26 or 28 and then throughout the Psalms and the rest of the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=288.62s)]
*  Bible, God tells us to take dominion over and steward creation both for our sake, creation's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=292.54s)]
*  itself and then to honor him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=297.5s)]
*  And so if there are droughts and we have the tools to mitigate the damage done by them [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=299.1s)]
*  for our sake and for nature itself, then we should deploy those for the sake of tending [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=303.54s)]
*  to and stewarding the world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=308.56s)]
*  And if we weren't to do that, if we were to ban cloud seeding wholesale, despite knowing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=310.12s)]
*  that it's safe, despite knowing it could help alleviate these problems, we'd be abdicating [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  our God-given responsibility to be stewards of the world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=316.94s)]
*  One of the things you could have talked about as well, as we covered here on the Midas Touch [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=319.42s)]
*  Network HATTIP for CNN for being the first to report it, is that in the first 72 hours, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=323.06s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not approve some of the critical [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=328.9s)]
*  equipment to get into Texas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security changed the approval process on equipment that anything [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=336.38s)]
*  that costs more than $100,000, Kristi Noem has to personally approve and sign off on [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=341.94s)]
*  for FEMA and they couldn't get her approvals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=348.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump was at Mar-a-Lago licking ice cream cones and playing golf. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  No, he was at Ben Minster. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=355.34s)]
*  Licking ice cream cones and playing golf. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=357.38s)]
*  He was golfing wherever he was. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=359.18s)]
*  And Kristi Noem was posting Instagram photos of herself and asking which photo is the best [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=360.18s)]
*  one should be her governor's portrait. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, going to the Larry Kudlaw show, here he is having a chat about golf. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=367.82s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=374.38s)]
*  What's your golf handicap, Senator Paul? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=375.38s)]
*  I'm a 10 and very competitive with the president. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  The president's a good golfer, but I enjoy it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=384.18s)]
*  It's a great form of exercise. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=387.3s)]
*  If you walk, you can't get in a buggy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=389.26s)]
*  You can't ride a cart. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=391.26s)]
*  You got to walk. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=392.26s)]
*  I got to get out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=393.26s)]
*  Senator Antall, you're terrific. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=395.26s)]
*  Then they bring on Ashley Moody, a MAGA Republican senator from Florida, and he or she cheerleads [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=396.82s)]
*  the political persecution, as Aaron Rupert puts it, former FBI Director James Comey and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=402.98s)]
*  former CIA Director John Brennan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=408.82s)]
*  This is a distraction from the fact that the Trump regime is now claiming the Epstein files [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=410.94s)]
*  do not exist. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=416.5s)]
*  And the way this MAGA Republican senator refers to Comey and Brennan, you have radicals roaming [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=418.42s)]
*  institutions like termites. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=424.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's the language right there of genocide. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=426.66s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=429.66s)]
*  James Comey and John Brennan, obviously no strangers to controversy here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=430.66s)]
*  What do you make of this investigation? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=434.7s)]
*  You know, look, this could be unprecedented that you have a current CIA director forwarding [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=437.06s)]
*  FBI for investigation about a prior CIA director. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=442.34s)]
*  And you know, again, I'm going to go back to the hypocrisy of the Democrats. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=446.9s)]
*  They keep talking about that Trump is bringing retribution and that he's using these institutions [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=452.14s)]
*  for political reasons. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=458.26s)]
*  This is not retribution. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  This is fumigation. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=461.09999999999997s)]
*  You've had radicals roaming in these institutions like termites, destabilizing them, weakening [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=462.7s)]
*  them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=468.62s)]
*  And when you talk about these institutions being weakened by Trump, he is fumigating [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  these. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=475.06s)]
*  He is bringing back integrity and accountability. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=476.06s)]
*  And I believe that these things should be looked at so that the American people can [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=478.3s)]
*  be restored in their and their belief in these institutions and know that they are, in fact, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=482.22s)]
*  a government of the people, not a government of a political party seeking to deliver a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=487.46s)]
*  political agenda. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=493.42s)]
*  That is not how these institutions should operate. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=494.94s)]
*  And so I commend the FBI Director Patel and the administration for taking a fresh look [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=497.46000000000004s)]
*  and considering whether accountability and some of these people need to be brought to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=502.98s)]
*  justice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=507.90000000000003s)]
*  And John Brennan, we all remember, was one of those more than 50 intel officials who [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  signed on to that letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  That obviously turned out not to be true. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=516.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're very sick, sick people. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=519.02s)]
*  These magus really disgusting people and just call it out. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  These are bad, evil human beings. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=525.22s)]
*  Who the hell talks like that? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  Then you have Kevin Hassett, who's Donald Trump's national economic adviser. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=529.46s)]
*  This guy has been wrong about everything his whole life. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=533.78s)]
*  He's the guy who said there was going to be the dot com boom was going to make the markets [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=536.78s)]
*  hit 50,000 back in 2000. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=540.82s)]
*  And then there was the dot com bubble. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  It crashed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  Kevin Hassett is literally the guy always wrong about the economy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  So it's fitting that he's now leading the economic policies of Donald Trump and he's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=549.94s)]
*  expected to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=556.12s)]
*  Here he lies and claims that all the prices of goods are going down, that everything is [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=560.3800000000001s)]
*  very cheap right now, and that we've stopped inflation. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=564.9000000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=568.34s)]
*  And they'll just eat the cost. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=569.34s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  But the second thing that we're seeing, so why is it the prices are even going down for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=571.74s)]
*  imported goods? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  It's because President Trump has highlighted how important it is for all of us to believe [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=576.3s)]
*  in an America First agenda. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=580.42s)]
*  And America First means that if you buy American, if you buy American products, then you're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=582.2199999999999s)]
*  helping yourself by getting a better product. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=586.42s)]
*  But you're also helping American communities for the people who make those products. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=588.24s)]
*  And so I think that the demand for imported goods has gone down because the president [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=591.74s)]
*  has convinced people of the benefits of buying American. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  Just ridiculous stuff right there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=598.8599999999999s)]

*  Jesse Waters, though, is very excited about the new thing that they're dangling in front [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  of the MAGA base with James Comey and John Brennan and prosecuting them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=699.06s)]
*  But he goes, I'm a little worried because we were promised the Epstein file. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  So what's going to happen? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=709.16s)]
*  Here's what Water says. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=710.16s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=711.16s)]
*  Well, that might be the predicate for these charges because it turns out these guys both [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=712.16s)]
*  knew that the Russia hoax was cooked up by Crooked and they pushed it anyway. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=717.48s)]
*  They sabotaged and spied on his campaign and tried to take down his presidency. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=722.72s)]
*  And then they got caught red handed. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  And we'll find out if there was a conspiracy or whether they lied to Congress. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=729.28s)]
*  And I hope they pay the price, but they might not because a lot of these guys skate all [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=733.84s)]
*  the time. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  So I'm not going to get my hopes up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  You saw what happened with Epstein. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, you get your hopes up and then all of a sudden, poof, everything disappears. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  So the Justice Department and the FBI have a lot riding on these prosecutions. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=745.48s)]
*  I'd like to see justice, but it's like you get guys out there that say that there's this [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=749.4000000000001s)]
*  pipe bomb at the DNC and then like whatever happened to that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=753.12s)]
*  What about the Vegas shooter? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=756.24s)]
*  Remember how suspicious that whole thing was? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  Poof, that disappears. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=759.6400000000001s)]
*  All these things always come across and then they just disappear. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=761.44s)]
*  And it's very frustrating for the American people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I said like, where did this guy go? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=766.8800000000001s)]
*  Where did that whole case go? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  Where did all the files go? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=773.6600000000001s)]
*  They just went nowhere. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=775.88s)]
*  No one even believes that. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=776.88s)]
*  So you got to go after these guys and you have to go after them hard because the American [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=777.88s)]
*  people aren't going to tolerate the corruption. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=781.88s)]
*  You got someone like Nancy Pelosi. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=783.88s)]
*  Her stock portfolio went up 40 million dollars last year. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=786.36s)]
*  That's more than any hedge fund in the United States. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=791.48s)]
*  And her husband is not even a professional investor. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=794.36s)]
*  He owns a vineyard. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=796.4s)]
*  And then Joe Biden's taken millions from the Chinese all over the table. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=797.8399999999999s)]
*  He got nothing to show for it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=801.04s)]
*  At the end of the day, he pardons his whole family and walks out the door and then his [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=803.24s)]
*  stupid doctor pleads the fifth under oath. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=807.76s)]
*  No one is going to get punished for any of this stuff. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  It just seems like Trump's people always go to jail and these Democrats and these deep [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=813.76s)]
*  state darlings always skate. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, you have a point there, Jesse. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=821.0s)]
*  And here's Donald Trump's top legal advisor, who's not a lawyer, Tom Fitton. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=824.04s)]
*  And he's pissed that there was no Epstein list. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=828.8s)]
*  Let's watch this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=830.88s)]
*  What changed? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=831.92s)]
*  I think they decided for political purposes, they didn't want to include the individuals [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=834.04s)]
*  who are on these lists and put them in the public domain. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=839.76s)]
*  And they were concerned that some of them may not have done something, warranting the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=842.92s)]
*  disclosure. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=847.76s)]
*  I mean, that's the most charitable interpretation. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=848.76s)]
*  But there is a list. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=851.8s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=852.8s)]
*  I mean, they talk about in the memo, they wrote, well, there's no incriminating client [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=853.8s)]
*  list. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=859.12s)]
*  Well, what does that mean? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=860.12s)]
*  I want the non-incriminating client list. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=861.36s)]
*  And of course, a client list is a term of art, right? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=863.88s)]
*  Where are his associates? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=866.52s)]
*  Where is the list of contacts? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=867.52s)]
*  You know, we asked under our FOIA lawsuit, Pam Bondi, give us the documents that you [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=869.96s)]
*  say you were looking at. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=874.66s)]
*  Give us documents about the release of these documents. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=875.98s)]
*  You said the FBI was obstructing the release. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=878.94s)]
*  They came back to us and said, we have nothing. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=882.08s)]
*  Then Jesse Water starts talking about how rules for men, a man should never Photoshop [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=883.84s)]
*  his picture. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=890.04s)]
*  Has this ever happened to you, Jesse? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  Me? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  Emma? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  But not me. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  She doesn't Photoshop, but she does things. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  I think. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=900.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=901.36s)]
*  Actually, she doesn't. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=902.36s)]
*  She doesn't. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=903.36s)]
*  You know how women do. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=904.36s)]
*  They do stuff. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=905.36s)]
*  Rules for men. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=906.36s)]
*  Paris. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=908.36s)]
*  A man should never Photoshop his picture ever. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=909.36s)]
*  A man who Photoshop's his picture is a woman. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  And you never shrink your hips. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=917.48s)]
*  Why is he shrinking his hips? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=919.64s)]
*  Does he have childbearing hips? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=921.52s)]
*  What is it about his hips that he's uncomfortable with? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=924.4s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=926.96s)]
*  Okay, literally all of Donald Trump's images that he uses, maybe mostly all of them, are [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=927.96s)]
*  Photoshopped AI images that aren't actually him. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=932.72s)]
*  Going to the other economic visor of Donald Trump, Peter Navarro. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=937.58s)]
*  Again, this idiot's been wrong about basically everything as well. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=943.64s)]
*  He also was in prison for contempt of Congress, and he was very intimately involved in the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=947.78s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=954.22s)]
*  Remember the Green Bay sweep, how to steal the 2020 election was his plan. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=955.22s)]
*  And here he says, look, we're given the business community certainty. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=959.3s)]
*  Everybody knows Trump's sending letters. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=963.48s)]
*  The business community totally understands what's going on with tariffs right now. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=965.36s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  These people lie about everything. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=970.8199999999999s)]
*  Again, I don't know what your political views are watching this or listening to this. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=972.9s)]
*  I don't know if you're a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=976.74s)]
*  I don't know if you don't like politics. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=980.1s)]
*  I used to not like politics. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=981.78s)]
*  I still really don't. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=983.14s)]
*  I just like people and trying to sift through all of this crap and bring you the truth. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  But what are we talking about here? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  There's clearly not certainty. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=990.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's writing letters, like, again, whatever political party you're from, put [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=994.26s)]
*  it aside. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=997.38s)]
*  We should look at this as crazy. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=998.38s)]
*  Donald Trump's writing these weirdo letters that looks like a third grader wrote them [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1000.38s)]
*  to these countries. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1004.38s)]
*  I am here. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1005.58s)]
*  Someone put it, this looks like an invitation to join a multi-level marketing scheme. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1007.5799999999999s)]
*  That's the perfect way of putting it, a multi-level marketing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1013.14s)]
*  We hereby invite you to join the wealthiest country, but we're going to have to tariff [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  you this. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1020.2199999999999s)]
*  To the Sultan of Brunei, to the, this is ridiculous. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1021.2199999999999s)]
*  Here's what Navarro says. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1024.18s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1025.8999999999999s)]
*  So do you think we are going to get clarity, say, by the end of the summer in terms of [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  what countries are paying what price, what the tariffs look like? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1031.02s)]
*  Because the uncertainty of it, he believes, and others do as well, is what's keeping some [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  businesses from investing today. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1040.78s)]
*  Well, if I were a market analyst, instead of working at the White House, it would be [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1043.1399999999999s)]
*  very simple for me to have clarity on all this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1048.54s)]
*  I would simply look at all the different countries. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1052.3799999999999s)]
*  I'd look at the size of the trade deficit that the U.S. runs with those countries. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1054.86s)]
*  And I would be able to be very easily calibrate where the optimal tariff would likely land, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1060.8200000000002s)]
*  given President Trump's insistence that we have a level playing field and that we reduce [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1067.74s)]
*  or eliminate our trade deficit for national security. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1074.66s)]
*  So I think that there's tremendous clarity right now. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1078.1000000000001s)]
*  The president has been very clear about what the goal is and how he's going to get there. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1081.1000000000001s)]
*  We had the initial reciprocal tariffs rolled back to give folks time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1088.78s)]
*  And now letters have gone out, which calibrate more. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1092.78s)]
*  So I think there's plenty of clarity. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1096.78s)]
*  And then, of course, you have Netanyahu. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1099.58s)]
*  He's got to go on Bartiroma and he goes, oh, I like Donald Trump way better than Biden. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1103.1s)]
*  Of course, it's not even close. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1109.4599999999998s)]
*  That's my impression here. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1111.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1112.74s)]
*  Did it feel very different dealing with President Trump as opposed to President Biden as well [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1113.74s)]
*  as the Democrats? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1118.38s)]
*  Is this a serious question? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1119.38s)]
*  Yeah, it has been different. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1121.38s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1125.38s)]
*  And it's been. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1126.38s)]
*  Look, I think everybody said that they wanted to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1127.38s)]
*  But it's not what you say. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1135.38s)]
*  It's what you do. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1138.38s)]
*  It's what you do. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1139.38s)]
*  And ultimately, leaders are tested by what they do. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1140.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1145.38s)]
*  And then here Netanyahu and Fox just keep saying this is what Fox is obsessed about [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1147.0200000000002s)]
*  a state regime media. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, Donald should get the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1157.1000000000001s)]
*  Give him a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1160.3000000000002s)]
*  You know about what? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1162.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, why a Nobel for what? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1163.3000000000002s)]
*  He's created more instability than ever. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1165.68s)]
*  As have you Netanyahu here play this clip. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1168.8200000000002s)]
*  On Monday, you told President Trump that you nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, that [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1171.0200000000002s)]
*  you sent a letter to the Nobel Prize committee. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1176.9s)]
*  Have you heard back? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1178.9s)]
*  Can you tell us more? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1179.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know if the letter reached them, but they now know it's on route. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1180.9s)]
*  And the reason I said that is, first of all, because he already deserves it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1183.9s)]
*  And here, Larry Kudlow, he has his thesis right here. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1187.9s)]
*  Remember I showed you Kevin Hassett before, who's wrong about everything. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1191.9s)]
*  Remember how I showed you the MAGA Republican senator from Florida calling people termites [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1194.9s)]
*  and they need to be squashed like termites or whatever the language is. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1200.9s)]
*  And here you have Larry Kudlow saying that the Fed needs to be cleansed. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1205.94s)]
*  Now, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, is somebody Donald Trump appointed. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1210.94s)]
*  Okay, he's a Trump appointee. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1215.94s)]
*  And to his credit, Jerome Powell is independent. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1217.94s)]
*  He's doing what needs to be done to try to bring down inflation, despite what Donald Trump's doing. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1220.94s)]
*  If you brought down the interest rates three points or four points as Donald Trump wants to do, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1226.94s)]
*  it's going to bankrupt America. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1232.94s)]
*  We all know it's going to happen. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1235.94s)]
*  It is going to cause massive, massive inflation. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1237.94s)]
*  Well, here's Larry Kudlow playing this clip. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1241.94s)]
*  The next Fed chair has to go toe to toe with the hundreds of Fed economists who are spurring [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1262.94s)]
*  Jay Powell on his fight against Trump's tariff and reciprocity free trade policies. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1279.94s)]
*  Also, Mr. Trump's tax cut policies. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1285.94s)]
*  Economic growth does not cause inflation. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1288.94s)]
*  Tariffs do not cause inflation. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1291.94s)]
*  As per CEA chair Stephen Myron's recent paper and even Austin Goldsby's interview, Chicago Fed president, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1293.94s)]
*  where Austin acknowledged the real world fact that exporters and U.S. companies will eat the tariffs, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbXB3p9Gm8&t=1301.94s)]
