# Fox News in PANIC MODE as Trump PLUNGES MARKETS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc)
*  Doesn't this say it all? This is what they were showing on State Regime Media on Laura Ingraham's show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=0.0s)]
*  Stay calm. This isn't 1987. Then it's a photo of the dear leader for State Regime Media, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=5.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, and then the text says, Saving Capitalism. You don't get more pathetic than that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Actually, when it comes to State Regime Media, known as Fox, you actually probably do get more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  pathetic. There really is no bottom. So what were they talking about all yesterday as Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=26.24s)]
*  once again continues to crash the markets as Donald Trump says that he's now imposing this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=31.04s)]
*  104%, maybe more, 117% when you actually adjust the tariff on China, just cripple everyone, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=36.72s)]
*  the entire global economy. Well, Fox was talking about, you guessed it, former President Biden, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=45.2s)]
*  and they brought on MAGA Republican Congresswoman Annapolina Luna, who was like, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=51.04s)]
*  we need to hold hearings about former President Biden's mental acuity because maybe all of his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=55.04s)]
*  executive orders should be voided if he has dementia. Maybe that. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=61.04s)]
*  I don't know if you remember when I forced a vote on inherent contempt on Garland for denying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=67.6s)]
*  Congress his subpoena on those her tapes, but let me tell you, Jesse, now is the time I can tell you [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=72.32s)]
*  firsthand that when you saw what happened with this auto pen gate, remember your signature, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=77.36s)]
*  even though you sign it, it's going to be a little bit different, but they found the exact [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=82.24s)]
*  same signature time and time again on many documents to include executive orders that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=84.96s)]
*  Joe Biden was issuing. So if that's the case, if he was not competent, which I believe then that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=89.28s)]
*  would make everything that he passed by EO invalid. I mean, have you seen or heard Donald Trump speak [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=94.16s)]
*  lately? By the way, when former President Biden was running things, America was expanding its [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  alliances with NATO to additional countries, join NATO. Our economy was thriving. It was a Goldilocks [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=105.6s)]
*  economy. Sixteen point two million new jobs were created. Record growth for our GDP, record low [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=111.76s)]
*  unemployment, forty thousand infrastructure projects. I didn't have to keep checking the Dow, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=118.4s)]
*  Nasdaq and S&P futures each night. Here is from state regime media, Janine Pirro, and she goes, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=123.84s)]
*  Dear leadership, she goes, Donald Trump is not panicked and neither should we, because this is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=132.96s)]
*  the golden age. Everybody here, watch this. So these tariffs are literally a transition to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=138.88s)]
*  the golden age. The man is negotiating, offering concessions to some countries. And you know what? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=144.4s)]
*  If you want to retaliate, good luck to you because Donald Trump is not panicked and neither should we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=151.28s)]
*  be because he's bringing us to the golden age, Harold. And that is the end of it. Two more days [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=158.48s)]
*  of this will be longing for the Biden day. Golden age, the golden age. Y'all are creating a great [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=162.88s)]
*  depression. You are actually not bringing manufacturing jobs to the United States, but you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=171.28s)]
*  are manufacturing a great recession. I guess when you said manufacturing, boom, you didn't mean it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  like former President Biden who actually brought a manufacturing boom. You meant manufacturing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=182.48s)]
*  a great depression. I suppose that's what you meant here. Janine Pirro says, you know what? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  We got to remember that actually everything is Biden's fault. And millenniums didn't care [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=193.6s)]
*  about their credit cards because they figured we can never afford it. I don't know what these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=200.0s)]
*  people are talking about here. Play this clip. So you know what? And let's not be so quick to forget [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=203.84s)]
*  where we were with the Biden administration with interest rates were at 7%, cost outpaced wages. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=209.04s)]
*  And the millenniums didn't care about their credit cards because they figured we could never afford [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  a house. So these tariffs are literally- As I told you, state regime media known as Fox, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  it's off the rails. It is off the rails, this coverage. Then you have Jesse Waters. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=227.04s)]
*  I got to show you, I'll show you this. I'll show you just like a minute, a minute of this. This [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  goes on for like three minutes. I'll just cut this out a minute or so. Where he's like, this is a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  brilliant plan. Let me spell it out for you. This is all part of Donald Trump's grand brilliant [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=243.36s)]
*  plan. Here, let's play for a little bit. Play the clip. And now you're seeing what Trump's trying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=248.96s)]
*  to do. He's trying to destroy China because if you break the Chinese economy, you put America back [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=252.72000000000003s)]
*  on top. The other Chinese thought they were going to overtake us. It's not going to happen if this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=258.32s)]
*  thing goes through. If you can cut off their exports, they're toast. You can't export all [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=262.48s)]
*  these cheap products here. You're definitely not going to sell them into Europe because they don't [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=268.88s)]
*  have the consumer power. And so the Chinese economy, they can't consume their own stuff [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=271.84s)]
*  because they don't have enough wealth and they don't have enough families, to be honest with you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=277.76s)]
*  And so you're going to have to lay people off and then the whole country is going to disintegrate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=282.0s)]
*  So that's a good thing. And then you're breaking China off from Russia because this Chinese [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=286.88s)]
*  economy is feeding the Russians. And right now you drop oil to $60 a barrel. So it starves the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=292.32s)]
*  Putin's war machine. And then you separate those two countries. So look what we're doing also at [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=297.84s)]
*  the same time in the Middle East. You have the Syrians now they're on our side. Their proxies [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=302.64s)]
*  now ours. And then you have carriers surrounding the Iranians. And we're saying you better negotiate, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=308.56s)]
*  not nuke up or we'll bomb, bomb, bomb. And if they can do a deal there, that's the second [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=314.56s)]
*  Russian proxy that falls. And we'll get that Iranian oil back on the world market. And it keeps the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=320.24s)]
*  price of oil going lower. We need cheap energy. And then the Europeans, they don't have another [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=325.84s)]
*  game. They have to sell here. They can't sell it anywhere else. And what you're seeing is the EU [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  trade bloc starting to break. Hungary's trying to do a bilateral deal that your English are going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=335.84s)]
*  to start trying to just negotiate directly with us. And it splits Germany from France. And then [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=341.84s)]
*  you throw in the Greenland thing. Of course. And then you throw in the NATO thing. Because right [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=348.96s)]
*  now Pete Hegseth is going, we might bring some troops home. So they're really off kilter. We've [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=353.68s)]
*  now surrounded the Chinese. They thought the Chinese were going to cut deals with the Japanese [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=359.12s)]
*  and the South Koreans didn't happen. Thought it was going to cut deals. The appearance didn't happen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  And Trump sent Hegseth down to the Panama Canal. He's saying it's ours. And we're wrestling TikTok [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=369.36s)]
*  away from that country too. Everything is moving perfectly at the same time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=376.8s)]
*  What? I just, this is how they turn the minds of their viewers into magamush. You know, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=383.44s)]
*  the KGB, the Soviets did studies on how you can create basically a climate of absolute kind of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=393.52s)]
*  how you can zombify a population with injecting fear and these lies and how you could basically [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=406.08s)]
*  try to convince them of everything. So my opinion, state regime media known as Fox, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=413.76s)]
*  they would always say, the migrants are coming to kill you. Invasion, invasion. Everyone's going to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=419.2s)]
*  die. They would repeat that over and over and over again. And so they literally kind of freak [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=425.2s)]
*  their audience out into having magamush brains where this is, they're now susceptible to this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=431.04s)]
*  crap. And I, cause I watch this, you watch this, you're like, what the hell, what Ben? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=437.44s)]
*  Wow, come on. How could this be? What were they talking? This is what they show every day. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  This episode of the Midas Touch podcast is brought to you by Graza. And yes, it's my new [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  favorite olive oil. It's fresh, never blended and comes from a single type of olive, the Pacual, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  straight out of high-end Spain, where over half the world's olive oil is made. So what makes Graza [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=456.0s)]
*  so good? First, it's single origin, which means no mystery blends, just pure flavorful oil. You [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=460.88s)]
*  could actually trust. And the packaging game changer, squeeze and spray bottles, no drippy [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=466.48s)]
*  mess, no fussy tins, just aim, squeeze, done. They've got three types, Frizzle, the newest one for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=472.08s)]
*  high heat, frying and grilling, sizzle your go-to everyday oil for sauteing or roasting, and Drizzle, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=477.76s)]
*  a bold finishing oil you'll want to put on everything. Yes, even ice cream. Don't knock [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=483.36s)]
*  until you try it. Personally, I love using Graza. It's perfect for when I'm roasting veggies, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  super clean, super flavorful, and way easier than my old olive oil setup. I've also been making some [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=493.28s)]
*  amazing salad dressings with the Drizzle oil. It's so good, so convenient. I don't think I could [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=498.56s)]
*  ever go back to anything else. So head to graza.co and use code MIDAS to get 10% off of Trio, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  which includes sizzle, Frizzle and Drizzle, and get to cook in your next chef quality meal. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Graza.co and use MIDAS, M-E-I-D-A-S. So of course, state regime media known as Fox, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=514.24s)]
*  they didn't want to talk about the markets, the fact that we're heading into a great recession [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=521.28s)]
*  or potentially a recession. So Pam Bondi, the attorney general of the United States, she's like [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  basically a Fox host now. That's what she does. And so she goes on Fox again and she like does [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=530.56s)]
*  breaking news, like as though she's a new host. She's like, so I'm breaking news that I'm going [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  to be reporting everybody. Guess what we're doing? We're pulling all non-essential funding [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=541.12s)]
*  from the main department of correction facilities because we found there to be, she goes, a giant [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=547.12s)]
*  six foot one, 240 pound guy in the woman's prison and we have to protect women prisoners. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=556.0s)]
*  So no more of that. I don't know what they're, look, what are they talking about? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=563.92s)]
*  Why are you as the AG holding press conferences about, I mean, saying breaking news here, play this clip. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=569.04s)]
*  Yeah, what's happening there is, is they're not abiding by what president Trump said. They're [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=578.0s)]
*  allowing men and women's sports. And in the case right now, what we did last night, some breaking [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=582.16s)]
*  news, we pulled all non-essential funding from the department of corrections in Maine because they [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=587.28s)]
*  were allowing a man in a woman's prison, a giant six foot one, 245 pound guy who committed a double [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  murder with a knife, stabbed his parents to death and the family dog. And he identified as a woman. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  So they were letting him be housed in a female prison. No longer. We will pull your funding. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=608.0s)]
*  We will protect women in prison. We will protect women in sports. We will protect women throughout [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=614.48s)]
*  this country. No more of that. It's unbelievable that we're, we're still dealing with this issue. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=619.76s)]
*  It seems like the American people have spoken on this issue, but the resistance campaign continues. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=627.36s)]
*  You know, one of the interesting things that Fox then does is cause they know that Donald [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=632.48s)]
*  Trump just obsessively watches Fox. So they then try to like coach him and treat him like a little [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=636.24s)]
*  baby about what he should do. And they try to like coach him. So they, so like Sean Hannity last night [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=641.84s)]
*  brought on these Magga Republican senators to try to coach Donald Trump. So like Magga Republican [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=647.84s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy is not really a Kennedy. And he has a fake, he does a fake voice. Like if you [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=654.08s)]
*  go back and watch Magga Republican Senator Kennedy from Louisiana's voice, like before he was a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=659.2s)]
*  Senator, he never liked all that. I think he just makes up a voice because they're all a bunch of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=664.32s)]
*  weirdos, these Magga Republicans, but he or he tries to give advice, play this clip. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=668.32s)]
*  All right. Senator Kennedy, last word, quick. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=672.24s)]
*  In Vietnam, Mr. President offers you zero tariff barriers, pounce on it like a ninja. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=676.16s)]
*  Pounce on it like a ninja. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=682.08s)]
*  Then he describes Donald Trump like a pit bull catching the car. Here, play this clip. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=683.2s)]
*  Three of those things with 51 votes. And that's really all it is. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=688.64s)]
*  I want to say a word though about tariffs because that's sort of the fourth leg of this stool. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=694.48s)]
*  I think most fair-minded people would agree with this. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=700.96s)]
*  Other countries have used trade barriers to take advantage of the American people and American [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=705.76s)]
*  businesses. Number two, President Trump has said enough. We would not be in a position to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=712.48s)]
*  we would not be in this situation today had he not been a pit bull. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=722.88s)]
*  Just as you hear these Magga Republicans spend all day on Fox attacking former president Biden, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is what Trump was talking about. He's like yesterday when Trump was at the National [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=735.12s)]
*  Republican Congressional Committee dinner and Trump was like, I just want everybody to kiss my [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=739.12s)]
*  ass. Just kiss my ass, everybody. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=744.16s)]
*  And the history of our country and don't let some of these politicians go around saying, you know, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=747.92s)]
*  because I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up kissing my ass. They are. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=753.36s)]
*  They are dying to make a deal. Please, please make a deal. I'll do anything. I'll do anything, sir. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=759.68s)]
*  And then I'll see some rebel Republican, you know, some guy that wants to grandstand. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=765.92s)]
*  Say, I think the Congress should take over negotiations. Let me tell you, you don't [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=771.12s)]
*  negotiate like I negotiate. You know, and there is something to me also, you know, about the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=775.44s)]
*  vulgarity of it all. I mean, we know Trump is a sexual predator, right? He's found liable [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=781.2s)]
*  for sexual assault. He's a felon. We know that about him. He's been found liable for fraud. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=785.12s)]
*  We know that about him. He's a disgusting human being. Like, there's no other way to say it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  But, you know, a vulgarity, you know, it's like, yeah, it's just the worst, like the worst person [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=794.72s)]
*  for leadership positions anyway. Then you have Annapolina Luna, who goes, they kind of tell on [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=801.44s)]
*  themselves. They're like, this is what they're, again, this is what they're spending all night [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=807.2s)]
*  talking about on Fox, right? The futures are crashing. 104% tariffs on China. You've got [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=811.84s)]
*  Donald Trump attacking Europe. Donald Trump said yesterday he was going to put tariffs on all [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=819.36s)]
*  pharmaceuticals, just killing Americans by imposing tariffs on pharmaceuticals. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=824.0s)]
*  So then they're talking about, let me tell you what's so much worse than January 6th, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=830.24s)]
*  Biden's mental state. Play this clip. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=835.12s)]
*  I did Kayleigh on last night and she said, remember how the Democrats made so much hay [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  at January 6th? They had special commissions for two years and tried to keep the Republican [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=842.0s)]
*  party on defense and just took up all this air time. And this is nothing compared to January 6th. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=847.36s)]
*  This is basically a fraud perpetrated on the entire country, on the world. He might not have [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=854.56s)]
*  even really been the president in the sense of he didn't really know what was going on. And people [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=859.92s)]
*  could have been using and executing the powers of the presidency that were never even voted for [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=864.4s)]
*  office. You know what? I look, I'll give Brett Baer some credit for this interview right here. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=869.52s)]
*  Brett Baer interviewed Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary. And Brett Baer asked [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=875.04s)]
*  a good question here. So one of the things that the data is showing, we reported about it on some [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=880.72s)]
*  of our other shows, the way the Trump regime has been trying to reduce the price of eggs, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=885.2s)]
*  they're buying eggs from foreign countries who they're tariffing at high prices. And then they're [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=892.24s)]
*  artificially suppressing the price of eggs so they can say, we brought down the price of eggs. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=899.6s)]
*  But then because of the Trump tariffs, we now have to pay tariffs on the eggs that we're bringing in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=906.16s)]
*  from other countries that we're paying more for than they're being sold for. And so all of these [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=912.56s)]
*  eggs are being sold at a massive loss. And taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for all of this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=918.24s)]
*  stuff. Let me just play this clip of Brooke Rollins and let's talk about it here. Play this clip. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=925.84s)]
*  Make that damage. Seeing what you're seeing now, do you think prices will go up? I know we talk a [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=929.92s)]
*  lot about egg prices and you've seen them go down. The weekly average price just for white, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=934.4s)]
*  large shell eggs just went up 26 cents. But you are importing a number of eggs to meet the shortage [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=941.12s)]
*  and there's like 328% for the month imported almost 450% importing more than over a year ago. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=948.72s)]
*  And obviously some of that from Turkey and Mexico is hit by a tariff now. Well, true. But what I [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  will say is this, we have been working on the egg issue. Obviously since we started a couple months [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=962.0s)]
*  ago, we released a big bold plan on A, how to combat the avian flu, B, how to deregulate under [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=966.8s)]
*  Biden's crazy overregulations out of here at a USDA that caused the prices to go up even aside [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=973.76s)]
*  from the avian flu. We saw those prices significantly decline, but while that's happening, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=979.44s)]
*  we also put forward massive repopulation. So as those egg layers were wiped out, repopulating [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=984.72s)]
*  more quickly. So we'll see the market react to that. Will those eggs be tariffed coming in from [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=990.0s)]
*  Turkey or South Korea, wherever they are? Yes, they will. But the market in America is already [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=995.68s)]
*  adjusting. So I believe that you won't see a significant increase or maybe even an increase [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1000.08s)]
*  in the price of eggs in the coming weeks that we feel pretty confident in where that is. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1005.2s)]
*  But just so you saw before, I mean, at least Brett Bear asked that question, but you know, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1010.0s)]
*  the markets are tanking, the futures are tanking, you know, situation here is not good. And then [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1013.04s)]
*  Fox is saying Trump has a plan. This is a great thing. Here are some other facts I want to talk [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1019.84s)]
*  to you about. Number one, federal spending is not down at all. Federal spending is higher. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1024.16s)]
*  Despite all of Elon Musk's doge wrecking ball to our economy, spending is higher right now than it [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1029.04s)]
*  was under former President Biden. So federal spending is off the charts. Donald Trump wants a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1036.16s)]
*  one trillion dollar military budget, one trillion dollars, he said. Elon Musk just got awarded [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1040.56s)]
*  another five point nine billion dollar contract from SpaceX. The FAA awarded him a contract. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1046.96s)]
*  Bezos got awarded a contract. This is the oligarch crap that we see in Russia. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1054.16s)]
*  Crash the economy, make people poor, make people beg, make people and foreign countries dependent [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  on Trump, hoist up oligarchs, give them the kind of contracts you get a five point nine billion [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  contract, you get a two point three billion contract and don't care about the people suffering [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1072.48s)]
*  and then have regime media fill in the gaps. That's what we're seeing. I've outlined the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOnSdVSgsc&t=1076.8000000000002s)]
