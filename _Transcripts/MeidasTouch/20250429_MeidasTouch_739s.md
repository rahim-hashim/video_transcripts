# Dem Leader DESTROYS Trump for 100 DAY FIASCO
**MeidasTouch:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E)
*  I'm joined by Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, leader Jeffries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=0.0s)]
*  I got to ask you now that we're 100 days into this Trump presidency, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=4.16s)]
*  how do you grade it? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=8.52s)]
*  The only question to be asked is whether Donald Trump should be given a D for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=10.66s)]
*  disaster or an F for failure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=15.26s)]
*  I'm going to give him an F for complete and total failure. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=18.2s)]
*  Or I'm going to give him an F for complete and total fraud. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=23.86s)]
*  I mean, do you believe that he's perpetrating a fraud right now on the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=27.2s)]
*  American people when he says, look, just give me a little more time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=31.0s)]
*  Tariffs are working so good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=34.48s)]
*  I'm going to eliminate all of your taxes because we're getting so rich. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=36.7s)]
*  And by the way, Trump gold cards, everybody. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, when he keeps doing that, doesn't that look like how he ran his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  businesses into the ground in the nineties? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=47.72s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=50.64s)]
*  We know that he bankrupted at least three different businesses, including [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=51.16s)]
*  bankrupting a casino, which is like impossible to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=54.72s)]
*  The house always wins unless the house in terms of the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=59.56s)]
*  casino is being run by Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=64.44s)]
*  Now he's actually trying to bankrupt the United States of America, crashing the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=66.52s)]
*  economy and driving us toward a recession. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=70.48s)]
*  And you are absolutely correct that the whole thing is fraudulent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=74.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and house Republicans spent all of last year on the campaign trail [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=79.56s)]
*  promising to lower costs on day one, to bring down inflation and to make life [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=85.08s)]
*  more affordable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=92.16s)]
*  That was their central promise to the American people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=93.36s)]
*  They lied. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=95.72s)]
*  There was never any intention to do it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=97.0s)]
*  And we now see that costs aren't going down. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=100.24s)]
*  They're going up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=103.32s)]
*  Tariffs are actually adding thousands of dollars of additional costs to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=104.56s)]
*  hardworking American taxpayers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=109.08s)]
*  They think that social security is a Ponzi scheme. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=112.36s)]
*  Actually, social security is not a Ponzi scheme. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration has turned into a Ponzi scheme. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  They promise one thing and they deliver a disaster. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=120.6s)]
*  And you see Donald Trump's approval is plummeting across all polls, whether it's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=125.0s)]
*  Pew, whether it's Ipsos and whether it's Fox. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=129.28s)]
*  Donald Trump now attacking the pollsters also saying they're enemies of the state. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=133.0s)]
*  Also, consumer confidence is at its lowest since COVID. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=140.96s)]
*  Even if you go back from that, a lot of these things are the lowest since these [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=146.6s)]
*  polls have been taken. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=150.96s)]
*  So it seems to be registering now, though, amongst the American people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that's what's happening? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely correct. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=157.52s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump is now the most unpopular president in terms of his public [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=158.88s)]
*  approval in the first 100 days in modern American history. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=165.08s)]
*  He broke his own record. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=170.08s)]
*  And we now have seen polling that has him in the high 30s. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=172.24s)]
*  At best, he's in the low 40s. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=178.0s)]
*  That's abysmally low. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=180.72s)]
*  But it's because the American people have seen the assault on the economy, the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  assault on Social Security, the assault on Medicaid and health care, the assault [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=186.56s)]
*  on veterans and the assault on the rule of law, the American way of life and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=191.6s)]
*  democracy itself, and the American people aren't feeling it, which is why his poll [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=197.56s)]
*  numbers are plummeting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=203.52s)]
*  And so the only question then is when will House Republicans stop being a rubber [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=205.4s)]
*  stamp for his extreme agenda? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=210.12s)]
*  We only need four Republicans in the House or four Republicans in the Senate to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=213.44s)]
*  partner with us as House Democrats or Senate Democrats, and we can stop these bad [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=218.52s)]
*  things from happening legislatively. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=224.0s)]
*  We can stop their efforts to try to jam their extreme budget down the throats of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=226.36s)]
*  the American people because House Democrats are going to stay locked in, in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  opposition to the extreme things that they are trying to do, like take away the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  health care from the American people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, you know, I'm not trying to mock Donald Trump when I say what I'm [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=241.76s)]
*  about to say, but I think it's a valid question that just needs to be asked right [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=245.76s)]
*  now after the first 100 days. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=249.72s)]
*  And do you think more needs to be discussed about his cognitive abilities? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=252.16s)]
*  And I mean this sincerely. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=256.84s)]
*  I mean, he's saying that he did 200 deals. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=258.24s)]
*  There's not 200 countries. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=261.08s)]
*  He's saying he's having conversations with world leaders and these [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=262.96s)]
*  conversations are not happening. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=266.36s)]
*  He's putting tariffs on penguins. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=268.52s)]
*  And when you see him, like you see him in Rome, whether he's sleeping at the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=271.2s)]
*  ceremony and just, you know, not following the dress code, you know, there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=277.0s)]
*  seems to be issues when I watch it just as somebody, you know, known people in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  their life, whether it's, I won't even go there, it's just, it's, there's concern [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=286.4s)]
*  there and I just don't think it's being discussed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=291.28s)]
*  I don't know what you think about that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump spent the last year and a half questioning the cognitive ability [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=295.88s)]
*  of president Joe Biden, notwithstanding many of the legislative accomplishments [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=300.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump could only wish he got over the finish line. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=304.32s)]
*  And so I think it's fair that a lot of Americans across the country that I run [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=308.0s)]
*  into are questioning whether Donald Trump is actually fit at this point to be able [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=311.28s)]
*  to carry out the duties of the United States of America in terms of being the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=317.08s)]
*  president and the commander in chief. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Then again, we know that this is someone who has spent a lifetime lying in every [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=324.72s)]
*  aspect of his life and he lies seamlessly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  And so you just wonder whether the other explanation is that some of this is just [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=337.16s)]
*  his willingness to try to consistently lie to the American people in the same [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  way that he lied about project 2025 on the campaign trail, acted like it didn't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=346.68s)]
*  exist. And then all of the extremism, all of the parade of horribles, this whole [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  flood zone strategy, which we are consistently pushing back against in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=359.36s)]
*  Congress, in courts and in communities across the country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=364.36s)]
*  But it's all centered around project 2025, which he said to the American people he [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=367.92s)]
*  was unaware of and acted like it didn't exist. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  And that, that, that, of course, fundamentally like the willingness to continue to lie [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  to the American people is quite unfortunate. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=382.36s)]
*  But the American people aren't buying it, which is why you are seeing his public [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=386.2s)]
*  approval crash. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=392.04s)]
*  And in poll after poll after poll, the generic ballot, who would the American [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  people rather have in charge? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=397.68s)]
*  Republicans in Congress who are a rubber stamp or Democrats who will be a check [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  and balance on an out of control executive branch, poll after poll after poll have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=405.6s)]
*  said we want to put Democrats in charge so you can actually do the bidding of the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=410.04s)]
*  American people, not simply bending the knee to Donald Trump, which is what the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=417.32s)]
*  Republicans in the Congress are doing right now. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=422.0s)]
*  Let's talk about what Democrats are doing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=424.64s)]
*  I think the public's responding now positively to seeing Democrats out there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=426.68s)]
*  fighting. I saw the sitting that you did with Senator Booker over the weekend, 12 [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=431.64s)]
*  hours on the Capitol Hill steps. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=435.88s)]
*  That was great. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=437.48s)]
*  Of course, Senator Booker setting the record for the longest speech on the floor [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=442.56s)]
*  I've seen Democrats being supportive of the peaceful protests taking place. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=443.8s)]
*  And of course, seeing Democrats go into town halls and red states. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=448.52s)]
*  This was a strategy that you outlined when I spoke to you a few months ago and you [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=452.88s)]
*  said, this is what we're going to be doing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=456.92s)]
*  We're seeing it be executed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=458.8s)]
*  The plan now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Can you speak to that more? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=461.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=463.36s)]
*  Thank you for that question. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=464.72s)]
*  We laid out the plan and over the last 100 days, we've been systematically [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  executing it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  And it's all anchored in the theory that more is more, that we have to continue to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=471.56s)]
*  respond by doing more, stacking one thing on top of the other. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=478.04s)]
*  So the rallies, the peaceful protests, the days of action. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=483.8s)]
*  Last two weeks, we had a Medicaid Matters Day of Action, a Social Security Day of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=488.56s)]
*  Action and a Cost of Living Week of Action. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=493.8s)]
*  And we'll continue to do that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=497.16s)]
*  We're doing hearings in the Capitol. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=499.24s)]
*  We're taking those hearings on the road. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  We're doing town hall meetings in Democratic districts and town hall meetings in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=503.88s)]
*  Republican districts since they're running away from interacting with their [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=509.36s)]
*  constituents. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=513.28s)]
*  So we're going into those districts and speaking the truth to the American people. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=513.92s)]
*  Press conferences, sit-ins, speeches on the Senate floor, like Cory Booker was [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=519.24s)]
*  able to do in historic fashion, speeches on the House floor and continuing to be [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=525.28s)]
*  present to push back against all the things. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=530.24s)]
*  More is more. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=533.8s)]
*  And as we transition from the first 100 days into the second 100 days, we'll [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  continue to elevate that type of principled opposition, which is needed, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=540.4s)]
*  while also articulating our blueprint for a better America, the things that we as [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=546.8s)]
*  Democrats will do to make life better for the American people. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=551.88s)]
*  And I'll leave this interview on this note and let you kind of speak to the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=556.4s)]
*  American people and your message right now to the American people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=561.04s)]
*  It's been a difficult 100 days, whether it's Trump violating Supreme Court orders, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=564.36s)]
*  Elon Musk and Trump's doge hostile takeover, destroying things that people [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=569.4s)]
*  really rely on, the attack on Medicaid, disastrous trade wars, people seeing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=575.48s)]
*  their 401Ks and pensions be lost. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=580.52s)]
*  As Donald Trump and his crew, what they celebrated in the Willard Hotel, the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=585.2s)]
*  announcement of a club they're calling the executive branch for rich people. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=590.84s)]
*  They pay $500,000 and you become a member of the executive. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=595.12s)]
*  It's a lot for people to process. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=598.48s)]
*  But as we are here, you and I on the 100 days, what's your message to the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=601.6s)]
*  American people right now? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=605.16s)]
*  Now, Senator Booker and I decided to sit down, just the two of us on Sunday, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=606.64s)]
*  around 6 15 a.m. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=610.8s)]
*  on the Capitol steps to have a conversation with each other and then hopefully [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=612.56s)]
*  have a conversation with the American people. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=617.56s)]
*  Hundreds of people showed up throughout the day to sit with us. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=620.52s)]
*  And in fact, millions upon millions upon millions of people were able to engage [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=625.52s)]
*  with us through the live stream that took place in solidarity with the effort. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=631.12s)]
*  We were inspired to do it based on our perspective of constantly asking the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=636.88s)]
*  question, what would John Lewis do? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=643.16s)]
*  And in this particular instance, we knew the answer when it came to trying to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=645.6s)]
*  save health care in 2017, he sat down on the Capitol steps and spoke to the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=649.12s)]
*  American people about why it was important to forcefully push back in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=655.68s)]
*  defense of what matters. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=661.68s)]
*  And so that is something that we must continue to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=664.4s)]
*  John Lewis would say to us often when you see wrongdoing taking place, never [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=667.76s)]
*  give up, never give in. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=673.76s)]
*  And that is what we are going to continue to do. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=676.72s)]
*  That's what the American people have shown over the last 100 days. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to continue to show up and stand up and speak up. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=682.88s)]
*  We will not stop fighting until we continue America's march toward a more [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=686.12s)]
*  perfect union, until we end this national nightmare, until we make sure that this [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=692.6s)]
*  is a nation truly with liberty and justice for all. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=698.4s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=703.6s)]
*  Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, 100 day message to the American people here [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=704.28s)]
*  on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=709.64s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, thank you for joining us. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-HarAsM9E&t=710.76s)]
