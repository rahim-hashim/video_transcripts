# FURIOUS Japan STRIKES BACK HARD after Trump DISRESPECT
**MeidasTouch:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc)
*  The contents of Donald Trump's letter to Japan are entirely unacceptable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=0.0s)]
*  Itsunori Unadera, policy chief for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, says during [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=6.32s)]
*  a party meeting, quote, to notify Japan, a key ally like us, with nothing more than a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=13.3s)]
*  single letter that looks like this, is extremely disrespectful, and I feel a strong sense of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=20.32s)]
*  indignation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is a terrible human being, he says. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=29.64s)]
*  Let's take a look at what Prime Minister Ashiba says. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Japan is furious. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=37.4s)]
*  Japan's Prime Minister Ashiba says, quote, efforts toward more independence from U.S. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=40.44s)]
*  reliance should be made. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=45.88s)]
*  And as Thomas Logan, who covers a lot of things in Japan, points out as well, this is happening [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=54.92s)]
*  You have Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about to have a big meeting with North [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=56.24s)]
*  Korea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=61.84s)]
*  The U.S. is screwing its ally Japan, South Korea, Australia, I mean basically every other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=62.84s)]
*  country, while Russia is fortifying its alliances. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=68.2s)]
*  How about Japan's former Prime Minister, what Japan's former Prime Minister has to say, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=72.36s)]
*  and he is equally, equally furious. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=79.28s)]
*  We cannot allow a country that seeks to impose its will through force to shape the international [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=82.64s)]
*  order. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=89.36s)]
*  That is former Prime Minister Kishida. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=90.36s)]
*  We can't have them as an ally anymore, is what they're saying. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=93.36s)]
*  As I said at the outset, Japan is absolutely furious. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=96.36s)]
*  Japan is refusing right now to back down or bow down to the United States as a result [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=101.72s)]
*  of that ridiculous tariff letter that Donald Trump sent to Japan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=108.96s)]
*  Here is Prime Minister Ishiba. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=114.36s)]
*  He's saying nothing's going to change. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we are not able to, you know, we're not going to do anything. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're not going to back down. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  These are terms that are just unacceptable for us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=124.32s)]
*  Here's what Prime Minister Ishiba has to say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=129.2s)]
*  At the current time, there are some points on which the United States and Japan cannot [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=130.2s)]
*  reach agreement, still remaining, and therefore no agreement has yet been made. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=135.16s)]
*  This is because we, as the government of Japan, have avoided making easy concessions and have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=140.16s)]
*  pursued robust talks, seeking what we ought to seek and defending what we ought to defend. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=144.92s)]
*  Take a look at what some of the newspapers are out there saying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  An editorial in the Menichi newspaper on Wednesday declared, quote, Japan must not bow to US [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=154.88s)]
*  pressure and should persistently negotiate for a revision of the unreasonably high tariff [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=163.44s)]
*  and called on Ishiba to exhibit strong leadership. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=169.8s)]
*  The left leaning Asahi newspaper published a similarly defined editorial titled, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=173.32s)]
*  Trust Trump Must Be Taught That Intimidation Will Never Work. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=179.96s)]
*  It condemned Washington's demands as, quote, self-righteous and arbitrary and urged Japanese [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=185.36s)]
*  companies to diversify export markets and backed Ishiba's refusal to capitulate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=192.0s)]
*  And it also advocated for basically leaving an alliance with the United States or dealing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  with it what it is, but not treating the US the way it used to be. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=203.72s)]
*  According to Toshimitsu Shigemura, a political science professor at Waseda University, he [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=209.48s)]
*  said that Ishiba should have realized earlier that Japan's special relationship with the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=216.64s)]
*  US is no longer intact. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Quote, the Japanese government has stuck with the idea that the US was our ally, but now [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=224.48s)]
*  it is clear that we are enemies, one of Japan's most prominent professors. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  We are enemies with the United States right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=236.76s)]
*  From the outset, Ishiba was not able to build up a close personal relationship with Trump, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  she said, in stark contrast to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously played golf [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=244.96s)]
*  with Trump, as well as Ishiba having little experience with foreign leaders in general. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=250.08s)]
*  The Japanese government has found itself in a very difficult predicament to predict the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=254.56s)]
*  behavior of the US administration or grasp why it is for the first time using threats [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=259.2s)]
*  against a partner. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=264.6s)]
*  I mean, I think I disagree a little bit there with the professor blaming Ishiba. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=265.6s)]
*  I think Shinzo Abe would have had the similar thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=270.8s)]
*  If you go and look at the polling right now, 80% to 85% of the Japanese people no longer [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=274.16s)]
*  support the United States or view the US as basically a threat or something that could [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  be a threat. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=286.56s)]
*  The reality is that I think if you back down to Trump and you sacrifice your national interests [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  to go and play golf and if you act like a puppet, I think that Japan would not be able [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=295.04s)]
*  to save face. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=302.0s)]
*  Let me know what you think. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=303.8s)]
*  If you're from Japan, put in the comments below what you think. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=304.8s)]
*  But I don't think they'd be able to be clobbered by Donald Trump and disrespected when Japan [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=308.8s)]
*  is a major trading partner of the United States and a major investor, the major investor. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=314.88s)]
*  Japan, more than any other country, invests more money into the United States than any [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=321.76s)]
*  country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=326.52s)]
*  They're literally number one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=327.52s)]
*  Japan holds more US Treasury bonds than any country by far, over a trillion dollars with [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=328.8s)]
*  I think China being next and that's like $300 billion less than what Japan holds. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=334.8s)]
*  Japan is the largest employer of Americans of any foreign country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=342.16s)]
*  About a million Americans work for Japanese companies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=346.76s)]
*  So the level of disrespect, you can't just back down. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=349.76s)]
*  And Donald Trump's just saying crazy stuff and lies. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the same thing with Trump's doing with Canada, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=356.56s)]
*  Where Donald Trump's like, we can't make a deal unless you stop sending the fentanyl. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=359.24s)]
*  So it's like we can't make a deal because Canada is not sending the fentanyl. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  That's just based on a lie. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump's like, we can't make a deal with Japan unless Japan stops tariffing American [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=367.44s)]
*  automobiles. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=373.0s)]
*  And Japan's like, we're not tariffing automobiles. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=374.0s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=376.48s)]
*  Just like, let's stick to the facts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=377.8s)]
*  Let me just show you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=379.72s)]
*  Here is how local Japanese media is talking about it when they refer to Donald Trump as [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=380.72s)]
*  a taco. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=385.88s)]
*  As a taco. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=387.56s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=388.56s)]
*  Let's dig into this article as well. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=416.64s)]
*  As Prime Minister Aishiba calls Donald Trump's latest tariff war against Japan, a battle [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=419.48s)]
*  for our national interests. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=427.48s)]
*  Tokyo says it's standing firm on trade after Donald Trump announced the 25 percent tariffs [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  with Prime Minister Aishiba vowing to do what's best for the country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=436.36s)]
*  This is a battle for our national interests. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=440.38s)]
*  We will not be taken advantage of. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=442.92s)]
*  Even if it is an ally, we must speak honestly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  We must protect what needs to be protected, is what he says. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=447.48s)]
*  Then at a campaign rally in Saigon Wednesday, Itsunori Onodera, head of the ruling Liberal [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=451.72s)]
*  Democratic Party Policy Research Council, lashed out at Trump saying Trump is a terrible [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=457.0s)]
*  person, a terrible human being. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=463.24s)]
*  His treatment of Japan is terrible. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=465.36s)]
*  As I mentioned before on a prior video, the upper house in Japan has a major election [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=469.48s)]
*  scheduled for July 20th. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=476.48s)]
*  This is why the Japanese government has canceled its meetings with the United States because [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=478.84s)]
*  they view being next to Donald Trump or showing weakness to Donald Trump would be harmful [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=485.32s)]
*  to the Liberal Democratic Party's chances. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=491.2s)]
*  They're already expected to lose some seats in that election because of what Donald Trump [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=493.84s)]
*  has done. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=498.36s)]
*  I want to remind you what the opposition party has been saying for a long time now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=499.36s)]
*  Here is a representative in the Japanese parliament. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=504.36s)]
*  This is what he said a few months back. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=508.32s)]
*  You will recall this here, play this clip. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=510.32s)]
*  What the United States is saying is completely unreasonable. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=512.2s)]
*  The logic is all over the place and there's no consistency. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=516.04s)]
*  However, when Japan negotiates regarding what they're saying, well, to put it clearly, it's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=519.24s)]
*  close to extortion by juvenile delinquents. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=525.4000000000001s)]
*  If Japan gives in and follows their unreasonable demand, saying it's negotiation or a deal, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  it will set a bad precedent and create a negative example. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  If the extorter gains money once, it's certain that they will extort again. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  The formula itself is a complete mess. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  I wasn't great at math, but if that showed up in a math exam, it would definitely score [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=550.24s)]
*  zero. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=555.8s)]
*  That's why, although Minister Akazawa is serious and capable, there is also concern about whether [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=556.8s)]
*  a serious person can handle it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=563.8s)]
*  Since they are not reasonable, they won't listen to reasonable things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=566.24s)]
*  Although I said every option, you absolutely must not provide information to an unreasonable [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  opponent. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=574.44s)]
*  If you get concessions that way, it will set a bad example. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=575.92s)]
*  Anyway, please do not give in to the extortion from the U.S., though it's really bad to say, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  but this is extortion. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=587.2199999999999s)]
*  If we listen to this, it will really become a bad example. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=589.56s)]
*  Now I will remind you as well that in the past few months, whereas former President [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=592.36s)]
*  Biden was able to bring Japan and South Korea together, Donald Trump has attacked South [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=597.8s)]
*  Korea tariffs there, tariffs on Japan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=603.56s)]
*  What's happening now is China and China's minister has been able to hold these trilateral [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=606.24s)]
*  meetings with South Korea's minister and Japan's minister. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=612.88s)]
*  This is only helping right now the Chinese. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=617.64s)]
*  You will recall that a few months back, I knew this was going to be, you've been following [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  my coverage of Japan, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=628.72s)]
*  Nobody was talking about the trade war against Japan and everyone just assumed, oh, it's [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=630.2s)]
*  going to be a deal. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  Remember, I was giving you all of the data points. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  This was from a few months back where I interviewed the former ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=639.0s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=644.32s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=645.32s)]
*  First, Japan's the number one foreign direct investor in the United States for the last [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=646.32s)]
*  four years consecutively. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=650.2s)]
*  Over a million Americans work for Japanese companies and nearly half of their investment [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  goes to manufacturing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  So we're going to be penny wise and dollar foolish here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=660.12s)]
*  Second, Japan hosts the largest military footprint the United States has anywhere in the world. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=665.4s)]
*  It's the only country that has a permanent aircraft carrier. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=671.84s)]
*  It is the long pole in our deterrence against China in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=674.64s)]
*  So nothing stays just in the economic lane. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=681.0s)]
*  It's a relationship. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=684.2s)]
*  So that means national security, diplomatic support. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=685.2s)]
*  It means political support and it means economic support and integration. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=688.56s)]
*  Second, imagine this. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=690.92s)]
*  When the United States wants to put further sanctions on China as it relates to export [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=693.52s)]
*  controls for high tech, the only way it's successful is Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Dutch [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=697.3599999999999s)]
*  stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=703.7199999999999s)]
*  They're going to think real hard about whether we should stand with the United States or [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=706.1199999999999s)]
*  allow our companies to continue to export to China. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=709.92s)]
*  Relationships don't just have one lane. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=714.16s)]
*  It's a series of things you weigh equities against each other. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=717.56s)]
*  So I think this is very short sighted in this approach. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=720.72s)]
*  There's a way you could have approached as we did in years past, both when I worked for [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=724.16s)]
*  President Clinton, we did the five pillars on trade, et cetera. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=728.04s)]
*  Japan now is the number one, as I said, number one foreign investor in the United States. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=731.24s)]
*  Nearly a million Americans work for them and of those half are in the manufacturing industrial [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=735.52s)]
*  space, the exact jobs we want in the United States. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=739.84s)]
*  And here's what he said as well. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=742.64s)]
*  Play the clip. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  China is in the middle of having it now had two meetings, both with Japan and Korea jointly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=744.52s)]
*  on both the foreign policy diplomatic front and also on the trade front. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=749.1199999999999s)]
*  So they're going to reap all the advantages that we had built between the United States, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=752.56s)]
*  Japan and Korea. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=757.4799999999999s)]
*  And so we're literally hurting not only our allies, but hurting the credibility of our [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=758.4799999999999s)]
*  deterrence against our number one threat. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=763.16s)]
*  China. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=766.2399999999999s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=767.2399999999999s)]
*  Because you negotiated that speak to that because people I talk about it on the show [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=768.4s)]
*  a lot how China is moving in and filling the void, both in terms of bricks and also reaching [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=773.44s)]
*  out outside of bricks with people and with countries that formerly allied with the U.S. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  Here's what you should note. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=785.08s)]
*  Ever since the United States in Ukraine showed a weakness and a vulnerability towards Putin. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=786.24s)]
*  That very week or two, a week later, China did an unprecedented naval exercise against [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=793.52s)]
*  Australia, our ally. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=801.36s)]
*  They had a shutdown civilian air traffic near Sydney. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=803.24s)]
*  They did it unprecedented move against Japan and the Sea of Japan. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=808.12s)]
*  They did it against Vietnam. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=812.72s)]
*  They did it in the Philippine area and they did it on Taiwan's streets. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=814.36s)]
*  So they see weakness. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=818.68s)]
*  Weakness invites aggression. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=820.72s)]
*  You have to be smart about your deterrence. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=823.04s)]
*  But it is not an accident that both while China is talking to Japan and Korea, which [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=824.96s)]
*  are very important allies, they project our power. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=831.52s)]
*  They reinforce the basic message of the United States that we are a permanent Pacific power [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=837.4s)]
*  and presence. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=841.44s)]
*  You debate long on us versus China's theory. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=842.44s)]
*  We're the rising power. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=845.8s)]
*  The United States is declining power. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=846.8s)]
*  You to get in line or we're going to get you're going to get coercion. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=847.8s)]
*  Now, finally, I will also just remind you of the August 18th, 2023 meeting that former [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=850.36s)]
*  President Biden did bringing Japan and South Korea together. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=856.16s)]
*  What contrasts between the utter buffoonery, malice, recklessness, stupidity of Donald [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=860.6s)]
*  Trump here play this clip. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=866.76s)]
*  It's the first ever standalone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=868.28s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  I can think of no better way, no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=878.5200000000001s)]
*  cooperation than meeting here at Camp David. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=883.5200000000001s)]
*  And so strengthening the ties between our democracies has long been a priority for me, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=886.8800000000001s)]
*  dating back to when I was vice president of the United States. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=892.84s)]
*  That's because our countries are stronger and the world is safer. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=896.0s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=899.72s)]
*  Our countries are stronger and the world will be safer as we stand together. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=901.36s)]
*  And I know this is a belief we all three share. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  And I want to thank you both for your political courage that brought you here. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=911.0s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to us having a great meeting, but continuing these meetings. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=915.8s)]
*  You stepped up to do the hard work that I would argue historic work to forge a foundation [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=920.8s)]
*  from which we can face the future together, the three of us together. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  And I'm deeply grateful for your leadership. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=932.0999999999999s)]
*  And I look forward to working with both of you as we begin this new era of cooperation [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=934.2s)]
*  and renew our resolve to serve as a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=939.08s)]
*  frankly, around the world as well. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=944.96s)]
*  Well there you have it right now. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=947.52s)]
*  I want to give you all the data points, be as comprehensive as possible for you. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxZU-MMvcc&t=948.52s)]
