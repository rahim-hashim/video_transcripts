# Trump has DISASTER FRIDAY AM and has MELTDOWN IN PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw)
*  Donald Trump is having a disastrous Friday. He had to run back to his safe space to play some more golf on the Tax Player Dime at Bedminster, New Jersey, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=0.0s)]
*  after threatening war in Iran and saying, evacuate Tehran now, we're going to kill you Ayatollah, and posts like that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=11.72s)]
*  And then he said, I need two weeks, I got to go and play golf. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=21.42s)]
*  The whole world thinks Donald Trump is utterly weak and pathetic, and he proves them right once again while golfing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=24.92s)]
*  Here are the types of things that he is posting right now on Friday. He's posting memes, QAnon slogans. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=32.72s)]
*  Here's what he posted. A photo of himself that says, trust the plan. What is the plan? Nothing can stop what's coming. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  OK, that sounds like a QAnon slogan. What's coming? I was the hunted and now I'm the hunter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=51.0s)]
*  Dude, you couldn't even last more than five hours at the G7 before you were so embarrassed to be there with actual world leaders who knew what they were doing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=58.12s)]
*  that you had to leave and head back to Washington, D.C. right away. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posts the following. The Golden Age. It's a photo of himself. Another meme. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=78.56s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, 45, 47, 48. We need this winning to continue. Oh, Donald, 48. Oh, you're going to be a dictator for life. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  What a funny meme to be posting on Friday. That makes you really strong, Donald, to post memes saying that you're going to be the 48th president and be a dictator. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. Really funny. And by the way, all of the MAGA supporters were echoing that today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=106.04s)]
*  So after Donald Trump said that he was going to be the 48th president by posting this, the MAGA's reacted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=112.64s)]
*  All the MAGA influencers who are having a huge say over American foreign policy, like the rapper Forgot Yo Blow and someone named Whoa something is their name. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  These people have major influence over American foreign policy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=130.28s)]
*  Here they are reacting to Donald Trump saying that he's going to be the 48th president in a post. Play this clip. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=133.52s)]
*  Trump, 228. Whoa. Whoa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=138.8s)]
*  48th president Trump. Show them your new hair. Show them your new hair. Whoa. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  And while Americans are not clear whether or not American troops are going to be sent to Iran, what's the plan? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Is the Trump regime planning regime change in Iran? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Is that going to lead to a broader regional conflagration? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=160.4s)]
*  What's happening? Donald Trump is making posts like this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=163.56s)]
*  Congratulations to Maya Lesnar on the win from Colorado State. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Great genetics. And I guess they show the photo next to her dad, who was like in the WWE or something. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=172.28s)]
*  Great genetics, Donald Trump says. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=178.4s)]
*  Then he posts a photo of a of a random woman blowing bubbles. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=181.0s)]
*  And this says, thank you so much, but the Republicans have a great party. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=185.56s)]
*  They are working hard to make America great again. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=191.28s)]
*  Exclamation point. And the photo that Donald Trump is posting and then commenting on the photo he's posting says, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=193.88s)]
*  is anyone going to tell the GOP that Trump is the only reason that they have any voters left? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Then Donald Trump makes this post, a former president, Barack Obama, kneeling next to a bunch of money. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=207.36s)]
*  And it says, we know who is responsible for Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=213.76s)]
*  You're blaming former President Obama for Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=220.0s)]
*  Like, do we all realize what a pathetic, vile piece of shit Donald Trump is? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=224.56s)]
*  And excuse my language, but when I show you that, I don't know the right word to capture what an actual piece of shit he is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Like as a human being, as a basic human being, you know, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=235.44s)]
*  He can't even stay more than a few hours with the G7 leaders because he's utterly pathetic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=240.16s)]
*  He threatens war against Iran with American troops. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=246.04s)]
*  I'm going to kill you, Ayatollah. Everybody evacuate Tehran now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=249.68s)]
*  Then he says he needs two weeks to go and play golf. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=253.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's federalizing National Guard troops, doesn't even have the resources to pay them or give them proper health care or give them pillows or beds. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  By the way, I'm not sure if you saw this, but the recent Reuters Ipsos poll came out this morning. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to show this clip because this guy, Harry Enton, on CNN, he's been spending the past two weeks saying, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump knows immigration is his best issue. This is why he's doing it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=280.2s)]
*  This is a winning issue for him. Well, Harry Enton had to eat his words this morning. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=284.16s)]
*  Here's what Harry Enton had to say. Play this clip. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=288.72s)]
*  I think we can say that Donald Trump has lost the political battle when it comes to what has happened out in Los Angeles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=291.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's net approval rating on the Los Angeles process. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=298.12s)]
*  Look at this overall. Way, way, way underwater at minus 15 points. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=300.8s)]
*  How about among independents or those who don't identify with either major party? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=305.04s)]
*  Way even lower. Look at that. Minus 24 points on the net approval rating. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=309.12s)]
*  And of course, this is happening on what should be one of Donald Trump's, in fact, the best issue for Donald Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=314.32s)]
*  Immigration. And yet, when it comes to these Los Angeles protests, 15 points underwater overall and 24 points underwater among independents. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=320.24s)]
*  No. Yeah, as we've been saying on the Midas Touch Network, it is not popular federalizing the National Guard and sending them against peaceful protesters and escalating the situations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=329.24s)]
*  Nor is it popular to send a mass Gestapo, a la the KKK. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=343.92s)]
*  Let's just call it out what it is. A mass Gestapo who's walking around our cities, going to Home Depot's, raiding street vendors who are selling food to people, going into factories and restaurants. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=350.32s)]
*  Let me share this with you as well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=365.44s)]
*  This was from our local news channel in Los Angeles, KTLA. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=367.64s)]
*  And you'll see how these masks for the international audience. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you got to be watching this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=375.24s)]
*  And I mean, for Americans, how this is happening in the United States, we have masked ICE Gestapo who run around and chase people, throw them on the ground, migrants and disappear them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=377.12s)]
*  Pregnant woman thrown to the ground. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=390.88s)]
*  Just shipped out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=393.44s)]
*  I mean, imagine the stress that's being caused here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=395.32s)]
*  Play this clip at the Home Depot on Sunset, where you have a lot of people, migrants who are there to work and contribute to our economy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=397.56s)]
*  And then there was also a lot of food vendors who would sell food to the people who would wait to work and help build homes and things like that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=407.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  Several people were running upwards. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=415.48s)]
*  Wilton's place. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=419.8s)]
*  I informed them that ICE agents were around the area. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=421.04s)]
*  They were aware of that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=426.2s)]
*  And then that's when an SUV pulled up, came out, two agents tackled down a individual with no questions. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=427.72s)]
*  They placed his face into the dirt, physically apprehended him. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=438.04s)]
*  And we reached out to officials for more details on today's raid. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=444.64s)]
*  They said while they can't comment on every single operation, these raids continue on a daily basis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=448.12s)]
*  And that today's raid was routine, routine federal immigration law enforcement operation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  You're out here. We've been seeing the gentleman who's been very emotional. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=459.08s)]
*  His wife was detained. He has no idea where she was taken. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=462.28s)]
*  But you said some of the people detained today were also your neighbors. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=464.96s)]
*  That's right. My neighbors, unfortunately, got taken. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=467.84s)]
*  They are not bad people. They are not criminals. They are hard workers. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=469.96s)]
*  They came here for a better life because that's what the United States is about. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=473.28s)]
*  Right. You have freedom. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  You come here for a better life because unfortunately, you run from countries, your own home. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=477.6s)]
*  That's not the best. Right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=482.4s)]
*  You come here looking for a better life. You come here for sanctuary. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=484.08s)]
*  You come here to think that you're going to make it out here. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=487.04s)]
*  But unfortunately, with these people coming and taking our own people, the people that constructed California, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=489.8s)]
*  the people that work for California, the people who do a lot for us. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. They're taking them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=498.56s)]
*  What are you going to do when we're not here? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=500.56s)]
*  What are you going to do when you have nobody left to work with? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=502.16s)]
*  And the woman you mentioned who was taken, she's pregnant? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=504.52s)]
*  She's actually pregnant. That's the saddest part. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=506.96s)]
*  She's pregnant. She must have been scared. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  You don't know if this is going to cause you stress to her baby. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  You don't know if she might lose the baby from. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=513.6s)]
*  What a sick regime we have here in the United States. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  You're smart enough to know when something's not working, like when you can't focus at work [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=518.68s)]
*  or when you're dragging by 2 p.m. or when your stomach feels like it's fighting you after every meal. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=523.28s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. These aren't random symptoms. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=528.6s)]
*  Your gut impacts everything from your digestion to your brain function, to your energy levels. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=531.48s)]
*  That's why we love Just Thrive probiotic. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILtDUNs_Hcw&t=537.1600000000001s)]
