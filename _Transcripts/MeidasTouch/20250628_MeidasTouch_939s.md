# SICKLY Trump CRACKS in Public as PRESSURE GROWS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8)
*  By looking at the objective data and evidence before us, it's obvious Donald Trump is falling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=0.0s)]
*  apart physically, mentally, emotionally. Since he returned from Europe, where he [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=4.96s)]
*  humiliated the United States in the Netherlands, in The Hague, at the NATO summit, he's been behaving [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=10.88s)]
*  in an extra deranged and addled fashion. He's repeatedly been posting daddy's home and selling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  daddy merch with his face on it. This is from the official White House account. America's back, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=27.68s)]
*  daddy's home. They're actually selling this stuff from the official government White House account. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=34.8s)]
*  But one of the things that Donald Trump's been doing over and over again, and if you have a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=40.56s)]
*  family member who has dementia, you may be seeing similar things. Donald Trump keeps calling women [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=44.8s)]
*  around him attractive, and he keeps saying, I think you're so beautiful, I think you're so pretty. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=52.24s)]
*  And he's saying it in all of these public settings, and he's done it repeatedly over and over again, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=58.64s)]
*  at multiple press conferences this past week. I mean, look, that's in addition to him talking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=64.08s)]
*  about having an imaginary friend, Hannah Bellector. It's in addition to him making up [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=68.72s)]
*  fake trade deals and having fake conversation with world leaders that aren't taking place. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=74.56s)]
*  And I understand corporate news wants to normalize it and say, oh, that's Trump being Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=80.08s)]
*  This is having a profoundly negative impact on our economy, on our people. It's having real [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=84.24s)]
*  consequences. I mean, on Friday, the economic data reflected the following. Core inflation spiked to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  2.7% in May. That's worse than expected. But Donald Trump and Stephen Miller, they say, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=98.8s)]
*  there's no inflation. We won. We beat inflation. It's just false. Income falls by 0.4%, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=105.52s)]
*  a sign of a recession looming. The GDP has been revised down to 0.5% in Q1. Consumer spending [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  drops to 0.1%. New home sales are down by like 15 plus percent. Mortgage rates are above 7%. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=122.16s)]
*  It is quite rare, as Justin Wolfers' economist says, for consumer spending to fall in inflation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  adjusted terms. That happened during COVID and during the financial crisis, and it's happening [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=139.6s)]
*  now. And let me just show you. This is him on Friday, where he was holding a press conference [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=145.2s)]
*  in the White House. And he turns to the woman next to him and goes, oh, you're pretty. Oh, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=152.0s)]
*  you're so pretty. I'm going to, this may not be politically correct. He are pretty. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=158.24s)]
*  Just a weird thing to say from the Oval Office to a woman next to you. I mean, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=163.36s)]
*  play this clip. She's beautiful and you are beautiful. I'm not allowed to say that, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=169.52s)]
*  that could be the end of my political career, but I said anyway. But you are beautiful and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=174.72s)]
*  you're beautiful inside. And as I mentioned, he's done this multiple times during a press [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=179.12s)]
*  conference that he had earlier in the week. He talked about a woman named Angelina, who he says, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=184.64s)]
*  Angelina, you're very pretty, Angelina. Here, play this clip. Angelina Banks from Philadelphia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=192.16s)]
*  Where's Angelina? Where is Angelina? Oh, oh, you are very pretty. And then he talked about how he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=197.92s)]
*  likes to call waitresses pretty and how he likes to say that waitresses are beautiful. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=212.96s)]
*  Just strange stuff. Here, play this clip. I don't say, I will never say good looking waitress [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=218.56s)]
*  because looks don't matter anymore. You know, in our modern society, she happened to be beautiful, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=222.96s)]
*  but I won't say that. Not sure if you saw, but when he landed back in America, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=227.36s)]
*  he struggled to get down the steps. I'll show you this right here. Let's play this clip. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=230.88s)]
*  And you may recall recently where he fell while he was trying to go up the steps. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=243.44s)]
*  I'll play you this clip right here. And when you listen to his press conferences and I [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=248.72s)]
*  I guess, unfortunately for me, I watch them all so I can just show you what's going down. And I do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=258.56s)]
*  longer takes on it. So if you wanted to have more context, you can go back and watch. I mean, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=264.24s)]
*  I just show you a few of these clips because they're each one's more insane than the next. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  But like he talks about paper clips and he's like someone invented paper clips and they got very [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  rich off of paper clips here. Play this clip. And people said, what a great idea. It's so simple. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=279.68s)]
*  It's like, it's like the paper clip. Somebody came up with the idea of a paper clip many years ago, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  1817, and he became a very rich person. And everybody looked at it and said, why the hell [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=288.72s)]
*  didn't I think of that? But it's like the paper clip, but only if the car is made in America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=294.56s)]
*  Remember that. And again, like what in the world is he talking about here? So then on Friday, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=299.6s)]
*  he mentions that he bashes Canada again. He says the United States is pulling out of all [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=305.52s)]
*  trade negotiations with Canada. He goes, we've just been informed that Canada, a very difficult [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=313.76s)]
*  country to trade with, including the fact that they've charged our farmers as much as a 400% [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=320.64s)]
*  tariff for years on dairy products, has just announced that they are putting a digital service [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=326.24s)]
*  tax on our American technology companies. Then Donald Trump basically says, this is egregious. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=331.52s)]
*  We're terminating all trade discussions with Canada. If he just lived in the real world, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=337.6s)]
*  he would know that what he's referring to, I think the digital service tax act from Canada [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=345.44s)]
*  came into law in 2024. No one was complaining about this thing. Really American farmers [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=352.88s)]
*  are not complaining about competing with Canada's dairy farmers. That's just not what's happening. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=360.8s)]
*  American farmers are getting screwed because the retaliatory tariffs placed on the United States [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=369.84s)]
*  now have places like Canada and China elsewhere going to Brazil and places in Central America [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  and South America to get their stuff. But what in the world is he talking about here? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=384.64s)]
*  I think this is important also as we learn more details how these strikes on Iran were [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=391.84s)]
*  not successful objectively. Iran's able to still have nuclear capabilities. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=398.88s)]
*  And in a few months, if they wanted to potentially have a nuclear weapon, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=406.08s)]
*  Iran is now no longer cooperating at all with the IAEA as a result of what went down. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  They're declaring victory in Iran, although not a victory in Iran, but their people are [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=418.56s)]
*  celebrating and acting like they won. I think they were able to move their uranium [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=423.84s)]
*  out before the strikes took place. Donald Trump is talking about a deal that he's encouraging [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=428.4s)]
*  China to buy cheap oil from Iran. And ultimately, who's that going to benefit? Ultimately, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  it's going to benefit Vladimir Putin who gets the Shahid drones from Iran. I mean, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=441.2s)]
*  that's the alliance Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea. We learned this fact as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=445.76s)]
*  The United States depleted 15 to 20% of its THAAD, T-H-A-A-D, Missile Interceptor Stockpile. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  That is just an acronym for the missiles that were used to kind of shoot down the ballistic missiles [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  and the other rockets from Iran. So during the 11-day Israel-Iran conflict, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=470.72s)]
*  the United States spent close to a billion dollars and depleted 15 to 20% of the THAAD [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=477.2s)]
*  missile interceptors. That's not a good fact. That's not a good stat right there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=485.36s)]
*  Donald Trump talking about a made-up deal with China that didn't take place. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=492.8s)]
*  We just signed a deal with China yesterday, he said on Thursday. So that would be Wednesday. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=497.36s)]
*  There's no deal with China. He's making this up. Like, what are you talking about? And now, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=503.28s)]
*  everybody from the Trump regime is saying, well, we should wait for Labor Day. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Labor Day, there's going to be deals. Here's Donald Trump talking about, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=513.36s)]
*  we just signed with China yesterday. Play this clip. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=516.8s)]
*  Everybody wants to make a deal and have a part of it, right? I know you and Howard and Scott are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  working overtime making deals with other countries. You remember a few months ago, the press was saying, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=525.12s)]
*  do you really have anybody of any interest? Well, we just signed with China yesterday, right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=532.48s)]
*  Just signed with China. We have everybody. We're not going to make deals with everybody. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=538.16s)]
*  Some were just going to send them a letter, say, thank you very much. You're going to pay 25%, 35%, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=542.32s)]
*  45%. That's the easy way to do it. And my people don't want to do it that way. They want to do some [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=546.24s)]
*  of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do. But we're having some great deals. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=551.76s)]
*  We have one coming up, maybe with India, very big one. Well, we're going to open up India. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  And now here's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushing the benchmark down the line and saying, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=560.4s)]
*  maybe by Labor Day we'll have deals. And it doesn't really matter. Donald Trump will just [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  send letters to countries and he'll tell them what the tariffs are going to be. Here, play this clip. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=571.52s)]
*  What is the next country we should expect a trade deal to do with the United States? Are you going [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=576.64s)]
*  to be able to get some deal announcements beyond just the UK before this August deadline, where [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=581.84s)]
*  we're going to hear from the Court of International Apparitions? Maria, with all things, they get done [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=588.16s)]
*  at the end. You have to put on a deadline. As you and I know, nothing gets done in Washington [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=595.68s)]
*  well in advance. So I think a lot of the countries are feeling pressure. As President Trump has said, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=603.52s)]
*  he's created maximum negotiating leverage for Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick, and myself [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=610.0s)]
*  by saying, if you can't get to a deal, he's happy to go back to the April 2nd level. So we have [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=615.76s)]
*  countries approaching us with very good deals. We have 18 important trading partners. UK, China, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=623.6s)]
*  they are behind us for now, are behind us. And then Secretary Lutnick said yesterday [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=631.6s)]
*  that he expects 10 more deals. So if we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  there are another important 20 relationships, then I think we could have trade wrapped up by [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=647.36s)]
*  Labor Day. So we will have taxes and trade, which I think will provide a great stimulus [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=654.32s)]
*  from the economy. And then there's the deregulatory impact. You know, Trump continues to say that gas [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=662.0s)]
*  is a dollar 98 cents when it's not a dollar 98 cents. I mean, just think about that. I mean, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=669.12s)]
*  if I said former President Biden claimed gas was a dollar 98 and it wasn't, you'd all be like, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=675.44s)]
*  okay, Biden's got dementia. Just think about the way the media would report this. But [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  here's what Trump says about gasoline. Energy prices are way down. Gasoline now is [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=686.24s)]
*  down to close to $2 in a lot of places. A couple of places I see it even broke. It's like $1.98 a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=691.2s)]
*  gallon. We've done a great job on inflation and honestly, pretty much everything else. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=696.96s)]
*  You know, and I think this moment right here from Donald Trump's press conference on Friday was the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=702.64s)]
*  most telling because you could really see what sheeple, what sheep the media is and that they're [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=708.24s)]
*  willing to throw away our democracy for access to this cognitively addled, physically decaying, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=713.6s)]
*  dangerous dictator who's destroyed our constitution. So like Donald Trump says, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=720.64s)]
*  all right, who wants to ask me more questions or should I leave? Do you want me to leave or do you [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=727.36s)]
*  want me to stay? And then everybody in the media was like, stay, stay, stay, please stay, stay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=732.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really embarrassing. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  So many questions. Should we keep this going? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=741.76s)]
*  This is the opposite of Biden. Biden would take a half a question and he'd leave without answering. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=748.08s)]
*  You tell me when it gets boring. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=756.48s)]
*  I think that right there is a perfect microcosm of the media giving us all the middle finger. Stay, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=760.32s)]
*  stay, stay, stay, stay. You know what? On right wing media, they're still talking about former [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=766.08s)]
*  president Biden. Oh, you still have like a Jake Tapper going around. Did you know that Biden? Dude, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=772.0s)]
*  shut up. We can see Donald Trump before our eyes behaving the way he did. This is from [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  agingcare.com. While some of the inappropriate things that come out of dementia patients' mouths [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=789.5200000000001s)]
*  tend to be off the wall or even comical, other comments are deeply hurtful to those around them. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=795.84s)]
*  These remarks are the product of interacting with the world as usual, but without any social filters. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=802.08s)]
*  A senior with cognitive impairment, for example, may comment on a person's attractiveness, weight, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=808.32s)]
*  clothing, accent, or even race. And I mean, here Donald Trump keeps talking about his imaginary [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  friend Hannibal Lecter. Here, watch this. During the campaign, I talk about the late great Hannibal [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=821.2s)]
*  Lecter. Do you know who that is? Hannibal. Silence of the lambs. I talk about in the fake news would [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=826.24s)]
*  go crazy. Why does he keep mentioning? Well, because we want in the landslide. That's why [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  they don't want to have Hannibal in our midst. So I think it's important that I point this out, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=837.6s)]
*  that we discuss the meltdown that's taking place. And also, we attach it to the real world [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=846.64s)]
*  consequences. How is this also impacting you? It's impacting you because inflation's real. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  It's happening. It's going up. Core inflation's up 2.7% in May. That's higher than expected. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=860.4s)]
*  So Trump lied about making things cheaper. And he'll say, oh, in the big bill, there's no tax on [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=867.28s)]
*  Social Security. That's not true. It's not in there at all. It's just a lie. It's just a lie. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=873.68s)]
*  Housing is certainly less affordable right now. We've got ICE agents disappearing, people on the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=878.64s)]
*  streets. It's bad out there. It's bad out there. Our economy's contracting. People are being laid [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=885.76s)]
*  off. That's the reality. And then you have this right wing MAGA cult trying to pretend that, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=893.3599999999999s)]
*  oh, daddy's home, daddy. Daddy? This is the United's daddy? Calling the president daddy? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=900.16s)]
*  This is some weird stuff. And it's not normal. It's not acceptable. We're not going to normalize [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_N2Ovme2r8&t=910.4s)]
