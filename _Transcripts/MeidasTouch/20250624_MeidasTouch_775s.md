# Dem Governor TEARS Trump TO PIECES in MAJOR SPEECH
**MeidasTouch:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI)
*  Democratic governors are ripping Donald Trump and Trumpism to shreds, not just with their powerful words and speeches, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=0.0s)]
*  but through their actions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=8.24s)]
*  Democratic governors are showing that you can have a balanced budget, a fiscally responsible state, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=10.24s)]
*  while making sure that the government delivers for the people, protects the people, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=17.84s)]
*  stands up for the people, and isn't used to intimidate, bully, threaten, and harass the people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=24.0s)]
*  You see, government should be a tool, call me old-fashioned for this one, to actually help people, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=30.64s)]
*  and not be a tool to help the billionaires and decamillionaires gain unfair advantages, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=37.76s)]
*  to get richer and screw over and torture the rest of us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Now, Democratic Governor Pritzker from Illinois, I think, has been a great example of how you have a fiscally responsible budget, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=48.8s)]
*  how you stand up for the people in your state, how you forcefully push back against Trumpism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=59.52s)]
*  I want to share with you a speech that he just gave, where he brought the House down, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=65.44s)]
*  where he talks about the budget that he has introduced, that he is running in Illinois. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=71.04s)]
*  And he has contrasted that with the abomination that is the disastrous Trump MAGA budget bill. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=77.76s)]
*  Let me show you this clip. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  So, continues our investments in quality child care, modernizing roads and bridges, and expanding job training. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=87.44s)]
*  That's hard to do while balancing the budget, but we did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=95.2s)]
*  Not everyone can say that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=100.4s)]
*  The Trump administration is spending wildly on tax cuts for their wealthy friends, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=102.56s)]
*  while the Republicans in Congress are voting to gut health care and food assistance for working parents, for seniors, and children. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=107.36s)]
*  The Trump slump is affecting the entire nation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=117.12s)]
*  Our neighbors in Iowa are dipping into their rainy day fund, and Indiana is making major cuts to higher education and health care. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=120.4s)]
*  While the Trump administration goes on Fox News lying about being fiscally responsible, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=130.24s)]
*  Illinois is showing a better way, balancing the budget while maintaining the programs that most people rely on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=135.52s)]
*  With rising gas prices across the nation and Trump tariffs taking a bite out of everyone's wallets, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  our General Assembly and I are working together to make life more affordable for working families. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's another incredible clip from that speech by Governor Pritzker. Let's play it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=156.88s)]
*  Here's a clip from that speech by Governor Pritzker. Let's play it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=186.88s)]
*  Here's another incredible speech, another clip from that incredible speech by Pritzker. Let's play it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  After decades of budget mismanagement, we are doing the hard work of crafting balanced budgets year after year. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=222.56s)]
*  This year, that task was made harder by the turbulent national economic conditions and unstable federal funds flow [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  caused by the chaos and ineptitude of the Trump administration. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  Despite that, the budget maintains core investments for Illinois' families without raising their taxes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=243.44s)]
*  In a year when revenues are expected to increase by 3.5%, we reigned in our discretionary spending to a less than 1% increase. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=251.04s)]
*  If you compare Illinois' budgets to Trump's budgets during my time in office, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=262.8s)]
*  Illinois' budgets have grown at a rate that is 25% lower than Trump's. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=268.56s)]
*  Fiscal responsibility has defined our work with the Illinois General Assembly since my first day in office. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=274.56s)]
*  Since then, Illinois has secured nine credit upgrades from S&P and Moody's and Fitch, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  taking us back to A-level ratings. Our pension funded ratio is now improving every year, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  and the rainy day fund is at record highs. Illinois' progress is real, and the financial bond houses have noticed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=294.88s)]
*  When it comes to responsible fiscal stewardship, we're not resting on our laurels, though. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=303.36s)]
*  This budget addresses the Tier 2 pension social security safe harbor fix, which will now begin in FY26. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=309.12s)]
*  For a third time since I took office, we are funding above the required pension payment [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  to create a $75 million reserve fund for the expected costs associated with maintaining the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  social security wage base. With this fix going into effect, we're protecting our taxpayers and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=333.76s)]
*  state workers from future shortfalls that could cost the state much more. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=341.12s)]
*  I'm joined by Ofer Eskel, Senior Strategist at the Democratic Governors Association. Ofer, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=347.04s)]
*  I just was showing some clips there of Governor Pritzker, and I could show a lot of other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=353.44s)]
*  Democratic governors giving similar speeches about their budgets, but emphasizing fiscal responsibility, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  balanced budgets, no deficits, while investing in health care, while focusing on people's pensions, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=366.96s)]
*  while focusing on actually improving people's lives. What a concept that that's what Democratic [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  governors are focused on, huh? Well, we like to say the DGA, Democratic Governors, get stuff done, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=382.96s)]
*  and I think Governor Pritzker is a great example of that, and you left this off, Ben, off the very [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  long list of stuff that he covered, but I think the credit rating of Illinois has gone up several [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=392.8s)]
*  times over as he's been governor because he's been a good steward of the economy there, and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=397.68s)]
*  it's not just balancing budgets, it's also creating jobs, and I think I could go down the list. I like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=403.04s)]
*  to call Josh Shapiro, Job Shapiro, because of all the big announcements he's got in Pennsylvania, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=408.16s)]
*  but they really are focused on these kitchen table issues and how they can deliver for people, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=412.48s)]
*  whether that's funding your schools or fixing your roads or making sure that you have a good [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=417.36s)]
*  quality job and staying in your state makes sense. So, Democratic governors really do get stuff done, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=422.32s)]
*  and I think right now we're feeling that who your governor is, is never mattered more, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=427.04s)]
*  and that's just a case in point. Right, I mean, I think it's also a difference of, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=431.36s)]
*  are you performing your job for the people? Are you performing your job for the cameras or for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump? And what you see in all of these red states, it is this performative, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=442.24s)]
*  MAGA cosplay ritual. It reminds me of playing dress up, and they all go to their MAGA festival, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=447.6s)]
*  and they all pledge allegiance to Donald Trump, and all right, what's our new MAGA catchphrase [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=459.52s)]
*  today? And it's just to me so divorced from what's going on in the ground. So talk to us, though, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=465.2s)]
*  about performing for the people and actually delivering and what that kind of, I think, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=470.32s)]
*  generalizations you can make about the messages coming from Democratic governors across the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=476.48s)]
*  country. Well, I think why we have so many Democratic governors this time is because they're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=480.48s)]
*  in their communities and they're hearing from the people they serve about what's on their minds, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=484.8s)]
*  and then they're taking action to fix that. And I think it's a shame really when you see [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  it come down to party lines speaking up about what's right. And this Republican [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  bill in the Senate right now that would gut Medicaid and hurt SNAP, something that hurt [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=498.56s)]
*  every governor in this country, not just Democratic governors and Republican ones, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=504.48s)]
*  seems like it's kind of splitting down party lines. And we've had Democratic governors on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=508.56s)]
*  our side stand up in unison and say, hey, this doesn't work. We can't backfill these cuts. It's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=512.88s)]
*  going to really hurt people in our states, but Republican governors stay mute. And I think that's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=517.76s)]
*  a great example of the contrast here. And not to get ahead of you, Ben, but I think that's what's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=522.4s)]
*  on the line for these two governors races that we have this year in Virginia and New Jersey, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=527.04s)]
*  where both of the Republican candidates are also a cut of the same cloth, seem really reluctant to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=531.36s)]
*  have any daylight between them and the Trump administration, even when it will hurt the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  states that they're in. And I think electing an executive like Abigail Spenberger in Virginia or [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  Mikey Sherrill in New Jersey, who will fight for what's right, but also continue focusing on these [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=546.56s)]
*  kitchen table issues that we're hearing time and time again, or what's on voters minds. And [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=552.24s)]
*  frankly, what Trump said he would deliver on day one and seems to be backing off that promise. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=556.56s)]
*  Let's talk about that. A lot of people are focusing on midterms or at least their minds [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=561.92s)]
*  on these midterms couldn't come any sooner, but we've got big governors races right now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned Virginia and New Jersey. Talk about the candidates there and talk about why people [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=572.64s)]
*  really need to start focusing on this right now. Well, we like to say there's no such thing as [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=578.64s)]
*  off years of the DGA, but we do have two off year governor's races this year, Virginia and New [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=582.72s)]
*  Jersey. And some reporters like to look at them as kind of an indicator of how people are feeling [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  about what's going on in the country. And I think Virginia is a really great example for us to flip [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=592.24s)]
*  a state from red to blue. Glenn Young is the governor there now, but we feel really good [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=598.64s)]
*  about the campaign that Abigail Spenberger is running. She's our, or officially in the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=603.36s)]
*  general election there, the whole ticket set and they're currently together in unity talking about [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=607.36s)]
*  how they're going to deliver for Virginians on a bus tour that they're on and talking about again, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=613.36s)]
*  these kitchen table issues and Abigail Spenberger's laser focused on that has rolled out an [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=619.12s)]
*  affordability plan that would lower costs on healthcare, housing, energy. And on the other [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=623.6s)]
*  side of the coin in New Jersey, Mikey Sherrill is officially our candidate in the general election [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=629.44s)]
*  there. Really looking forward to her facing off with Jack Cittarelli, who's a two-time loser and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=634.0s)]
*  we think she'll make him a three-time loser. But she's a former Navy helicopter pilot. She currently [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=638.4s)]
*  is a member of Congress and people might remember that she flipped a traditionally red district in [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=644.8s)]
*  New Jersey from red to blue. And she has a real record of delivering on these kitchen table issues. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=649.2s)]
*  Again, she's fought to lower prescription drug costs. She's created jobs. She's focused on [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=654.56s)]
*  infrastructure, but she's also been a fighter for fundamental freedoms like abortion rights. So [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=659.04s)]
*  I think that's a really strong matchup in the general election. Looking forward to keeping New [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=663.84s)]
*  Jersey blue. And if we do that with Mikey Sherrill, we'll also have the opportunity to make some [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  history. It'll be the first time in, I think, 60 years that we've elected a Democrat in Trenon [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=673.12s)]
*  for three consecutive terms. So if folks watching now are looking for something to do and channel [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=677.76s)]
*  your energy into, these two off-year governor's races are a really big one that can send a message [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  about where we are as a party and that we're really heading on offense into the midterms. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  We'll have 36 governor's races on our very big map. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6YgFqCk8gI&t=692.64s)]
