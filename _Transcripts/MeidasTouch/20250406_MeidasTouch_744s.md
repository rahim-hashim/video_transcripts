# Trump’s Tariffs Plan BLOWS UP in His Face…Dems FIGHT BACK
**MeidasTouch:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI)
*  The markets absolutely crashed on Friday once again. The Dow was down 2200 points, the S&P down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=0.0s)]
*  322 points, the Nasdaq down 962 points. And of course, this follows another horrific day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  On Thursday, Donald Trump sent his propagandist from the regime out on Fox to give these very [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  bizarre statements after the fact, like his labor secretary, Laurie Chavez, former congresswoman, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=24.24s)]
*  she says, what the goal of all of this is, is to try to bring the kind of manufacturing jobs that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=31.84s)]
*  exist in Vietnam and Cambodia. And she says that Americans are going to be working those jobs very [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=37.68s)]
*  soon. Here, play this clip. Just to take one example, I was hearing about, you know, companies [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=43.44s)]
*  that make shirts and garments and Vietnam and Cambodia, that it's very difficult. There are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=48.48s)]
*  certain things that we can ramp up fairly quickly. As I said a moment ago about, you know, car [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  manufacturers and lines that they can kind of kick open fairly quickly. But will American workers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=59.2s)]
*  make shirts and garments for the same, you know, obviously the labor cost is so much cheaper [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=66.24s)]
*  overseas in those places. So how's that going to work, secretary? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=73.44s)]
*  Well, I think that that's exactly what the president talked about in the Rose Garden when [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=76.72s)]
*  he was talking to the American worker and to the people and saying, we're going to onshore repatriate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=80.0s)]
*  some of these companies to invest in America directly so that we can build that workforce. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=86.08s)]
*  We can retrain, we can upskill, and we can have the American worker be paying attention to what's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=91.6s)]
*  happening on the ground. They want to make America like Cambodia and Vietnam. That's part of the plan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=98.16s)]
*  Also, you see the stock ticker there showing 38,000 just a few weeks ago was 44,000, 45,000, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=103.36s)]
*  heading to 50,000. Here's, by the way, Senator Sheehy of Montana talking about, again, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  it's going to be a lot of pain, but it's going to teach us all to be self-sufficient and Americans [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=118.16s)]
*  need to learn how to become self-sufficient. We're too reliant on world economies. Here, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=123.92s)]
*  play this clip. How is that going to impact our access to those things, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=128.88s)]
*  Senator? It's certainly going to have a negative impact shortly, but the reality is, Martha, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=133.04s)]
*  this is because generations of us incentivizing companies to invest elsewhere. That's exactly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=137.28s)]
*  what the president is trying to do is bring critical industries back to America. Because [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=143.44s)]
*  when we have our next national emergency, whether it's a world war or whether it's another pandemic, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=147.2s)]
*  we have to be able to be safe. We need to become more self-sufficient, he said at the end of the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  clip. Let's bring in Democratic Congress member Jared Moskowitz from Florida. Congressman, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=156.72s)]
*  more self-sufficient, more like Vietnam and Cambodia. All I'm seeing are the markets crashing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=161.36s)]
*  every single day, and especially from where you're at, and that's affecting all Americans, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=167.28s)]
*  but in your congressional district as well, people in their retirement, living off their life savings [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=172.56s)]
*  and 401Ks. I mean, what Trump and MAG is doing, it's disastrous. Yeah. Well, first, Ben, since I'm [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=178.0s)]
*  three hours ahead of you, from the future, it's not good over here, 2200 points and still going. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=185.28s)]
*  We're getting close to the closing bell. It's not funny, actually, what's happening. What happened [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=193.2s)]
*  yesterday, what happened today? And look, let me say a couple of things. I think we've got to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  separate this debate. Okay. So yes, during COVID, when I was the director of emergency management [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=204.0s)]
*  in Florida, I had to buy products from all over the world. It was frustrating, medicine, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=209.68s)]
*  things of that nature. Okay. We did have supply chain issues. And then when Trump did the first [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=213.76s)]
*  stimulus package, three, $4 trillion, he didn't do anything to fix any of the supply chain issues, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=219.44s)]
*  which we could have done. Then fast forward, we passed the chips and science act, which was to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  fix the chip supply chain issue. Most Republicans voted against that. Trump wants to repeal it, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=230.56s)]
*  he said, in his State of the Union. And we all know that this team sport thing, like it's just [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=235.68s)]
*  ignoring the facts. I mean, I give credit to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They've been very tough. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Tariffs are attacks. This is going to be a tax on the American people when they say pain in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=248.88s)]
*  short term, like it's going to be a 30 day deal. Okay. Factories can't come online immediately. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=253.44s)]
*  I do think we should make things more things here. Can't make everything here because obviously [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=259.12s)]
*  the reason we make goods in other countries is so that the cost of those goods to Americans are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=264.48s)]
*  cheaper. You think if we made everything in America where wages are $15 an hour, which is a good thing, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=269.6s)]
*  where people get healthcare, which is a good thing. You think you can find things at Walmart [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=275.12s)]
*  for 99 cents. It's not going to happen. The idea of that was to get goods cheaper in this country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=278.24s)]
*  That doesn't mean we can't have more manufacturing here. We should have more manufacturing here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=283.36s)]
*  And so let me separate the goal from the execution. The goal of increasing manufacturing, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=287.76s)]
*  it's a bipartisan goal. We all support that. Democrats were the ones who did that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=293.12s)]
*  with the chips and science act that Republicans voted against. That was to increase chip [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=296.64s)]
*  manufacturing here in America. Okay. But this execution of what they're doing, okay, is that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=300.08s)]
*  shit crazy. Okay. We're going to crash the stock market. And then Trump comes out in tweets and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=307.36s)]
*  says, oh, maybe Powell should lower the interest rates. What are you doing? Are you crashing the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=312.32s)]
*  stock market so that you can get interest rates lower? Powell came out today and said, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=317.2s)]
*  that that's not going to happen. And you all know, we all know that if Joe Biden did this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  or made any policy change in which we lost 34,000 points, okay. And in almost 4,000 points in a two [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  day period, we've gone from 44,000 to 38,000 since Trump took office. They'd be like, it's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  because Joe Biden's in the basement. It's because he's with Hunter. There wouldn't be enough air [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  time in the day for them to fill, but yet most Republicans are silent. Trump's a genius, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=346.72s)]
*  They say, I don't remember Trump ever talking about crashing the stock market while he was on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  stage in between the Hannibal Lecter talk. I don't remember. I mean, are you not entertained? I mean, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=359.92s)]
*  by the way, this is not easy to do. I mean, give Trump credit. I mean, he literally killed [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=366.16s)]
*  the economy, which he told everyone was terrible. Okay. And some people believe that, but the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=374.88s)]
*  economy wasn't terrible. Well, it is now. So he's made that happen. I mean, he literally wiped away [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=380.88s)]
*  trillions of dollars from the US economy. We can't even make that up in the tariffs. And so look, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=388.08s)]
*  he tariffed the penguins. He tariffed Vietnam, Madagascar. Okay. I mean, I don't know what the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=395.92s)]
*  plan is. Is the plan to get people who live in Vietnam to move to Greenland and make the shirts [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=401.84s)]
*  there? Nobody really knows what's going on. And Ben, let's not forget. Let's not forget. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=406.32s)]
*  Can you imagine if Joe Biden was playing golf for two days while the stock market was cratering? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the articles of impeachment that they would be filing, 50 members, okay, they would [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  have tried to impeach his dog. Okay. You know, based on what was going on, but this is the time [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=426.96s)]
*  we live in everything Trump does is good. Even when we're staring in the face, it reminds me that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=433.76s)]
*  leader to a Capri movie. Don't look up. That's, that's where the Republican party is right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=439.2s)]
*  Don't look up. And I know there are people out there who are like, this is good. The Republicans [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  are going to get wiped out in the midterm and don't get me wrong. I want to win the midterm. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=447.44s)]
*  And we need breaks on president Trump. That's why him getting the house in the Senate was so bad. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  But a lot of people are going to get hurt. Businesses, people, seniors, my community, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=456.24s)]
*  that this is their nest egg. They don't have 10 years to recover. You know, this is, this is, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=461.92s)]
*  this is all very bad. You know, when you talk about Trump golfing while the economy crashes, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  it's almost like, as you know, it's like this old family guy things where you keep seeing more and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=473.92s)]
*  it just kind of gets worse and worse. And then like, it never stops getting worse for like, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=479.92s)]
*  You mean when Peter like runs, he goes to the Hindenpeter and he gets in and then it just [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=483.76s)]
*  crashes. And it's like eight minutes though, and they drag it out until a commercial break. So [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=488.16s)]
*  yes, he's playing golf while the market's crashing with the Saudi leaders who are paying him at his [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=494.16s)]
*  resort for a live golf tournament where he's making personal money, promoting his brand [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=502.8s)]
*  while they do pink Birkin bag Hermes parties at Mar-a-Lago celebrating $450,000 handbags while [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  flying Marine One into the golf course or onto the golf course to show off. But here, congressman is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=518.56s)]
*  what Trump is saying. And with statements like this, it makes things worse infinitely. The post [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=525.28s)]
*  was week 11 wins. This was posted on Friday after the markets crash, week 11 wins. President [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=532.64s)]
*  Trump unleashes economic prosperity. It was another highly successful week for the American [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=539.12s)]
*  people. As President Donald J. Trump continues his relentless pursuit of strength, prosperity and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=545.2s)]
*  peace and lays the foundation for America to be the global powerhouse for generations to come. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=551.44s)]
*  They're celebrating this as the greatest week of prosperity. And you see that I mean, what's your [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=557.84s)]
*  response to that? Look, they're used to spinning things, right and creating their own sort of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=562.48s)]
*  reality. They're used to doing that. But this is going to be different. People are going people are [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=568.88s)]
*  being affected, right? Like so it's not just like a talking point. They can see what's happening in [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=574.08s)]
*  the market. And so yeah, look, there are people who voted for Donald Trump that thought, you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=579.04s)]
*  he was a stable genius and he's going to, you know, get us to the promised land golden age. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=584.4s)]
*  And, you know, now's not a time to revel in the fact that, you know, this is what they voted for. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=588.96s)]
*  But, you know, these people are probably now and I'm hearing from some of them business owners [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=594.64s)]
*  who are having orders canceled, people are pulling back, pulling back their money from the economy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=599.68s)]
*  You know, this, I mean, you got JP Morgan saying, you know, this is the highest tax increase on the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  American people. You know, you have JP Morgan saying that there's now a 60% chance of recession. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E343cgWMbkI&t=611.28s)]
