# Fox News PANICS on LIVE TV as Trump LOSES IT ALL
**MeidasTouch:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA)
*  State regime media known as Fox is having a total meltdown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=0.0s)]
*  They have to try to cover up for Donald Trump's deranged behavior when Donald Trump is making [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=4.8s)]
*  posts that former President Biden was secretly executed in 2020 and a robot has now replaced [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=10.88s)]
*  former President Biden. What Fox has to do for its audience is say, oh, well, I know [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=18.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's humor and of course he's joking there, but he raises a very serious point [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  about the auto pen and what was actually happening with former President Biden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  I want you to watch how state regime media gets into work for the most deranged kind of coverup [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=36.56s)]
*  of Donald Trump's insanity. Watch this. Apparently, Donald Trump reposted somebody's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  post on True Social claiming that Biden had been executed in 2020 and was replaced by a robotic [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=51.28s)]
*  clone. Clearly, President Trump did not believe that, but he put it out there. And here's what [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=57.6s)]
*  the New York Times wrote. Trump amplifies another outlandish conspiracy theory. Biden is a robotic [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=62.72s)]
*  clone. President Trump reposted another user's false claim that the former president had been [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=67.84s)]
*  executed in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. I know Trump's sense of humor. I'm sure he was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=72.08s)]
*  just trolling him. What do you think? Well, I would hope so. But I think also it gets to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=78.56s)]
*  the real heart of the scandal, which is who in the world was president for the past four years? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  If it wasn't Joe Biden, was it a clone? Was it a cable of White House officials? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=86.88s)]
*  So then the next thing they have to do on state regime media is inject a culture war issue. So [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=90.88s)]
*  they spend a great deal of their coverage attacking none other than Miss Rachel. And as somebody who [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=98.16s)]
*  has an eight month old girl, my eight month old girl, absolutely baby loves Miss Rachel. And so [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=107.04s)]
*  here on Fox, they're saying, how dare Miss Rachel make any statements about Gaza? She needs to just [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=113.76s)]
*  shut up and sing songs to kids. She has no right to speak out against babies and kids getting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=121.84s)]
*  indiscriminately killed in Gaza. How dare she? That's where Fox is going with this, which to me [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=129.28s)]
*  is absolutely despicable. Here play this clip. Laura, why is everybody suddenly an activist? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=135.04s)]
*  Now she's kitty care at the foreign relations committee. No one wants to hear that from Miss [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=141.28s)]
*  Rachel. Mr. Rogers in our day, he didn't start lecturing kids about Russia or Iran or the nuclear [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=146.32s)]
*  threat. That's not your job. And I worry everybody feels they have to get on the activist bandwagon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=153.44s)]
*  Now, Miss Rachel, you don't know anything about the Middle East, the Middle East, the Middle East. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=160.08s)]
*  Maybe we have to just kind of, you know, speaking vernacular. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Miss Rachel has said, as a human being, I can't sit by as I see babies and children and innocent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=173.68s)]
*  people dying in mass amounts of people in Gaza. That's what she says. And she goes, why would I [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=181.68s)]
*  be attacked? I'm not going to be silenced for that. But this is all part of the Fox agenda to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=188.56s)]
*  attack and silence influential people and mock them who don't conform to the state regime media's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=194.16s)]
*  lines. So then you have Jesse Waters and it just gets weirder and more deranged. Jesse Waters talks [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=202.4s)]
*  about the Republican Senate leader Thune. I've seen him at the gym. He's a very muscular man, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=209.6s)]
*  very strong, very masculine. Unlike Chuck Schumer, who's a girl, who's a woman. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=217.92s)]
*  Watch what Jesse Waters says here. Play this clip. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=225.44s)]
*  So I was at a resort a little while back and I saw Senator Thune at the gym. The man is jacked. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=228.64s)]
*  And the guy is in great shape and he lifts hard. You look at Schumer, he's built like a woman. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=235.92s)]
*  Now men do not want to be led by the party of women. Men want to be led by other men. So Democrats [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=242.32s)]
*  need to become men and then they can persuade men. But they have to lift first. I'm serious. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  There's a quote by Maya Angelou. Thank you. Could you ask permission from Dana before you keep going? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=256.48s)]
*  People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did, but people will never forget [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=263.04s)]
*  how you made them feel. People don't like the way they feel around Democrats. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=267.68s)]
*  Because Democrats don't like the way they feel. And if they lifted, they feel better. And then [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=273.76s)]
*  everybody around them would feel better. You had me in mind. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=278.56s)]
*  Hear what he said? Men don't want to be led by the party of women. Again, how misogynistic [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=281.04s)]
*  can you get also? First off, nothing wrong to be led by women. I think we'd probably be better off [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=288.16s)]
*  as a nation if we were being led by women than Mr. Emotional himself, Donald Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=293.36s)]
*  Where are you going? I'm playing the victim. I'm playing the victim. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=298.72s)]
*  So I think that we would be in a much better position if we had women running the country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  and running trade policy and running a lot of things, is my view about it. But that's what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=306.0s)]
*  Jesse Waters is spending his time talking about. So then they bring on another guest who literally [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=311.04s)]
*  uses his time on Fox to pitch an AI powered threat detection system for law enforcement to scan [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=317.92s)]
*  how radicalized people are. And it ranks people based on how radicalized they are. And he goes, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald, if you're watching, you want to buy my AI. Here, play this clip. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  To what Ari said, the problem here is growing exponentially. Let me say this. I have just built, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=338.56s)]
*  Sean, the first AI powered threat detection system for law enforcement that scans the open web [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=345.2s)]
*  for radicalization and tactical planning. And if somebody in the Trump administration is listening, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=352.48s)]
*  partner with me and let's scale this and get local law enforcement the tools they need. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=358.24s)]
*  My technology will prevent these threats from popping off. You have to get in front of these, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=364.08s)]
*  the technologies here, the Israeli model meets Palantir quality engineering, and I've got it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=370.0s)]
*  And the White House needs to give me a buzz and let's get this thing scaled nationally. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=377.04s)]
*  And it's called Gideon. As Michael McKean says, I guess he tried [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=381.68s)]
*  Shark Tank already, I assume. But in all seriousness, we know that Donald Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  has entered into a big contract with a company called Palantir, an AI company who's a big lead [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=392.72s)]
*  investor was Peter Thiel and the tech bros behind it. And they are compiling a database [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=399.52s)]
*  using AI of all of our personal information. So the Trump regime is gathering a list and data [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  that has all of our personal data in it. And they're hiring this company Palantir to help [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=414.24s)]
*  get them this, that as I've always said, too, I always thought one of the things that Doge was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  focused on was getting our data for Elon Musk's AI and nothing to do with actually reducing the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=425.12s)]
*  budget or reducing government spending in any way. I mean, federal spending is higher right now [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=432.8s)]
*  than it was ever before. I want to share this with you as well. This was from the Fox Morning Show [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=439.52s)]
*  where they were saying, you know, stop with this conspiracy theory that Donald Trump and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=447.44s)]
*  Barron didn't get into Harvard. Donald Trump's a true patriot by going after Harvard. This is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=454.72s)]
*  about patriotism. Here, play this clip. Stop with this conspiracy theory. The president's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=460.64s)]
*  not going after Harvard because Barron didn't get accepted, didn't even apply, turns out. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=465.6s)]
*  The president's going after Harvard because it's about patriotism. And if you're not going to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=470.56s)]
*  follow the law here in America and you're going to go out and vandalize and break into classrooms [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=475.28s)]
*  because you hate America, why are you here? President Trump is saying, think about the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=480.55999999999995s)]
*  makeup of our country. Most people can't get accepted to Harvard, right? I mean, most people [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  are not that bright to be able to do that. So it's the best of the best. So, and that's great. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=490.88s)]
*  That's fine. Some of these institutions are helping with cancer research and getting the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=495.84s)]
*  bottom of AI and technology and enhancing all of our lives. However, the majority of people can't [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=499.36s)]
*  relate to the Harvard life. And so the most of the people who watch our show, who are watching the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=506.48s)]
*  news, they can't relate to this. And they're saying, go Donald Trump, because you're protecting [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=511.2s)]
*  America. We don't want terrorists here. We don't want people that are waving Hamas flags on Harvard's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=516.08s)]
*  campus. My teeth are very important to me. Healthy mouth, healthy life, right? Well, if you're part [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=520.88s)]
*  of the 30% of Americans who grind their teeth, then your smile needs protection. And there's no [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=526.0s)]
*  better solution than Remy's custom fit night guard. Both dentists and teeth grinders recommend Remy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=531.6s)]
*  because the custom fit night guard is the best way to protect your teeth. And Remy is 80% less [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=537.28s)]
*  than the dentist and way easier. Here's how it works. You receive your impression kit straight [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=543.36s)]
*  to your door. Remy gives you step-by-step instructions to get your perfect impression. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=548.96s)]
*  Remy ships you your custom fit night guard made in the US and Las Vegas. Get your night guard back [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=554.16s)]

*  really invested in making sure that you get the best product possible. The best part is Remy is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=565.92s)]
*  so confident you'll get a perfect fit that they offer a 45 night perfect fit guarantee or your [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=570.88s)]

*  And again, notice how they try to divide our country. Most people who watch our show [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  can't relate to the Harvard way of life. And again, it's just trying to divide the American [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=609.68s)]
*  people over and over again. I do want to turn to a second though to show you what they were playing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=615.28s)]
*  on CNN last night. Because even I'm just letting you know, I'm showing you state regime media with [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  Fox. But then when I turned on to see what was going on with CNN, when they were talking about [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=626.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's posts about former President Biden being executed and is actually a robot, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=632.56s)]
*  the way they frame this on CNN is that this is actually both sides. Both sides are to blame. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=639.36s)]
*  Both sides have conspiracy theories. It's like when Democrats say that there's a body double for [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=645.84s)]
*  Melania. It's just everybody left, right, both sides. They all make this up. This was from CNN [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=652.08s)]
*  and you had governor Sununu talking about this here, play this clip. I mean, he used it to, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=658.64s)]
*  I don't know. I can't say whether he believed it or not. Do you think the Democrats are conspiracy [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  theorists? Nothing on Hunter Biden's laptop. Russia influenced the election. I mean, come on, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=669.6s)]
*  both sides are definitely to blame. And when it comes to a robot, this would have been the worst [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  functioning robot in history if Joe Biden was a robot. I mean, it must have been made and built [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=680.16s)]
*  in China at a minimum. Your argument is definitely fair in the sense that Democrats do believe in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=685.76s)]
*  conspiracies. Although I'm not sure the two examples are the best ones. The best one might be [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=691.36s)]
*  the fake Melania conspiracy, which Trump actually denounced in a post on social media. He says that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=695.12s)]
*  the conspiracy was that there were Photoshopped pictures of Melania claiming that it wasn't really [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=703.44s)]
*  her at his side. So that is also similar to the robot, I suppose. The body double is the other one. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=708.96s)]
*  And by the way, even Abby Phillip, who I like was like, your argument is definitely fair in the sense [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=716.4s)]
*  that Democrats do believe in conspiracies. We're talking about the president of the United States [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=722.96s)]
*  reposting that former president Biden got executed and is a robot now. I don't remember former [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=729.84s)]
*  president Biden making posts like that or former president Obama. If you want to find some random [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=737.52s)]
*  people out there who consider themselves left, who have said conspiracies, that's your equivalent [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=744.0s)]
*  to what Donald Trump's been saying. I mean, it's absolutely, absolutely despicable right there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=753.92s)]
*  And it's always projection with these people and always convention. Here's James Comer saying, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=760.08s)]
*  really, when it comes to the Democrats, there's no vision. They just want to obstruct. They just [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=766.08s)]
*  want to create fear in the voters, which quite literally is what the MAGA Republicans are doing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=772.0s)]
*  Let's play this clip. That's all they've done. They don't have an ideology. Our good friend, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=777.04s)]
*  Stephen Miller said it well in an interview a couple of days ago. There is no ideology. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  There is no vision by the Democrat party. They just want to obstruct. They want to create fear [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=788.16s)]
*  in the voters that the Republicans are somehow a threat to democracy. When all the evidence shows [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=795.68s)]
*  that everything they've done over the last four and a half years has been a threat to democracy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=801.36s)]
*  And one more thing, Maria, I said next week, this is Sunday. So we're talking about in a couple of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=805.28s)]
*  days, in a matter of days, hours, we should be able to hopefully announce something about these [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=810.16s)]
*  five individuals coming in. Well, we're going to keep on it. And I'm going to come back to you in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=816.4s)]
*  a couple of days. If I don't see it, we're counting on you. We're counting on Ed Martin. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=820.72s)]
*  And we're counting on Pam Bondi. Thank you, gentlemen. Which is why it is such an honor [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=824.4s)]
*  that at the Midas Touch Network, we have people like Katie Fang after she leaves cable news, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  work for us here at the Midas Touch Network. So here is Katie Fang. And you could contrast [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=835.36s)]
*  what those other shows were doing with what Katie Fang was doing on our show last night. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=841.5200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. Here's the other part of the truth social post he said, which was ridiculous. He said, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=846.0s)]
*  quote, radical left judges together with some very bad people are destroying America. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=850.32s)]
*  Get the F out of here. These radical left judges, these are judges that you had a hand in appointing [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=854.8s)]
*  Donald Trump or they were appointed under Republican administrations. So how very convenient that when [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  you don't get your way, suddenly, there's all radical left judges. It's just intellectually [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=866.4s)]
*  lazy. He is just an intellectually lazy asshole. And the fact that this is what he does. Yeah, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=871.76s)]
*  listen, it's noteworthy. I mean, we're talking about it, right? But it's because in this case, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  right? But it's because it involves such an incredibly powerful and influential organization. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=883.36s)]
*  But I would like to say this. I would like to say the following. I think it also goes to show, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=889.52s)]
*  though, in many ways, that the influence and the power of the federal society is going to be waiting [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=894.32s)]
*  now. Because if the message is being sent that a president doesn't need you anymore, yeah, are they [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=899.84s)]
*  going to dig in? Sure, they will. But I think it also shows that it's a sign of the times. It's a [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=905.2s)]
*  sign of the times that the president is saying, I don't need you to be able to help me with [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=911.92s)]
*  judicial appointments. Now, is it a bad sign when he's just rewarding loyalists like Emil Boves? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  Sure. But I do think that we should look at it and consider the fact that this is a message that's [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=923.36s)]
*  being sent to the federal society. Yo, peace out. There is a big divide now between the Oval Office [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=928.88s)]
*  and you guys, and we don't need you. But then on the same token, along the same token, right? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  Federal society is telling Donald Trump, we don't need you either. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  So do you prefer that or how about Kristi Noem right here saying, this is what Donald Trump [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  campaigned for, sending migrants without criminal records to concentration camps? Play this clip. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=950.5600000000001s)]
*  Because, you know, you've got globalists out there who are saying, oh, you know, they're going to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=956.4s)]
*  arrest people who have jobs and that's going to impact the jobs market. And then we're not going [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=960.72s)]
*  to have the people to do the jobs we need. What do you want to say to those people who are critical [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=966.24s)]
*  of the president's agenda when it comes to immigration? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=973.36s)]
*  The president is doing exactly what he campaigned on and what the American people elected him to do, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=979.04s)]
*  and that's enforce the law. And so we are going to do mass deportations. We are focusing on dangerous [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=983.52s)]
*  criminals. We are going out there and ensuring the people that repeatedly break our laws are [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=989.44s)]
*  being held accountable. Tell me what you think. I'm Ben Myselos from the Midas Touch Network. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4je4oF1sA&t=993.76s)]
