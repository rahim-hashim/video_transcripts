# MAJOR Leaks CRIPPLE Trump as PARANOIA SPREADS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ)
*  Paranoia is engulfing the White House right now. Donald Trump can't stop the leaks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Pete Hegseth can't stop the leaks like the leaks that took place on Easter Sunday, where we learn [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=4.96s)]
*  that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who has no business being the Secretary of Defense because [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=10.32s)]
*  he has no leadership experience, and he was a Fox News host before becoming the Secretary of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Defense in any event, that he was involved in more classified communications using the Signal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=19.84s)]
*  Text Message app, similar to what we learned about several weeks ago. There's a whole other [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=25.04s)]
*  text message thread, this time involving Pete Hegseth and his wife, his brother, and his lawyer, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=29.76s)]
*  where they were also talking about F.A. 18 strikes against the Houthis, similar to that other text [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  message thread, where they included the Editor-in-Chief from The Atlantic. Yep, there were four separate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=41.84s)]
*  sources. Lots of people want to leak information on you there, Pete Hegseth, who told the New York [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=47.6s)]
*  Times what went down, a blockbuster story on Easter. Here's what the New York Times reported. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=52.56s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information about forthcoming strikes in Yemen [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  on March 15th in a private Signal group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=63.28s)]
*  according to four people with knowledge of the chat. Some of those people said that the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=68.48s)]
*  information Mr. Hegseth shared on Signal chat included the fights, the flight schedules for the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=72.56s)]
*  F.A. 18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen, essentially the same attack plans that he shared [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=77.52s)]
*  on a separate Signal chat the same day that mistakenly included the Editor of The Atlantic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=82.8s)]
*  Uh-oh, Pete Hegseth, that doesn't sound too good. But also, Pete Hegseth has been firing all of his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=88.24s)]
*  core staff recently. His Chief of Staff, Senior Advisor, Deputy Chief of Staff, the Deputy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=94.32s)]
*  Secretary's Chief of Staff, they were all fired on Friday. Why? Because Hegseth is paranoid. He [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=100.24s)]
*  thinks everybody's leaking. But you fired those people and the leaks keep on happening. Hegseth, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=106.4s)]
*  what in the world is going on here? Tom Cotton, MAGA Republican Senator, wrote the following on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=112.64s)]
*  Sunday. It seems like the leak investigation at the Pentagon needs to continue to find these [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=118.48s)]
*  latest leakers. Secretary Hegseth is busy implementing Trump's America First agenda [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  while these leakers are trying to undermine them both. Shameful. This is what the MAGA Republicans [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=130.96s)]
*  are focusing on. That's what's actually shameful that they're worried about the leakers versus [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=137.52s)]
*  our classified information being sent out to the Secretary of Defense wife, brother, and personal [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  lawyer. As our Editor-in-Chief Ron Filipkowski correctly points out, what is shameful is that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=148.24s)]
*  your take is to hunt down more Trump appointees and hires who dare to tell the truth about the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=154.88s)]
*  debacle happening at the Pentagon because of Hegseth rather than taking a principal stand against [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=162.0s)]
*  that shitshow. But sadly, that would require courage and you don't have courage. As CNN reported, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=169.04s)]
*  following a series of leaks about military planning for the Panama Canal and the Middle East and Musk's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=176.56s)]
*  visit to the Pentagon, Hegseth is beginning to lash out and he grew suspicious that senior military [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=182.4s)]
*  officials as well as some of his closest advisors were leaking information to undermine him. These [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  are his people. These are Trump people. These are their appointees. Let's be clear, although they'll [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=193.68s)]
*  probably say these are radical leftist deep staters. That goes on to say at one point, Hegseth even [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=199.68s)]
*  demanded the FBI probe into the leaks, which some of his aides advised against. Sources said, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=206.0s)]
*  so more leakers. There was already an active inspector general investigation focusing on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=212.16s)]
*  Hegseth and bringing the FBI might only invite more scrutiny. Those aides advised should also be noted [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=218.16s)]
*  that his own spokesperson who quit last week, John Elliott, John Elliott just wrote an op-ed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=226.24s)]
*  for Politico and here's what it's called. Former top Pentagon spokesperson details the month from [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=234.08s)]
*  hell inside the agency. The total chaos at the Department of Defense is becoming a major [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=240.88s)]
*  distraction rights. John Elliott and Elliott again, who was Hegseth spokesperson says he expects there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=247.28s)]
*  to be major, major bombshells that are going to be dropping this week in addition to what we are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=253.92s)]
*  reporting right here. One of the things I want to point out about Hegseth is that this was always [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=260.88s)]
*  his MO right here, which is to blame leakers and say it's everybody's fault. Even during the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=267.12s)]
*  confirmation hearing of Pete Hegseth, when there was all of this information that accused him of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  sexual assault, that accused him of being drunk on the job, that accused him of going to strip clubs [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=279.6s)]
*  and doing all of these just, you know, unprofessional things. Remember what he said? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=287.36s)]
*  Leakers, leakers, leakers here play this clip. Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=292.4s)]
*  to meet the overwhelming demands of this job. We must acknowledge the concerning public reports [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  against you. A variety of sources, including your own writings, implicate you with disregarding the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment and other troubling issues. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=318.24s)]
*  I have reviewed many of these allegations and find them extremely alarming. Indeed, the totality of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  your own writings and alleged conduct would disqualify any service member from holding any [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  leadership position in the military, much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So that was always his MO. And by the way, if you go back to what Hegseth had previously said [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=341.12s)]
*  when he was a Fox host about others, when he was saying, you know, if you were leaking, you should [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=346.48s)]
*  be held to the highest standards, you know, when he would spread conspiracies about people. But [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  here's what he would say about like leaking when he would talk about like Hillary Clinton and others [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=356.8s)]
*  here play this clip. Well, she's got two problems here. Two words, top secret. Before it was servers, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=360.56s)]
*  it was classified. It was sort of this amorphous idea that maybe it was wrong. Everyone knows what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  top secret means. I've had a top secret clearance. It's big red flashing letters, top secret. You know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=372.8s)]
*  when you're looking at something that's top secret or dealing with it. In this case, the public will [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=378.16s)]
*  resonate with that. Hey, if you're hiding that on a private server, that's a very real problem. And [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=381.92s)]
*  likely criminal charges to follow if they're being fair about it. So it's obvious we all know what [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  was going on here. Democratic Congress member Jamie Raskin was on the Midas Touch Network [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=390.8s)]
*  on Sunday. He was with our own Anthony Davis on the weekend show. And here's what Jamie Raskin [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=396.64s)]
*  had to say. Let's play this clip. And Speaker Johnson's chief of staff got into his car [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=402.08s)]
*  and drove at 38 miles per hour and plowed in the back of a police vehicle and staggered out. And [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=409.28s)]
*  the police found him and he was determined to have been drunk. And that was when I realized that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=415.76s)]
*  they've replaced DEI hires with DUI hires. And you see the help of Secretary Hague Saffin, a lot of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=421.28s)]
*  other people who can who can actually be promoted to the highest levels of this government with the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=428.64s)]
*  most irresponsible personal behavior. But they all happen to be white guys. So they pass the test of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=434.32s)]
*  not being DEI. Here's the thing. The Democratic senators during the confirmation hearings were [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=439.76s)]
*  calling this behavior out about Hegseth in advance. Like here was Mark Kelly in 47 seconds, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=446.96s)]
*  just completely demolishes Hegseth and makes it clear that Hegseth should be nowhere near [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  any leadership position at all. And the Secretary of Defense play this clip. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=459.84s)]
*  This episode of the Midas Touch Podcast is brought to you by the American People. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=483.52s)]
*  This is brought to you by Graza. And yes, it's my new favorite olive oil. It's fresh, never blended, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=513.52s)]
*  and comes from a single type of olive, the Pacual, straight out of high in Spain, where over half the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=518.96s)]
*  world's olive oil is made. So what makes Graza so good? First, it's single origin, which means [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=524.0s)]
*  no mystery blends, just pure flavorful oil you could actually trust. And the packaging, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  game changer. Squeeze and spray bottles, no drippy mess, no fussy tins, just aim, squeeze, done. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=534.72s)]
*  They've got three types. Frizzle, the newest one for high heat frying and grilling. Sizzle, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=541.2s)]
*  your go-to everyday oil for sauteing or roasting. And drizzle, a bold finishing oil you'll want to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=545.44s)]
*  put on everything. Yes, even ice cream. Don't knock it till you try it. Personally, I love using Graza. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=550.72s)]
*  It's perfect for when I'm roasting veggies, super clean, super flavorful, and way easier than my old [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=556.96s)]
*  olive oil setup. I've also been making some amazing salad dressings with the drizzle oil. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  It's so good, so convenient. I don't think I could ever go back to anything else. So head to Graza, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=566.48s)]
*  and use code MIDAS to get 10% off of Trio, which includes sizzle, frizzle, and drizzle, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=571.68s)]
*  and get to cook in your next chef quality meal. That's Graza.co and use MIDAS, M-E-I-D-A-S. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=577.12s)]
*  And here's Democratic Senator Gary Peters during Hegseth's confirmation hearing, where, again, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=584.4s)]
*  Hegseth was talking about how he wants to go after DEI, and that's going to be his main priority. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=591.68s)]
*  And Senator Peters said, you know, it's interesting that you talk about going [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=598.56s)]
*  after DEI. You seem to be the least qualified individual to ever come close to the Pentagon, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=601.92s)]
*  yet alone to be the leader of it. Here, play this clip. We've written publicly that DEI policy is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  distraction and have military personnel walking on edge shells. Do you believe that emails like that, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=613.76s)]
*  that are essentially threatening both a serving officer and a spouse and claiming that they'll [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=620.2399999999999s)]
*  lose their pension will have a distraction and detract from the lethality? Senator, you mentioned [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=627.12s)]
*  the 40s and 50s, and you're precisely right. The military was a forerunner in courageous racial [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=634.8s)]
*  integration in ways no other institutions were willing to do. I served with men and women of all [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=641.04s)]
*  backgrounds because of the courage of people. Do you believe it's incredibly important? However, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=645.52s)]
*  the DEI policies of today are not the same as what happened back then. They're dividing troops [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=651.84s)]
*  inside formations, causing commanders to walk on eggshells, not putting meritocracy first. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=658.24s)]
*  That's the indictment that's made by those serving right now and why we're having this conversation. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=665.12s)]
*  All of your public comments don't talk about meritocracy. They talk about liberal, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=670.72s)]
*  democratic efforts that are destroying the military, that those people are our enemies. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=676.32s)]
*  That's not meritocracy. That's a political view. And your goal, as I see emerging, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=682.72s)]
*  is to politicize the military in favor of your particular positions, which you've outlined [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=690.32s)]
*  extensively, which would be the worst blow to the professionalism of the United States military. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=696.64s)]
*  Now, previously, when Donald Trump was asked about Signalgate, remember, Donald Trump just said, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=703.04s)]
*  I don't want to talk about it. We're done. Don't ask me questions like that ever again. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=708.24s)]
*  This is what Trump said a few weeks back when reporters were trying to follow up on that story. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=712.4s)]
*  This is the behavior of people who are unprofessional, who just shut down rather [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=717.76s)]
*  than address actual controversies and serious problems. Avoidance. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=723.68s)]
*  What can happen on Pete Hegseth in this IG investigation? Do you want to weigh in on that? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=730.24s)]
*  What is it? There's an IG investigation into the Secretary of Defense's use of the Signal app. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=734.96s)]
*  Oh, is thatâ€”you're bringing that up again? Don't bring that up again. You're editors, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=742.4s)]
*  probably. That's such a wasted story. So what else? Chinese farmland. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=745.92s)]
*  Now, as we previously reported, the Pentagon's acting inspector general is already involved in [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=750.88s)]
*  an investigation into Pete Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app to disclose the timing and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=757.6s)]
*  other details of the U.S. fighter jets' airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen. The mission of the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=763.52s)]
*  probe is to determine the extent of these types of communications. So I think one of the things [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=770.08s)]
*  we could probably expect this weekâ€”I don't think this is that bold of a prediction. They're going [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=776.16s)]
*  to try to go after that inspector general, right? They're going toâ€”I bet you they're going to try [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=782.4s)]
*  to accuse the inspector general and all the people that he fired, and they'll probably accuse the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=786.32s)]
*  former spokesperson of being the sources or facilitating this information to the New York [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=791.84s)]
*  Times, and they'll probably accuse all those people of that. Again, when I think about how [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  unqualified Hegseth is, I think about Hegseth's appearance in front of NATO also back in February, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  and here's what he said. Remember he said this play. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=812.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, like President Eisenhower, this administration believes in alliances, deeply believes in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=814.88s)]
*  alliances. But make no mistake, President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=821.92s)]
*  into Uncle Sucker. Thank you, and we're glad to take some questions. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=830.56s)]
*  Remember he said President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=835.76s)]
*  Remember we kept him drinking the glass, too, and it just looked really bizarre as well. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=841.76s)]
*  I had the opportunity to interview recently Democratic Congressmember Jim Himes, the ranking [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=847.04s)]
*  member of the Intelligence Committee, and I asked him about Pete Hegseth's statements or Pete Hegseth's [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=853.68s)]
*  post in the first Signal Chat, and here's whatâ€”again, ranking member of the Intelligence [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=861.92s)]
*  Committee, Democratic Congressmember Jim Himes. Here's what he had to say. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=868.32s)]
*  The oversight task is enormous, and then let me say this, too. I know what was happening here. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=872.72s)]
*  You just have to read Pete Hegseth's typed-in text about F-18s launching accompanied by MQ-9s. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=878.48s)]
*  Weather good. Sent com says go. This is Pete Hegseth playing soldier, right? It's just the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=885.36s)]
*  testosterone upwelling he gets when he gets to type MQ-9s en route is his life right now. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  He's a guy who is not even closely qualified to the position he has, and so when he gets to get [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=897.84s)]
*  on a Signal Chat with his buddies and say, where it goes? Sent com says all in F-18s, it just makes [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  him feel really, really good. Sadly, of course, it puts our people at risk. And so, folks, we'll keep [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=909.04s)]
*  you posted as we learn more here, but clearly this is going to become a developing story, and one of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=914.08s)]
*  the things I think we're going to see more of are these types of leaks. You're going to see the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=921.36s)]
*  attacks on the leaks versus the attacks on the conduct, but this is what happens in authoritarian [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=927.44s)]
*  regimes that go after its people, and one of the things that we've always said that these authoritarian [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=934.4s)]
*  regimes do first is they attack their own people first, oftentimes, and so now their own people are [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=940.24s)]
*  in self-preservation mode. They're leaking information, so I look forward to what John [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=946.8s)]
*  Elliott's talking about. More bombshells this week. I'm sure there's probably going to be [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  much more communications that we're going to learn about. Probably more people are going to be fired. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=955.68s)]
*  John Elliott says it's utter madness, total chaos in the Department of Defense right now, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=961.68s)]
*  and again, these are Trump people who are out there saying it, so we'll keep you posted every [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAA44GyTpqQ&t=967.28s)]
