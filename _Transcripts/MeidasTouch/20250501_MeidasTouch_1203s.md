# GOP gets STUNNED as Pissed Off DEMS bring the FIGHT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk)
*  Look, Democrats are bringing the fight now. Yesterday, they were skewering these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA Republicans in public hearings and during interviews on cable news. Watch this as Senator [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=4.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders just laughs in Donald Trump's face, basically mocks Donald Trump because Trump is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=10.72s)]
*  trying to act like he draws bigger crowd sizes than Senator Bernie Sanders and AOC when clearly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and AOC had much bigger crowd sizes than Trump. Just watch Sanders just laugh [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=24.32s)]
*  in Trump's face. Let's play it. They hang on for little bits. They hang on for nuggets [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=29.68s)]
*  and they get crowds. They say, oh, the crowd was our crowds are so much bigger than their crowds. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=36.0s)]
*  Their crowds are small. If I ever had a crowd like their biggest crowd, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=40.96s)]
*  they say it's over for Trump. He's lost the magic. I think you're a little more than four years [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=44.08s)]
*  older than him. Something. I know it will shock the audience. The president did not tell the truth. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=50.64s)]
*  All right. I realize that will shock everybody, but that's the case. And in terms of the, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=57.2s)]
*  not that we want to get into crowd size. Why would anyone want to do that? We had twice the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=63.36s)]
*  turnout in Warren than he had the other night. Then you have Democratic Congress member Dan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Goldman, who looks at his MAGA Republican colleagues in Congress. He's like, do you all have a single [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=73.76s)]
*  independent thought of your own or is it just whatever Donald Trump tells you? Because you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=81.92s)]
*  are all pathetic here. Play this clip. I don't understand how you'll be able to look [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=86.96s)]
*  yourself in the face knowing that you voted to allow our federal government to detain and deport [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=92.24s)]
*  United States citizens simply because you do not want to vote against something that Donald Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  may support. Do you have a thought of your own? Do you have a belief of your own or is everything [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=112.24s)]
*  literally just whatever Donald Trump tells you it should be? Then you have Democratic Congress [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=125.44s)]
*  member Ted Lue, who says the fact that I even have to introduce an amendment that says ICE cannot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=131.44s)]
*  deport US citizens is bat shit crazy. Here play this clip. The fact that Democrats and my colleague, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=140.08s)]
*  representative privilege, I have hell feel the need to even introduce an amendment that says ICE [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=148.56s)]
*  cannot deport your citizens is bat shit crazy. This should not even be a discussion is not even [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=155.68s)]
*  a question. US citizens cannot be deported by ICE. It's the law. It's the constitution. I will be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=163.12s)]
*  astounded if Republicans vote no on this. I yield back. And we have Democratic Congress member [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=172.16s)]
*  Jamie Raskin mocking Donald Trump for having the lowest approval rating ever since polling has [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=181.44s)]
*  really started in presidential history. Play this clip. Mr. Chairman, you know, it must be tough [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=188.72s)]
*  to be an authoritarian. You promise everybody the world to get elected. Prices will go down on day [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=195.76s)]
*  one. No more inflation. We're going to end Russia's war on Ukraine. The world's going to respect us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=201.6s)]
*  And then you get in. And even though you inherit an economy from your predecessor that's described as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  the envy of the world by the Economist magazine, you crash everything. The economy today is shrinking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=213.44s)]
*  The stock market is sinking. Inflation is soaring. Seven trillion dollars in American retirements [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=220.56s)]
*  and wealth has been destroyed. You've plunged us with your imbecilic tariffs into a trade war [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=228.8s)]
*  with the whole world, except of course for your bosom buddies in Russia. So now only 100 days in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=236.32s)]
*  with 100 unforced policy blunders. You're the most unpopular president at this point in your presidency [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=242.64s)]
*  in more than 80 years. Barack Obama stood at 69 percent in the polls. Ronald Reagan was at 73 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=249.6s)]
*  percent in the polls. Truman was 87 percent and Franklin D. Roosevelt 68 percent. But Donald Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=256.0s)]
*  is at 39 percent, the lowest 100-day approval rating since polling began. He controlled the agenda [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=263.52s)]
*  for 100 days. He controlled the House. He controlled the Senate. He's got everything [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=272.0s)]
*  going for him and his numbers are in the gutter. So now I know that you know that I had some pretty [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=275.28s)]
*  bad allergies. I'd read them in the comments and you said, Ben, you got to do something about it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=281.92s)]
*  So I did. I got Alermy. This podcast is sponsored by Alermy. Are your allergies overwhelming you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=286.32s)]
*  Like they were overwhelming me. Alermy has the first and only custom nasal spray to treat your [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=293.52s)]
*  specific symptoms as they treat in mine. Standard meds don't work for everyone and specialists are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=299.28s)]
*  hard to find. Accessible, affordable and effective allergy care from Alermy means you're free to do [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=304.32s)]
*  what you love to do all year long without allergies getting in the way. Don't spend another allergy [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  season suffering after completing a quick online consultation. That's reviewed by Alermy's medical [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  team. They will formulate your unique spray. They'll send you a custom allergy kit with a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  moisturizing saline spray and your custom super spray for fast relief. That's tailored to you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=327.76s)]
*  One of my favorite parts about being an Alermy patient is their app. On-demand expert care is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=334.64s)]
*  very helpful when I need it. Alermy's energy kit is so easy to use. Just a few sprays and I'm done. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  Plus they deliver it directly to me. And again, one of the things I like about it too is it's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=347.2s)]
*  prescription strength. It's FDA approved and it means you get medication that you can trust [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=353.6s)]
*  that really works. I want to just give you our discount code if I can. You head to Alermy.com [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=359.68s)]
*  and you use the code MIDAS. You get 60% off your order. Once again, that's Alermy and then you use [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=365.92s)]
*  our code MIDAS for 60% off and you'll get the promo code MIDAS. So they know I sent you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=372.56s)]
*  Alermy.com. Use the code MIDAS for 60% off your order. One more time. Alermy.com. Alermy.com [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  and use the code MIDAS. Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett also talking about Donald Trump's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  horrific poll numbers. Let's play it. Right now we're cutting jobs as it relates to the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=397.84s)]
*  federal government. Right now because of the failed policies around tariffs, we know that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  we are looking at losing plants. They said that that was going to bring plants. They just announced [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=408.8s)]
*  that we had two auto dealers that were going to shut down approximately 40,000 jobs. As they then [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=413.2s)]
*  go after NIH, we know that in the state of Alabama, the largest employer in the state of Alabama is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=418.8s)]
*  the University of Alabama. They are looking at losing jobs because they won't have research [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=426.16s)]
*  dollars. The only thing that they are doing is hurting us. It is the reason if we're going to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=431.52s)]
*  talk about numbers and mandates, it is the reason that the only person in recent modern times to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=437.04s)]
*  have the lowest approval ratings at their 100-day mark is the same person the first time they were [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=443.36s)]
*  in and now this time. It is time for us to get serious and talk about what will grow our economy, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  what will bring more money in, what will make sure that people can move up from working poor [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=456.16s)]
*  to middle class and maybe even reach this higher level that so many of y'all listen to, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=462.4s)]
*  this upper echelon, this rich level because that is what is supposed to set us apart in this country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  We are supposed to live in a country where everyone has an opportunity to go from rags [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=474.96s)]
*  to literally riches. I am asking my colleagues to start looking out for the people that elected [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=481.76s)]
*  and this is one way that we can do it by supporting this amendment of Ms. Lee and with that I will [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=488.56s)]
*  yield. Then Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman went on Fox. He went into enemy territory and the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=494.08s)]
*  Fox host was so worked up over Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that it's fair game to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=502.08s)]
*  talk about Donald Trump's cognitive decline. Watch this interaction play this clip. I can debate you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=509.68s)]
*  and Ethan is every one of those things you just laid out but I don't think you can call it whatever [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=514.72s)]
*  you want. I think that is an incorrect statement Congressman. I think words have meaning and they [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  matter and I think you know that. I think we have to be careful with our words especially if we are [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  not trying to inflame the public and most certainly if we are trying to arrive at the truth and after [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  four years of having us gaslighted over the competency, the mental acuity of the previous [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  president, it is absurd to question even if you disagree Congressman and clearly you do with much [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  of the president the competency of the sitting president today. I think the accuracy and truth [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=542.4s)]
*  of those words do matter. Well I don't think he's competent Will. I don't know what to tell you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=546.88s)]
*  whether his cognitive abilities are sufficient to get past the 25th amendment. You know we don't know [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=552.16s)]
*  that right now but I think what is clear is that he has driven our country into a disastrous [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=558.72s)]
*  economy. He has undermining the fundamental rule of law and democracy. He is taking away benefits [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=566.96s)]
*  in order to cut taxes for the rich. I think even you Will would have to agree with me that this [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=572.16s)]
*  first hundred days is not at all what he promised the American people. No I'm sorry to notify you. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  I do not agree with you. I think this first hundred days is exactly what he promised the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=584.64s)]
*  American people and more importantly exactly what- Shout out to Democratic Congresswoman [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  Becca Ballant. This is a great part of her speech right here in the House play. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  This is what we want you to open your eyes to. If it can happen as we've said time and time again. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=599.04s)]
*  If it can happen to folks with green cards it can happen to citizens and in Oklahoma City we see a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=606.16s)]
*  perfect example of that. This is what we're talking about. It's not other people. It's us. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  It's our neighbors. It's our friends. It's people who just moved from Maryland to Oklahoma for a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=619.76s)]
*  better life and have their house destroyed and they can't get answers. If we watch the rest of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=625.12s)]
*  the news clip there they're asking ICE who's responsible for this and then they're sending [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=630.64s)]
*  them to another agency and they're sending them to another agency and nobody is accountable for [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=635.92s)]
*  what happened to them. This is what my colleagues are trying to fund with this bill. Armed federal [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=640.88s)]
*  agents breaking into homes even of U.S. citizens traumatizing them taking their possessions. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=650.96s)]
*  This is Trump's America. That's why we continue to talk about due process. It's not some [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  pie in the sky idea. It's what literally holds our country together without due process without the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=671.2s)]
*  belief in the Constitution. We are not Americans. That's what gives us the ability to say we are an [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=677.84s)]
*  exceptional country in the world that everyone who lives here gets due process. And we're going to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=687.76s)]
*  keep saying this over and over and over again for everyone who lives here. What happened to that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=696.08s)]
*  family? Back to Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. Let's play it. So this amendment [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=705.52s)]
*  specifically deals with issues around the consumer price index. So let's talk about the price of eggs [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=710.48s)]
*  because for whatever reason we've yet to have a hearing on the price of eggs when that was really [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  the one big thing. And I remember the big guy that's in the White House saying that he was [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=721.92s)]
*  going to reduce the cost of eggs on day one. But what we see is that the national average price of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=725.92s)]
*  eggs in March of 2025 was $6.23, a 6% increase from the previous month, a 60% increase year to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=731.52s)]
*  year and USDA said egg prices could climb 41% this year. When we start to talk about things such as [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=742.24s)]
*  our energy in March, natural gas prices increased 3.6% and electricity prices increased 9%. Fuel and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  oil prices increased 0.8%. Utility gas services increased 2.5%. The national average for a gallon [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=760.48s)]
*  of gas is currently $3.17, nowhere near the $1.98 that President Trump claimed last week. I just [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=768.88s)]
*  want to make sure we get the facts out there. And finally- Then you had Democratic Congressmember [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=778.64s)]
*  Kassar. Let's watch what he's got to say. Let's play it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=784.72s)]
*  You're recognized. Five minutes to explain his amendment. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=787.44s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, the Republicans on this committee just voted no on canceling Elon Musk's contracts [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=790.64s)]
*  if he violates the law and stays past 130 days. The Republicans on this committee just voted no [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=798.96s)]
*  on Mr. Frost's amendment that would require the President of the United States to follow US Supreme [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=805.2s)]
*  Court orders. At some point, we've got to have some shame on this committee. So my amendment, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=810.48s)]
*  I would hope my Republican colleagues would vote for it, is that if a court or the federal government [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=818.24s)]
*  finds that Mr. Musk abused his power to enrich himself here over the last few months, then we [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  would cancel his contracts. If a court finds that the richest man on earth went in, used the federal [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=831.04s)]
*  books, scraped people's data, steered contracts to himself, then we should maybe stop sending him [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=838.64s)]
*  $8 million a day and save the American taxpayer $3 billion. That's the way that not just Democrats, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=844.48s)]
*  but conservatives, progressives, independents all across the country want to see us save some money [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=851.84s)]
*  by saying these corporate grifters that use the government to enrich themselves, they should get [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=857.68s)]
*  cut off. And look, there's a House Republican majority today, but there could be a Democratic [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=862.56s)]
*  majority tomorrow, or at least in under two years. And when we are sitting on this committee, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=867.92s)]
*  and if we get a chance to have the subpoena power and look into this and find out that Elon Musk [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=873.68s)]
*  has used his power to enrich himself, the consequences could actually be much greater [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=879.04s)]
*  than just having his contracts cut off. Democratic Governor of Kentucky, Andy Bashir, went on Fox and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=883.68s)]
*  he was just spitting facts. Let's play this clip. I think we can always try to be more efficient. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=892.56s)]
*  I think we can always try to be more effective, but there's a difference in trying to fix something [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=897.92s)]
*  and break something and coming in and doing a 40% cut across the board without looking at who has [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  the expertise about who has the leadership about what programs are being impacted. I think is very [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  short-sighted. I think there is a way to do this. I think presidents of both parties in the past [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=915.28s)]
*  have done it well, but this approach I think was callous in telling people that have served for a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=919.76s)]
*  decade that they're being fired because of poor work performance when we know it isn't true. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=925.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. You have to go case by case to make sure that that person was performing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=929.92s)]
*  up to par and that they were actually doing a good job and they were actually bettering [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  the situation for the American people. The administration and the president said many times [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=939.12s)]
*  that he will not take away Medicaid or Medicare or social security benefits from anyone who has [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=943.04s)]
*  earned them and that the goal is to find the waste, fraud and abuse in these programs, which we know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=949.52s)]
*  exists. So do you have any problem with cutting waste and fraud and abuse from the Medicaid program? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=954.96s)]
*  Don't you think that's a good idea? So first on the last question, when you see tens of thousands [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  of letters that all have the exact same thing to hardworking federal employees and veterans, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=968.16s)]
*  you know it's an excuse and not the reason. On Medicaid and Medicare, the way you root out [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=973.76s)]
*  abuse, I know I was attorney general, we had a Medicaid fraud unit and you look for those providers [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=979.28s)]
*  that are over billing, that are doing wrong, that are charging for things that are never happening. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. But if what you do are just major cuts to preserve some tax cut that provides states [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  significantly less money that's needed, just watch, that rural hospital will close. When you look at [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  the amount of their revenue that is covered by Medicaid, they simply can't exist without it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1003.6s)]
*  And rural Americans deserve to see a doctor in their own community. They shouldn't have to drive [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1009.6s)]
*  hours just to see a primary care doctor, much less a specialist. But you can see that the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1014.0s)]
*  administration has said that they will not cut services from Medicaid. That's what he has said repeatedly. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1018.08s)]
*  I think what you see is Congress looking at that and remember you can say you're not going to cut [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1023.76s)]
*  services, but if you cut the overall amount going to states, then you make the state. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1028.8s)]
*  So I want you to take what I just showed you and contrast it with Donald Trump's surrogates who [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1033.36s)]
*  were going on cable yesterday. Like they had Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's commerce secretary [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  who was whining about how Europe and Australia and all these other countries, he goes, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1045.12s)]
*  we have the best beef and they treat our beef so poorly or we're being treated so badly. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, come on. Like the nonsense I have to listen to. I'm sure. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1056.72s)]
*  Right. These are what they do is they take out comments from 25 years ago that they're keeping [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1060.16s)]
*  doing. Our beef is excellent. Our poultry is excellent. Our row crops are excellent. Stop [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1065.68s)]
*  treating us poorly. And then you have Donald Trump's trade secretary, his lead trade representative, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1072.64s)]
*  Greer. And here he talks about how he hasn't even had one single conversation [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1081.68s)]
*  with his counterpart in China. There's been zero conversations [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1088.56s)]
*  with China's trade representatives. Play this clip. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1092.32s)]
*  ...needers level with the president, the prime minister, but we stand ready to engage in this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1094.64s)]
*  Last thing, for the people who look at this policy and say, this is designed to put pressure on China, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1098.08s)]
*  it's all designed to kind of put the squeeze on China. Is that a fair assessment? Are you [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1104.24s)]
*  trying to get China to the table in a weakened negotiating state because that's the biggest [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1110.8000000000002s)]
*  adversary? I think that's a very Washington thing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1115.76s)]
*  Look at it. I think it is. But for me, we're worried about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1118.72s)]
*  the United States of America. We have this giant trade deficit. We have offshore manufacturing. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  Our ag exports are way down. It's affecting normal people in the country. We want them [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1128.4s)]
*  to have jobs. We want them to have opportunities. Obviously, China is a huge part of this, and we [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1134.0s)]
*  want to make sure that we have fair trade with China. And they're not official talks yet, right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1138.24s)]
*  Not yet. Not yet. I did speak with my counterpart before April 2nd for a long time, over an hour. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1143.52s)]
*  It was a virtual meeting, but I thought it was constructive. This is not a plan just to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1149.84s)]
*  encircle China. It's a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1154.88s)]
*  as GDP, to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy that's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1159.84s)]
*  financed by the government. We want to make real stuff and sell it. And it means we have [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1166.32s)]
*  to deal with foreign trade practices that are harmful, including in China and elsewhere. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  So for the companies. So pick your fighter. Okay? I think I showed you a group of intelligent [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  Democrats pushing back, fighting back, coming with the facts. And I think that's the fight we all [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1180.08s)]
*  wanted to see. Anyway, let me know what you think. Hit subscribe. Let's get to 5 million subscribers. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Zy59XqJYk&t=1186.64s)]
