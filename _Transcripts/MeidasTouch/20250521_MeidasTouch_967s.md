# Trump BLOWS UP in PRESSER with SOUTH AFRICA PREZ
**MeidasTouch:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE)
*  Wow, what a disaster. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump had South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office today. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=1.52s)]
*  This thing went sideways really quickly. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=6.32s)]
*  Watch as the president of South Africa tells Donald Trump that unlike Qatar, he can't give [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=8.76s)]
*  Donald Trump a gold-plated private jet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=16.64s)]
*  That idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=17.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=21.88s)]
*  I wish you did. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=24.72s)]
*  I would take it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=25.72s)]
*  I would take it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=27.48s)]
*  If your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=28.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=32.0s)]
*  And did you hear Donald Trump say, well, I would like another private jet? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=33.0s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=38.12s)]
*  Then throughout this press conference in the Oval Office, Donald Trump kept on blowing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=39.12s)]
*  up at an NBC reporter in front of the president of South Africa and the other delegation from [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=42.92s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=48.84s)]
*  This whole site was humiliating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=50.08s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=51.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=52.92s)]
*  Mr. President, the Pentagon announced that it would be accepting a Qatari jet to be used [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=53.92s)]
*  as an Air Force one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, you to get out of here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=64.12s)]
*  What does this have to do with the Qatari jet? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=67.12s)]
*  They're giving the United States Air Force a jet, okay? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=72.72s)]
*  And it's a great thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=76.64s)]
*  We're talking about a lot of other things. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=77.64s)]
*  It's NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=80.24s)]
*  You are a real, you know, you're a terrible reporter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=83.44s)]
*  Number one, you don't have what it takes to be a reporter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  You're not smart enough. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  But for you to go onto a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  which is a very nice thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=95.6s)]
*  They also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment in addition to the jet. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=97.08s)]
*  Go back, you ought to go back to your studio at NBC because Brian Roberts and the people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=103.88s)]
*  that run that place, they ought to be investigated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=109.72s)]
*  They are so terrible the way you run that network. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=113.0s)]
*  And you're a disgrace. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=116.52s)]
*  No more questions from you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=117.64s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=118.64s)]
*  Go ahead, talk about that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=119.64s)]
*  His name is Peter Something. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=124.64s)]
*  He's a terrible reporter. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=126.44s)]
*  Quiet, quiet, quiet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=128.44s)]
*  I mean, the United States is really just looking so clownish to the international community [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=131.24s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=136.8s)]
*  And no offense to clowns with things like this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=137.8s)]
*  So then Donald Trump starts taking out a series of articles to spread the lie that there is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=139.84s)]
*  a genocide in South Africa against the white Afrikaner farmers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=144.96s)]
*  And then the president of South Africa is there also with the white agriculture minister [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=151.12s)]
*  who also knows that there is not a genocide against the white farmers in South Africa. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=156.6s)]
*  But Donald Trump keeps pulling these like conspiracy-laden articles. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=162.44s)]
*  Here, watch what he does play this clip. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=166.32s)]
*  What would you like President Ramaphosa to do about the situation that we've just seen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=168.12s)]
*  on the screen? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=173.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=174.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=175.44s)]
*  Look, these are articles over the last few days. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=176.44s)]
*  Death of people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=180.88s)]
*  Death. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=183.88s)]
*  Death. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=184.88s)]
*  Death. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=185.88s)]
*  Horrible death. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=186.88s)]
*  Death. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=187.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=188.88s)]
*  To pick anyone. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=189.88s)]
*  White South Africans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=190.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=192.44s)]
*  To pick anyone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=193.44s)]
*  White South Africans are fleeing because of the violence and racist laws. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=195.16s)]
*  And this is all, I mean I'll give these to you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=201.64s)]
*  So when you say what would I like to do, I don't know what to do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=204.68s)]
*  Just look at this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=208.04s)]
*  White South African couples say that they were attacked violently. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=209.32s)]
*  Well, I could do that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=213.32s)]
*  Look, here's burial sites all over the place. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=217.84s)]
*  These are all white farmers that are being burned. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=220.48s)]
*  And he asks about a jet that was given. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=222.92s)]
*  You ought to be ashamed of yourself. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=225.56s)]
*  You know, you are so bad. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=227.56s)]
*  You're such a bad reporter. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=229.2s)]
*  And then there's more of Donald Trump blowing up at and attacking an NBC reporter and calling [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=231.32s)]
*  the NBC reporter a jerk. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=236.64s)]
*  Like you can see Trump's face turn like bright orange as well here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=242.0s)]
*  Talk about it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=243.0s)]
*  And I didn't know we'd get involved here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=244.0s)]
*  But I will say this, that if the news wasn't fake like NBC, which is fake news, totally [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=246.64s)]
*  one of the worst, ABC, NBC, CBS, horrible. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=252.32s)]
*  But if they weren't fake news like this jerk that we have here, if we had real reporters, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  they'd be covering it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=262.0s)]
*  But the fake news in this country doesn't talk about that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=263.0s)]
*  So then the reporters keep asking Donald Trump and you have international reporters, they're [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=267.56s)]
*  from South Africa and others saying to Donald Trump, what will it take to convince you that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=272.2s)]
*  there is not a genocide against white Afrikaners and white farmers in South Africa? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=277.72s)]
*  I mean, you literally have the white agriculture minister who's not from President Ramaphosa's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=283.12s)]
*  party here saying that there isn't one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=289.24s)]
*  What's it going to take? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=291.92s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=292.92s)]
*  So then Donald Trump has a video that he's made or that his regime has made to further [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=293.92s)]
*  spread the lies that there's burial sites for this genocide that is not taking place. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=318.52s)]
*  And you have the president of South Africa Ramaphosa sitting there saying, what is it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=324.64s)]
*  What are you showing me? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=329.68s)]
*  I'm the president of South Africa. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=330.68s)]
*  I don't know what the hell you're talking about here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=331.88s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, this is very bad. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  These are burial sites right here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  Burial sites. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=342.44s)]
*  Over a thousand of white farmers and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=344.44s)]
*  morning. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=353.16s)]
*  Each one of those white things you see is a cross and there's approximately a thousand [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=354.16s)]
*  of them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=362.08s)]
*  They're all white farmers, the family of white farmers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=363.08s)]
*  And those cars aren't driving, they're stopped there to pay respects to their family member [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=366.8s)]
*  who was killed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=371.92s)]
*  And it's a terrible site. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=376.36s)]
*  Both sides of the road you have crosses. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=380.88s)]
*  Those people are all killed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=392.88s)]
*  Have they told you where that is, Mr. President? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=393.88s)]
*  No, I'd like to know where that is. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=396.88s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=398.84s)]
*  I've been to South Africa this week. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=401.84s)]
*  So then President Ramaphosa of South Africa tells Donald Trump, he goes, I can assure [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=409.44s)]
*  you that if there was an Afrikaner farmer genocide, the three white Afrikaner and other [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=413.52s)]
*  white agriculture ministers and opposition party leaders who are here in the Oval Office [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=421.56s)]
*  from South Africa right now, Donald, they would tell you they're standing here right [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=427.76s)]
*  now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=432.36s)]
*  Here, watch this moment here, play this clip. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=433.36s)]
*  It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=435.36s)]
*  are his good friends, like those who are here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=443.36s)]
*  When we have talks between us on the quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=446.36s)]
*  to them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=452.48s)]
*  I'm not going to be repeating what I've been saying. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  I would say if there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=457.32s)]
*  would not be here, including my Minister of Agriculture. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=464.36s)]
*  He would not be with me. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=468.68s)]
*  So it will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  That is the answer to your question. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=478.04s)]
*  Mr. President, I must say that we have thousands of stories talking about it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=480.6s)]
*  We have documentaries, we have news stories. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  Is Natalie here, somebody here to turn that? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  I could show you a couple of things. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=496.36s)]
*  It has to be responded to. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  Let me see the articles, please, if you would. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=503.76s)]
*  And turn the lights down. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene's boyfriend is in the Oval Office, and he's one of the people who [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=509.16s)]
*  asked these questions. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=513.88s)]
*  Remember, he was the guy who attacked Zelensky and said, why aren't you wearing a suit, is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=514.88s)]
*  what Glenn said. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=520.36s)]
*  So here, Brian Glenn asked this ridiculous question. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=521.36s)]
*  But then President Ramaphousev of South Africa says, why don't I direct this question to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=524.12s)]
*  the agriculture minister who's white, who's here, he'll answer this question. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=530.24s)]
*  He's from the opposition. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=537.52s)]
*  He's part of my cabinet. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=538.6s)]
*  Here, let him answer the question. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=540.4s)]
*  Watch this clip. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=542.24s)]
*  Numbers of people that want to leave South Africa because they feel they're going to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=543.24s)]
*  be dead very soon. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=546.12s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=547.12s)]
*  Brian, go ahead. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=548.12s)]
*  I'm just asking a question. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=549.12s)]
*  72% of farmers in your country are white. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=552.12s)]
*  If they flee, do you feel that maybe the economy could collapse? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=555.12s)]
*  You may not have a gap to fill in those people that need to replace those farmers. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=559.12s)]
*  You know, I'd like my minister of agriculture. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=564.12s)]
*  Who is white, who comes from opposition party to mine, who has joined my government at my [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=567.72s)]
*  invitation to address this very issue, including the question that you've just raised. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=576.72s)]
*  John? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=584.72s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=585.72s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for welcoming us to the White House. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=586.72s)]
*  I would say we have a real safe problem in South Africa. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=589.72s)]
*  I don't think anyone wants to candy coat that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=592.72s)]
*  It requires a lot of effort to get on top of it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=596.32s)]
*  It's going to require more policing resources. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=599.32s)]
*  It's going to require a different strategy to be able to deal with it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=601.32s)]
*  But certainly the majority of South Africa's commercial and small-holder farmers really [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=604.32s)]
*  do want to stay in South Africa and make it work. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=609.32s)]
*  I've just come from the largest agricultural show in the southern hemisphere with organized [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=612.32s)]
*  agriculture and farmers, and the majority of them want to stay. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=616.32s)]
*  But they, too, there have a memorial to those who've died as a result of farm attacks. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=619.32s)]
*  As the Minister of Agriculture, it is something that I particularly exercised with my colleagues [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  at the police and my colleagues in the justice cluster to start making farm attacks and stock [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=630.4200000000001s)]
*  theft a priority crime. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  And it affects all farmers in South Africa, particularly stock theft. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=638.4200000000001s)]
*  It has a disproportionate effect on small-holder black farmers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  Then Donald Trump mentions that Elon is from South Africa. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=645.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm here today. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=649.52s)]
*  I have many friends from South Africa, but many of those friends are, they can't go back. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=650.52s)]
*  I have, Elon is from South Africa. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=657.52s)]
*  I don't want to get Elon involved. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=659.52s)]
*  That's all I have to do, get him into another thing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=661.52s)]
*  But Elon happens to be from South Africa. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=664.52s)]
*  This is what Elon wanted. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=667.52s)]
*  He actually came here on a different subject, sending rockets to Mars, okay? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=669.52s)]
*  He likes that better. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=673.52s)]
*  He likes that subject better. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=674.52s)]
*  Elon is from South Africa. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=676.62s)]
*  I don't want to talk to him about that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=678.62s)]
*  I don't think it's fair to him. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=680.62s)]
*  Mr. President, you've welcomed white Afrikaner refugees here. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=686.62s)]
*  Can you explain to Americans why it's appropriate to welcome white Afrikaners here [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=690.62s)]
*  when other refugees like Afghans, Venezuelans, Haitians have all had their protective status [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=694.62s)]
*  approved of? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=701.62s)]
*  This is a group, NBC, that is truly fake news. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=703.72s)]
*  They ask a lot of questions in a very pointed way. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=707.72s)]
*  They're not questions, they're statements. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=710.72s)]
*  Then Donald Trump randomly thinks that it's a good idea to attack the New York Attorney General [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=713.72s)]
*  Letitia James in this Oval Office meeting with the President of South Africa? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=719.72s)]
*  I'd like to read your thoughts on Letitia James. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=725.72s)]
*  He's Director Pulte, according to him. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=728.82s)]
*  Letitia James says that the alleged mortgage fraud was simply a mistake. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=731.82s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=737.82s)]
*  Did you put down that her father was her husband in the order? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=739.82s)]
*  And this is very similar to, I guess, the false attacks they have on here. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=744.82s)]
*  Well, I don't know what it is currently, but Letitia James, who is the Attorney General [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=748.82s)]
*  of New York State, it seemed, I'm not involved in that at all. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=752.82s)]
*  It's being handled by various groups, I guess, but it's major fraud, mortgage documents, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=756.9200000000001s)]
*  and fraudulent everything. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  I think she said the father was her husband, which she had to have a husband. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  So she chose her father, and she put it down. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  Didn't she sign in Virginia? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  She said she lived in Virginia, and yet she's the New York State Attorney General. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=780.9200000000001s)]
*  She did that for tax reasons so she could take advantage of taxes. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=786.02s)]
*  And she had the wrong number of units. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=790.02s)]
*  She had a much different number, which wouldn't have allowed her to qualify and scam the government. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=792.02s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=798.02s)]
*  I think she's very bad for New York, but I really don't know too much about it, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=800.02s)]
*  but I appreciate the question. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=803.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=804.02s)]
*  And then you have some of the other ministers there with President Ramaphosa explaining, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=806.02s)]
*  look, we have too many deaths in general in South Africa. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=812.02s)]
*  There's gang violence in South Africa the way you have gang violence in the United States. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=815.12s)]
*  And it's not specifically gang violence targeted at white people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=820.12s)]
*  There's a lot of black farmers who are targeted as well. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=824.12s)]
*  I mean, there's violence. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=827.12s)]
*  So we would like to have the support from the United States and from the international community [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=829.12s)]
*  to help as well. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=835.12s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=836.12s)]
*  Look how he's changed. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=838.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=840.12s)]
*  We have too many deaths, but it's across the board. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=842.22s)]
*  It's not only white farmers. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=845.22s)]
*  It's across the board. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=847.22s)]
*  And we need technological help. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=849.22s)]
*  We need Starlink at every little police station. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=853.22s)]
*  We need drones. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=857.22s)]
*  I actually got drones donated for the peace parks to stop elephant and rhino poaching. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=859.22s)]
*  And his predecessor stopped the importation because he said the United States would spy on us. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=869.32s)]
*  I mean, US SpaceX would ridicule. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=876.32s)]
*  So if we can, if you can help us. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=880.32s)]
*  Remember, sir, you and I lived in New York in the 70s. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=884.32s)]
*  We never thought New York could be what it became. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=888.32s)]
*  Two commissioners, a tough mayor. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=892.32s)]
*  We need your help to stop this awful killing, but it's across the board. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, and as I watch this disaster in the Oval Office unfold, I just think about what's going on in Beijing right now, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=900.4200000000001s)]
*  where Xi Jinping must have the biggest smile on his face and think about how the bricks block is going to be strengthened, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=908.4200000000001s)]
*  how America looks so unreliable and weird to the international community. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=916.4200000000001s)]
*  It looks like a pariah regime, like a Kim Jong-un-like regime with Donald Trump orange-faced, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=921.52s)]
*  exploding at reporters, holding up weird articles, you know, and we're just like speeding up the rise of China. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=927.52s)]
*  It's a ridiculous, it's objectively, no matter what political party you're from, you should look at this and go, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=935.52s)]
*  what in the world just happened here? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACOeGAfiIE&t=941.52s)]
