# Trump gets RUDE AWAKENING as GOP BLOWS UP his Bill
**MeidasTouch:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU)
*  Is this MAGA Republican budget bill blowing up already? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=0.0s)]
*  They're calling it a big, beautiful bill, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=3.74s)]
*  but it looks like a big, beautiful disaster. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=5.7s)]
*  MAGA Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=8.66s)]
*  was on right-wing propaganda media today, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=11.8s)]
*  and he was sending a message saying, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=15.26s)]
*  we don't know what the hell these MAGAs are doing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=17.14s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=19.2s)]
*  but we ain't supportin' what they're doin' in the Senate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=20.46s)]
*  That was an interesting note. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=22.94s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Arguing over additional tax provisions [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=25.66s)]
*  and getting down to a reasonable pre-pandemic spending level, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=28.5s)]
*  but that's not the path we chose. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  So I think the sooner we acknowledge the fact [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=33.1s)]
*  that this current effort is doomed to fail. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=35.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, I've gotta just read the press on this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=38.14s)]
*  It's doomed to fail. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=41.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna vote for it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=42.58s)]
*  I know a number of senators who will not even come, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=43.54s)]
*  but I'm contemplating. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=46.26s)]
*  This is a non-star. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=47.34s)]
*  Right now, as it's being written, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=48.459999999999994s)]
*  we would actually increase the deficit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  I don't think many people realize [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=53.94s)]
*  that we would actually increase the deficit. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  That's a complete non-starter. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=57.62s)]
*  So no, we're not even close. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=58.8s)]
*  It's not memorial. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=60.76s)]
*  But if you were to listen to MAGA Mike Johnson [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  and some of the reporting we did earlier in the day, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=64.36s)]
*  you would say, it's all going well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=67.36s)]
*  It's one big, beautiful bill. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=68.72s)]
*  The beautiful bill is so big. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=69.84s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=71.1s)]
*  It's going amazing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=72.12s)]
*  So the other tack that I guess this Trump regime [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=72.96s)]
*  is taking now is that when they send their people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  to even show up before committees that oversee budgets, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=79.02s)]
*  whether that's in the House of Representatives or the Senate, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=83.5s)]
*  they don't even do their homework. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  And when I was watching this clip of Kash Patel, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  who's somehow the FBI director showing up [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=91.56s)]
*  in front of the Senate without submitting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=93.8s)]
*  the most basic outline of what the FBI budget is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=97.46s)]
*  and seeing Senator Murray say, where's the budget? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Can I look at it? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=104.1s)]
*  And Kash Patel's like, it's not ready. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=105.32s)]
*  It just reminds me of the kid who just doesn't do his homework [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  at the most basic level. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  It's just like competency. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm gonna watch this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=115.34s)]
*  I have a timeline on that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  It was due last week by law. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=117.74s)]
*  I understand. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=120.02s)]
*  And your answer is you just understand [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=121.7s)]
*  you're not gonna follow the law? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=123.1s)]
*  My answer is that I am following the law [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=125.0s)]
*  and I'm working with my interagency partners to do this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=126.9s)]
*  and get you the budget that you are required to have. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=129.82s)]
*  And you have no timeline? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=132.9s)]
*  No. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=135.14s)]
*  And you know, the MAGA Republicans though in the House [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=136.5s)]
*  were focused on all the most important pressing issues [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=138.86s)]
*  as our economy is shrinking, as Main Street, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=141.34s)]
*  as regular folk, regular Americans are suffering, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=146.34s)]
*  as Donald Trump is saying, you're little girls, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=149.5s)]
*  give them one doll only, five pencils. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=152.62s)]
*  That's what Trump regime central planning is saying. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=155.96s)]
*  Here's what they were focused on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=159.58s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=160.76s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=162.46s)]
*  who launched her massive Doge hearing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=165.32s)]
*  on USA fencing yesterday, followed up [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=168.16s)]
*  with a doozy here, play this clip. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=170.44s)]
*  Honored to be here today in front of the American people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  as we debate the merits of the Gulf of America Act. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=177.64s)]
*  This would rename the body of water formerly known [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=181.68s)]
*  as the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  This is such an important thing to do [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=188.18s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=190.2s)]
*  The American people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=191.34s)]
*  It's about as much as I can handle of hearing her voice. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=192.88s)]
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congress member, Brandon Boyle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=195.2s)]
*  Congress member Boyle, you're the ranking member [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=198.84s)]
*  on the Budget Committee, but let's, I guess, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=202.28s)]
*  first talk about the status of the budget, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=204.46s)]
*  what's going on there, then let's move in, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=207.8s)]
*  talk about the economy and some other things. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=210.28s)]
*  When you see all those clips, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=212.04s)]
*  what the hell is going on here? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=213.4s)]
*  When I see all those clips, I think, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=216.24s)]
*  my God, why did I run for Congress? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Why am I doing this and calling someone [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=220.56s)]
*  like Marjorie Taylor Greene a colleague? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=222.84s)]
*  Aside from rethinking my life's choices, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  I will say that in terms of the budget [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=228.54s)]
*  and the big, beautiful bill for billionaires [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=230.82s)]
*  that Donald Trump and Mike Johnson are pushing, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=234.7s)]
*  I think at this moment, well, there are two things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  First, Republicans have scheduled markups, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=241.22s)]
*  basically voting committee meetings [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=244.34s)]
*  in a few very important committees, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=247.1s)]
*  including Ways and Means on which I serve [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  and Budget Committee also on which I serve [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=251.98s)]
*  as the lead Democrat or ranking member. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  Ways and Means has been scheduled for Tuesday of next week [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=257.1s)]
*  and Budget has been scheduled for Friday. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=260.26000000000005s)]
*  However, despite their scheduling those voting meetings, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=262.54s)]
*  I have to say at this moment, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=266.1s)]
*  I don't think they're anywhere close to having a final bill [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=267.98s)]
*  and here's why. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  Ron Johnson, who's a very conservative Senator [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  from Wisconsin, a conspiracy theorist, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=275.56s)]
*  he alluded to the fact and quite accurately, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=278.18s)]
*  they are badly internally divided on the other side. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=281.72s)]
*  They're divided on Medicaid cuts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=284.62s)]
*  You have a group in the House led by the Freedom Caucus [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=288.06s)]
*  who continue to push the largest cuts to Medicaid [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=291.22s)]
*  in American history. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=293.9s)]
*  It would absolutely devastate the program. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=294.9s)]
*  You have some moderate Republicans [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  who want no cuts to Medicaid or very small cuts. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=298.98s)]
*  You also have the SALT issue, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=302.32s)]
*  the ability to deduct state and local income taxes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=304.02s)]
*  When that cap came into place by Donald Trump [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=307.58s)]
*  and Republicans eight years ago, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  it basically became a middle-class tax increase [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=311.66s)]
*  in places like Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=314.38s)]
*  New York, California, Virginia and some other states. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=317.42s)]
*  So those are two of the big issues [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=322.18s)]
*  for internal disagreements between House Republicans [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=324.62s)]
*  and Senate Republicans, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=327.54s)]
*  also within the House Republican Conference. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=328.82s)]
*  So at this moment, I have to say, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=331.34s)]
*  unless real progress is made over the next 48 hours, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=333.26s)]
*  I do not believe the happy talk from Mike Johnson [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  and I'll believe that we really have a vote next week [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=339.64s)]
*  when I say it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=343.4s)]
*  I wanna share this next clip with you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=345.84s)]
*  as we talk about the overall state of our economy right now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  The Trump propaganda machine before the election, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=351.76s)]
*  they would have these MAGA parents [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  dress up their little girls in the MAGA shirts [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=359.32s)]
*  and they would talk about how Trump was gonna [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  make their Barbies cheaper. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=366.08s)]
*  This was actually part of the campaign [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=368.12s)]
*  that Trump was running here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=369.96s)]
*  Let me show you this clip for example. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=371.0s)]
*  What do you want him to do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you want him to say today? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=374.56s)]
*  I want him to lower prices and lower the taxes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=378.4s)]
*  and make Barbies cheaper. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=385.84s)]
*  Make Barbies cheaper? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=389.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=390.4s)]
*  Tell me more about that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=391.24s)]
*  Have they gotten expensive? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=392.06s)]
*  Yeah and Polly pockets. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=393.36s)]
*  All my favorite toys are so expensive. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=395.08s)]
*  And now you got this guy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=398.32s)]
*  You got Trump up there literally saying [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=400.6s)]
*  while he's doing deals with the Abu Dhabi fund [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=403.04s)]
*  for his crypto and Trump resorts in Qatar, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  I saw a report, the Trump family's net worth increased [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  by $2.6 billion just over the past 100 days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=412.0s)]
*  He says little girls you get, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=416.24s)]
*  I can't believe I'm actually quoting the guy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=418.12s)]
*  He's like you get two dolls and five pencils [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=420.68s)]
*  and they'll cost more and you shouldn't complain about it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  What do you make about all that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  But more seriously just the state of the economy right now [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  and how main streets feel it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I have an 11 year old daughter. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=431.76s)]
*  Good luck telling my daughter [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=433.48s)]
*  that she will get two dolls and five pencils. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=436.24s)]
*  By the way, I think she'll happily trade the pencils [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=439.0s)]
*  from where dolls is my impression [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=441.72s)]
*  at least based on one 11 year old girl. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=444.4s)]
*  The reality is that Donald Trump [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=447.16s)]
*  is probably the greatest con man in American history. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=449.72s)]
*  And he was able to convince a lot of people, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=453.76s)]
*  especially in my state of Pennsylvania, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=456.8s)]
*  that he would actually bring down costs [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=459.64s)]
*  and make their lives better. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=462.12s)]
*  And just the last three months, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=464.08s)]
*  the exact opposite has happened. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=465.32s)]
*  And this isn't my opinion. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=467.0s)]
*  We don't have to take my word for it [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=468.96s)]
*  or any Democrats word for it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  Just last week, Trump's own labor department [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=472.56s)]
*  released the receipts the first quarter, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=476.28s)]
*  contrary to everyone's prediction a few months ago, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=479.32s)]
*  the economy actually contracted. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  We are right now in a recession. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=484.44s)]
*  No one was predicting that no conservative economists, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=486.8s)]
*  no liberal economists, no one was predicting that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=490.4s)]
*  We're in a recession. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=492.84s)]
*  We are in a contracting economy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  And at the same time, prices are going up. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Inflation jumped from the low 2% range to the mid threes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=499.64s)]
*  That's the biggest jump we've seen since the COVID pandemic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=503.32s)]
*  So this economy is in a bad place [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=506.76s)]
*  and it is entirely because of Trump's tariffs. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=508.64s)]
*  And everyone knows that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  No amount, even the greatest con man [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=513.52s)]
*  in the history of America, Donald Trump, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=515.52s)]
*  can't get people to believe things that are so contrary [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=517.8s)]
*  to their own lives and their own experiences. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=521.4799999999999s)]
*  So there's a reason why Trump's approval rating [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=524.68s)]
*  has actually dropped faster than any new president [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  in the history of polling. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think it's going to continue to get worse [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  because in all likelihood, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=533.68s)]
*  the quarter that we're in right now, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  the data will actually come out and show [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  that things are far worse than even it was [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=540.4s)]
*  in the first quarter, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=542.4s)]
*  because we're just now starting to see the full impact [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  of the Trump massive tariffs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=546.64s)]
*  You know, I've called this Trump regime [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=549.0s)]
*  the Ponzi scheme presidency or the rug pull presidency. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=550.76s)]
*  And it seems rather than unlocking [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=554.84s)]
*  actually how to benefit the people, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=557.52s)]
*  in his own mind, he's like, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=559.4s)]
*  oh, I can unlock a new Ponzi scheme and a new scam. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=560.8s)]
*  And the new one that he seems to do [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=565.12s)]
*  was that he's realized with his tariff war [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=567.04s)]
*  against the world, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=569.08s)]
*  that if he makes certain statements about a new deal, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=570.6s)]
*  it impacts the markets. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=574.04s)]
*  And the markets get manipulated based on his statements. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  And there's incredible volatility, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=579.4s)]
*  but people can make a lot of money on it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=581.76s)]
*  So he'll say something like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=583.88s)]
*  I did a trade deal with the UK. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=585.0s)]
*  He didn't do a trade deal with the UK. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=587.24s)]
*  He talked about doing something with Range Rovers [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  and that the price of a Range Rover goes from 20% tariffs, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=592.04s)]
*  25 to 10%, when they were 0% a while ago. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=596.16s)]
*  He's like, we're talking to China, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=599.4s)]
*  when he was not talking to China, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=601.52s)]
*  and then he'll attack China. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  And to me, then you have this market volatility, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=605.0s)]
*  which also abstracts the GDP contraction [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=608.68s)]
*  and all these other systemic issues that you're seeing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=612.32s)]
*  So what do you think along those lines around the kind of, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=616.08s)]
*  what's going on in the markets [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=619.84s)]
*  and what's going on in people's kitchen tables? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=621.36s)]
*  Well, again, here are the numbers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=624.6s)]
*  I mean, the Dow Jones, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=626.04s)]
*  down since the Trump presidency began. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=627.4s)]
*  S&P 500, down since the Trump presidency began. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=629.6s)]
*  NASDAQ down since the Trump presidency began. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=632.68s)]
*  All of those were up just a few months ago. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=635.4s)]
*  There's a tremendous amount of volatility. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=638.04s)]
*  And we're actually seeing, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=640.36s)]
*  at the beginning of the year, again, just a few months ago, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=642.88s)]
*  everyone was projecting there would be three Fed cuts [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=646.88s)]
*  of about 75 basis points. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=649.96s)]
*  So that would have a dramatic impact [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=652.0s)]
*  in lowering people's mortgages [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=653.68s)]
*  and lowering people's auto loans. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=655.48s)]
*  Now the likelihood is we won't have any Fed cuts. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=657.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  Because of the Trump inflation that he caused [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=662.58s)]
*  as a result of his tariffs. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=664.62s)]
*  As far as trade deals, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=666.38s)]
*  I mean, I mentioned before I serve [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=667.58s)]
*  on Ways and Means Committee, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=669.14s)]
*  I'm on the trade subcommittee. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=670.62s)]
*  We have jurisdiction over that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=672.34s)]
*  So I will have the opportunity to review [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=673.6999999999999s)]
*  this so-called US UK trade deal. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=676.58s)]
*  Look, I would welcome a trade deal with the European Union, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=679.58s)]
*  which is a market of almost 500 million people, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=683.9s)]
*  a trade deal with the UK, a trade deal with Canada, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=686.7s)]
*  trade deal with Mexico. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  But Donald Trump announcing that he has a trade agreement [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=692.3399999999999s)]
*  is a little like the arsonist claiming credit [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=696.04s)]
*  for putting out one of the fires he started. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  After all, Donald Trump is the person who came in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=702.42s)]
*  and slapped tariffs on all these countries. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=704.3s)]
*  We already had a trade deal with Canada in operation. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=706.86s)]
*  It was one actually Donald Trump negotiated [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=710.0999999999999s)]
*  along with Democrats in Congress in 2019. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=712.66s)]
*  So I go back to what I said before. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=716.0999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is the ultimate con man. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  This is just one big reality show for him. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=722.04s)]
*  He loves the attention. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=725.3599999999999s)]
*  He loves having the media into the Oval Office. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=727.0s)]
*  He loves doing those bogus signings of executive orders, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  many of which aren't even real executive orders. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=733.4799999999999s)]
*  They're essentially press releases. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=735.7199999999999s)]
*  He just loves the show. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=737.64s)]
*  And it's just sad to me. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=740.2399999999999s)]
*  And I have to admit, I'll never quite understand it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=741.52s)]
*  How many people have actually been suffered by him [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  and believe his tremendous amount of BS. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=747.6s)]
*  And on that last point, getting suckered by the BS [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=751.48s)]
*  while their Medicaid, while their healthcare is on the line. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  I saw- And while Trump makes billions off it, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  while he makes billions, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=761.24s)]
*  people will be poor as a result of it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=762.72s)]
*  We saw the CBO nonpartisan scoring [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=765.12s)]
*  of what would actually happen with people losing healthcare, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=768.76s)]
*  millions of people losing healthcare [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=773.52s)]
*  off of what these mega Republicans are doing. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=776.08s)]
*  Can you speak to the attack on Medicaid though [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=778.12s)]
*  and what that really means for Americans? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=781.12s)]
*  I know mega Republicans were talking about shifting [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=783.7800000000001s)]
*  all of the kind of Medicaid cost share to states, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=787.0s)]
*  which would basically in many states that have trigger laws [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=790.0s)]
*  mean no Medicaid at all, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=792.6s)]
*  or even if they didn't have trigger laws, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=793.96s)]
*  they're not able to fund it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=795.76s)]
*  So what's going on there? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=796.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so first the House passed, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=798.0400000000001s)]
*  the House Republicans passed the bill. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  Their first part of reconciliation [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=803.0400000000001s)]
*  we talked about earlier, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=805.6s)]
*  $880 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=807.0s)]
*  by far the biggest in American history. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=809.96s)]
*  There's some Senate Republicans who wanna chop [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=812.0s)]
*  that figure down to about $500 billion. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=814.16s)]
*  Well, okay, they would still be the biggest Medicaid cuts [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=817.56s)]
*  in American history and still have a devastating impact. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=820.16s)]
*  Now, some of them will attempt to pull the wool [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=823.12s)]
*  over the eyes of the American people and say, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=826.0s)]
*  oh no, they're not taking away Medicaid. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=828.16s)]
*  We're shifting the costs of the states. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=830.8s)]
*  Yeah, you're shifting the costs to states [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  who don't have the money to do it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=834.76s)]
*  Keep in mind that I'll just use my state [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=836.92s)]
*  as an example, Pennsylvania. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=838.88s)]
*  Medicaid represents more money to the state of Pennsylvania [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=840.76s)]
*  than all of the other federal dollars [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=844.72s)]
*  we give Pennsylvania combined. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=846.6s)]
*  And that's pretty representative actually [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=848.8s)]
*  of the way the financing works. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=851.12s)]
*  So the reality is for the 44% of people in my district [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=854.16s)]
*  who are on Medicaid, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=857.6s)]
*  for the other tens of millions of people on Medicaid [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=858.84s)]
*  nationwide, they will lose Medicaid coverage [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=861.4s)]
*  or if they don't lose Medicaid coverage entirely, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  depending on their state, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=867.8s)]
*  they will see a drop in what that coverage actually covers. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  This will have a devastating impact and why? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=873.64s)]
*  In order to help subsidize tax cuts [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=876.72s)]
*  for the top 1% of Americans. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  It's truly immoral, it's bad economics. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=882.56s)]
*  It really shows you that Trump's economic policy [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=886.4s)]
*  is a rich man's war, poor man's fight. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjMggQLOPdU&t=888.96s)]
