# Trump goes OFF THE RAILS in DISASTER SPEECH
**MeidasTouch:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c)
*  Donald Trump just finished up a disastrous speech at the Nippon Steel Factory in Pittsburgh, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is trying to take credit for a deal whereby Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=6.8s)]
*  will be acquiring U.S. steel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=12.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is making up fake terms of the agreement when, in fact, the agreement was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=15.44s)]
*  already made in 2023 and was blocked by former President Biden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=21.04s)]
*  And Donald Trump on the campaign trail threatened to block this deal as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=24.96s)]
*  But now he's just making up fake terms about what the deal actually is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=29.52s)]
*  I'll talk about that in a little bit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=33.04s)]
*  But here's what Donald Trump says while speaking with the steel workers at Nippon Steel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=35.04s)]
*  He says that we will be increasing steel tariffs from 25 percent and doubling it to 50 percent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=39.92s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  But he's great. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=48.08s)]
*  He's great at what he does. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=48.96s)]
*  We are going to be imposing a 25 percent increase. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=51.04s)]
*  We're going to bring it from 25 percent to 50 percent, the tariffs on steel into the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=56.72s)]
*  United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=62.08s)]
*  Nobody's going to get around that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=72.08s)]
*  So we're bringing it up from 25 percent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=74.64s)]
*  We're doubling it to 50 percent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=78.8s)]
*  And that's a loophole. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=81.52s)]
*  And by the way, I have to tell you, I believe that this group of people that just made this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=82.96s)]
*  investments right now are very happy because that means that nobody's going to be able to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  steal your industry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=93.28s)]
*  It's at 25 percent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  They can sort of get over that fence at 50 percent. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  They can no longer get over the fence. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=101.28s)]
*  So congratulations to everybody and to you for making a great deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  You just made a better deal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=108.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=110.32s)]
*  I said to the group, would you rather have a 40 percent increase? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  Because I was thinking about 40 when I came. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=117.36s)]
*  I said, would you rather have a 40 percent or a 50 percent? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=120.32s)]
*  They said, we'll take 50. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  I said, I had I had a feeling you were going to say that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=125.6s)]
*  Now, by doing that, he's going to actually cause America to lose a lot of jobs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=128.48s)]
*  A lot of our manufacturers rely on steel imports from other countries as part of their [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  kind of processes to build other things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  And so by Donald Trump imposing that tariff, it will be a significant net loss on our economy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=143.76s)]
*  of the 28 economists who were surveyed about whether this is a good idea to tariff steel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=149.44s)]
*  50 percent all 28 say it's either very unfavorable or unfavorable to the United States economy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=156.0s)]
*  Next up, Donald Trump then says that we're going to have close to 11 trillion dollars [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  invested in the United States. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=167.04s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Those numbers are going through the roof. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=170.48s)]
*  We're going to have close to 11 trillion dollars invested in new investments in the United States. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=172.72s)]
*  You can look at other years. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=179.6s)]
*  There's never been anything like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, that's essentially in two months, not four months, because it took me [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  a little time to get acclimated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=187.76s)]
*  But over the last two, two and a half months, we're over 11 trillion dollars is going to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=190.32s)]
*  becoming Apple. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Again, this is a totally made up number. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  The entire GDP for the United States is somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 trillion dollars. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  This 11 trillion dollars is made up the same way he says when he went to the Middle East [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=206.96s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar invested 5.1 trillion, he says, when the entire GDP [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=212.0s)]
*  of Qatar is 200 billion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=221.28s)]
*  It makes up numbers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=223.12s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump further lies to the people and just watch the routine of just these lies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=225.12s)]
*  He lies to the steelworkers here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  He says there's going to be no layoffs, no outsourcing, and everyone here is going to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  get a $5,000 bonus. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=238.0s)]
*  And he's almost like taking credit for it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=240.72s)]
*  And again, we haven't seen the terms of the new deal and we know that this is going to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=243.12s)]
*  lead to jobs being lost, but he'll just blame it on other people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=247.52s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=250.56s)]
*  You're not going to have to even think about that, frankly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=251.44s)]
*  It won't matter because they're going to be here for a long time, a lot longer than that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=255.12s)]
*  There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=258.96s)]
*  And every US steelworker will soon receive a well-deserved $5,000 bonus. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=262.88s)]
*  That's very nice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=269.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=272.32s)]
*  That's great. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=274.72s)]
*  That's important. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=276.32s)]
*  For what you've gone through, you've gone through a lot. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=277.84s)]
*  It's closing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=280.08s)]
*  It's not closing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=280.8s)]
*  It's opening. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=281.76s)]
*  And you want to stay here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=282.32s)]
*  People say, well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  So we'll do something like chips. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=286.56s)]
*  Somehow you don't want to do chips. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=288.24s)]
*  I'm looking at these giant guys with the giant arms. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=289.6s)]
*  You're not going to like doing chips. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=292.56s)]
*  Most importantly, more lying from Donald Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=295.12s)]
*  He then stands in front of these steelworkers and says that the 2024 election was the greatest [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=298.0s)]
*  landslide ever. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=303.6s)]
*  He says it's the biggest landslide in 129 years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  It's false. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=308.32s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't even get the majority of the vote in the 2024 election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=308.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=313.12s)]
*  I said before and I'll say it again, we have the hottest country right now in just four months. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=314.56s)]
*  But actually, you have to go back to November 5th. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Since November 5th, that was election day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=324.0s)]
*  We had the greatest election victory, they say, in 129 years. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=326.32s)]
*  The most consequential election in 129 years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=330.56s)]
*  I don't know what 129 years was, but we'll see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=334.96s)]
*  We'll check it out later on. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=337.92s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Must have been something pretty good. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=340.48s)]
*  But we have the most consequential. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=342.0s)]
*  We won every swing state. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  We won the popular vote. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=346.24s)]
*  We won the districts, 2,750 to 505. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=348.16s)]
*  We're doing a job and you're doing- [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you see, though, it's just lie after lie after lie to the people who are there, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=355.92s)]
*  to the steelworkers who are there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=361.44s)]
*  You know, when he's called out on the lie, he'll blame judges, he'll blame the Japanese company, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=363.36s)]
*  he'll blame Congress, but I didn't do it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=370.16s)]
*  But it's obvious, this is all just one gigantic fraud. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=373.04s)]
*  Like this, Donald Trump says that last month, we cut the trade deficit in half. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=376.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Last month, we also cut the trade deficit in half. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=382.96s)]
*  That's the story of today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=386.72s)]
*  They can't believe it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=388.56s)]
*  The numbers just came. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=389.44s)]
*  We cut, before we even get started, actually, we cut it in half. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=390.48s)]
*  And again, just a basic fact check. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=395.12s)]
*  We did not cut the deficit in half. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=397.04s)]
*  Why don't I even just use Elon Musk's grock, his AI, to fact check this? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  And you'll see, no, Donald Trump's claim that the US cut the trade deficit in half last month [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=404.32s)]
*  is not true. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=408.72s)]
*  According to the latest data, the US trade deficit actually increased [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=409.68s)]

*  So the deficit is going up and it's not going down. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  All of Donald Trump's things have had the reverse effect. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=426.96s)]
*  I get asked a lot where I do my research from for things like that as well, and for seeing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=430.4s)]
*  how this stuff is being covered by right-wing and by left-wing media. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=436.32s)]
*  I use something called ground news. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  So I took a look at ground news just to see who's covering this fake terms that Donald [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=441.36s)]
*  Trump's pushing out there for this US steel deal with Nippon. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=448.88s)]
*  As I look at the results here, you see that 49% of the sources are allegedly on the quote, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=454.56s)]
*  unquote, center, which is deeply problematic because they are getting fed headlines. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  US steel to remain in America form partnership with Nippon, Trump says. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=465.6s)]

*  We're going to follow it very closely. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=732.72s)]
*  So let's just take a look at what the United States Steelworkers Union is saying. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  Just because I think facts matter, their headline is US Steel Partnership Announcements. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=739.2s)]
*  More question than answers. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=744.96s)]
*  They haven't seen the union hasn't seen the terms of this deal. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=746.88s)]
*  I think it's an important thing to point out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=750.48s)]
*  The union hasn't seen the terms of the deal. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=751.92s)]
*  They said if it's the 2023 deal, and that means Nippon, the Japanese company, is acquiring US [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  Steel, not the opposite way. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=760.24s)]
*  But Donald Trump and his regime members were out there saying, no, no, no, Nippon's deal is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=762.48s)]
*  going to be folded under US Steel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=768.4s)]
*  And it's like US Steel acquiring Nippon. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=770.88s)]
*  That's not what's happening. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=773.28s)]
*  Nippon is acquiring US Steel. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=774.32s)]
*  And one of the things that we've seen with these types of acquisitions is going to be [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=776.88s)]
*  layoffs and then a movement towards non-union shop factories. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=781.2s)]
*  That's what they're going to do. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=786.0s)]
*  And then when they do it, Trump's going to say, oh, but I had it all planned out. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  It was all perfect. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=792.08s)]
*  But then the radical left just did this to me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=792.96s)]
*  How do the people not in that audience not know that the guy is conning him? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=796.48s)]
*  Don't you realize this is the scheme he ran in Atlantic City in the early 1990s, and they all [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=801.44s)]
*  lost their jobs? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=807.12s)]
*  Don't you have a short memory of what happened the last time around with him? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  They don't. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=811.84s)]
*  They don't. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=812.32s)]
*  I don't know how else to get through. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=812.72s)]
*  And then the guy's defrauding you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=816.32s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=818.08s)]
*  I'll check back in with you in three months. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKLwvqj16c&t=819.2800000000001s)]
