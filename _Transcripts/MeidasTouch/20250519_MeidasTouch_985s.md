# FURIOUS Poland DESTROYS Trump in SURPRISE ELECTION
**MeidasTouch:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w)
*  Go shop! Go shop! Go shop! Go shop! Go shop! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=0.0s)]
*  That was in Poland right there. Poland sending a major pro-democracy, pro-European Union message as well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=5.16s)]
*  Earlier yesterday, there was the Romania elections where the pro-democracy, pro-EU candidate went on to become the president. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=14.36s)]
*  This was the first round voting in Poland. The next round scheduled for June 1. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And the pro-democracy liberal Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzawski is going to go on to win that first round against the far right-wing candidate, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=28.4s)]
*  Nierwocki, who many people expected the far right-wing rival, who's a MAGA candidate, who sucks up to Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  He calls himself like the Trump of Poland. People thought Karola Nierwocki was going to win. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=48.28s)]
*  Now we go to this second round on June 1. We're going to, of course, be paying a lot of attention to that here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=55.64s)]
*  Let me just share with you what Karol Nierwocki had campaigned on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=64.08s)]
*  You'll see he, you know, just constantly talking about Trump this, Trump that. I'm the MAGA candidate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  So here was a speech that he gave here playing this clip. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=77.48s)]
*  And the most powerful man in the free world, Donald Trump, is supporting Karol Nierwocki. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=80.64s)]
*  And again, this was an obvious repudiation of the Trump MAGA candidate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=89.04s)]
*  And again, we reported yesterday how in Romania, the far right-wing candidate Simeon was expected to go on and win originally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=108.84s)]
*  The odds were that the right-wing candidate was going to win. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  You then had the centrist candidate who was the mayor of Bucharest went on to win in Romania. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  We did a whole video on that as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=131.72s)]
*  One of the things that I think was very important in this Polish election was Mayor Rafał Trzawski ran on a strong pro-Ukraine platform, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=135.4s)]
*  anti-Putin platform, as well as building the military forces up in Poland, creating a first-class military to stop Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  I want to share with you, I thought this was an important moment, because the views of Rafał Trzawski mirror the Prime Minister Donald Tusk. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=159.28s)]
*  I'll explain how the Poland government works. A very confused prime minister, president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  But here was Donald Tusk recently. Let's play this clip. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=178.28s)]
*  I mean, here he is talking about standing up to Putin. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=184.16s)]
*  And when Putin didn't show in Istanbul, Turkey, I think it was a big sign that impacted this election as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=188.48s)]
*  Remember how I reported on how Putin and Trump said they were going to go to Istanbul to negotiate with Zelensky. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=195.92s)]
*  Zelensky showed up in Istanbul, but Putin and Trump didn't. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=205.12s)]
*  Here, let's play this clip of Donald Tusk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=207.92s)]
*  We met again after a few days in the same format with President Zelensky. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  We spoke on the phone with President Trump to summarize the negotiation attempts that started in Istanbul. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  The information was clear. The Russian side did not show goodwill. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=226.04s)]
*  The Russian side did not intend to negotiate in the presence of the American side. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  The Russian side once again set conditions that were absolutely unacceptable, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=236.6s)]
*  not only to Ukraine, but also to all of us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=240.4s)]
*  We will continue to work together. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=243.28s)]
*  The main task is to maintain full unity, both of European and American partners around the Ukrainian issue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=246.0s)]
*  This task remains current. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=252.56s)]
*  We do not hide that the Russian position is hard to call it constructive in any way. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=254.24s)]
*  We are likely facing very difficult days ahead. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=261.12s)]
*  So in Poland's parliamentary system, they have a prime minister who's the head of government. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=264.72s)]
*  And a president who is the head of state. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=270.28s)]
*  I would say the prime minister has more day-to-day power. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  The president as head of state kind of functions as a veto power over the prime minister. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=276.44s)]
*  So currently, the prime minister Donald Tusk, very similar political background, I would say, to Rafael Trzawski. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  And then when it comes to this MAGA candidate right here who did not win this round, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=291.0s)]
*  although let's be clear, there's a second round. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=296.84s)]
*  Carol Narraki. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=299.48s)]
*  I think his views mostly align, I guess, more closely with Duda, who's the current president. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Although Narraki, the guy who's running right now, is independent, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  but the party of the current president, Duda, is supporting, is aligning with this far-right candidate, Narraki right here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  I want to show you this as well, just to show you [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  the positions of the current government in Poland that I think, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=326.92s)]
*  especially with the threats being posed by Donald Trump, I think it's very effective. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  Here we have Poland's foreign minister, Sikorski. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=336.04s)]
*  You probably have seen some other speeches I've played of foreign minister Sikorski before. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=340.04s)]
*  But here he is about two or three weeks ago talking about how, look, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=345.32s)]
*  if Ukraine stops fighting, there's no more Ukraine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=351.64s)]
*  If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=355.56s)]
*  And that's what we have to remember. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=358.52s)]
*  And he said, we need to prevail on the rest of the world. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=359.88s)]
*  And he said, Donald Trump needs to recognize what's really going on here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=362.92s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=365.96s)]
*  Let us remember that this war ends if Putin stops fighting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=366.92s)]
*  If Ukraine stops fighting, it's the end of Ukraine. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=373.8s)]
*  So what needs to be done is to give Putin reasons to end this catastrophic criminal invasion. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=378.12s)]
*  And we hope that President Trump comes around to our view. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=387.48s)]
*  And about two or three weeks before that, you also had this moment for both the EU and from Poland's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=391.8s)]
*  foreign minister. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=399.64s)]
*  Let's play this other clip. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=400.36s)]
*  We have to put the pressure, the maximum pressure on Russia to really end this war [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=401.96s)]
*  because it takes two to one peace. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=406.92s)]
*  It only takes one to one war. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=408.92s)]
*  And we see that Russia really wants war. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=410.6s)]
*  And all those who want the killing to stop should put the maximum pressure on Russia. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=412.68s)]
*  I just want to say how appalled I am by the latest spate of Russian attacks on Ukraine. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=416.6s)]
*  Ukraine unconditionally agreed to a ceasefire over a month ago. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=423.16s)]
*  The heinous attacks on Krivirykh and on Sumy is Russia's mocking answer. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  I hope that President Trump, the US administration, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=435.24s)]
*  see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=439.8s)]
*  And I hope the right decisions are taken. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  This episode of the Midas Touch podcast is brought to you by Graza. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=446.68s)]
*  And yes, it's my new favorite olive oil. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=449.56s)]
*  It's fresh, never blended and comes from a single type of olive, the Pequal, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  straight out of high-end Spain, where over half the world's olive oil is made. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=456.6s)]
*  So what makes Graza so good? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=460.44s)]
*  First, it's single-origin, which means no mystery blends, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=462.28s)]
*  just pure, flavorful oil you could actually trust. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=465.4s)]
*  And the packaging? Game-changer. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  Squeeze and spray bottles. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=470.52s)]
*  No drippy mess. No fussy tins. Just aim, squeeze, done. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  They've got three types. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=475.96s)]
*  Frizzle, the newest one for high heat frying and grilling. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  Sizzle, your go-to everyday oil for sauteing or roasting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=479.88s)]
*  And drizzle, a bold finishing oil you'll want to put on everything. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, even ice cream. Don't knock it till you try it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=486.76s)]
*  Personally, I love using Graza. It's perfect for when I'm roasting veggies. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=490.04s)]
*  Super clean, super flavorful and way easier than my old olive oil setup. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=493.8s)]
*  I've also been making some amazing salad dressings with the drizzle oil. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=498.12s)]
*  It's so good, so convenient. I don't think I could ever go back to anything else. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=501.32s)]
*  So head to graza.co and use code MIDAS to get 10% off of TRIO, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  which includes sizzle, frizzle and drizzle. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=509.24s)]
*  And get to cook in your next chef quality meal. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  That's graza.co and use MIDAS. M-E-I-D-A-S. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=514.52s)]
*  So if you think about the kind of right-wing MAGA crew, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=519.08s)]
*  Whether it was Maple MAGA lost in Canada, you had Timu Trump lose in Australia, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  Peter Dutton, Pierre Poliev in Canada, Maple MAGA, he lost, he lost his seat, Dutton lost his seat. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=528.84s)]
*  They lost in Romania, as we covered yesterday. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=535.48s)]
*  And now they lost in Poland, first round. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=538.76s)]
*  We're going to go to the second round on June 1st. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=542.12s)]
*  And I think people are now seeing how dangerous this far-right MAGA strain internationally is. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  We're seeing this across the world. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=554.04s)]
*  I want to remind you of this incredible speech that Foreign Minister [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=555.64s)]
*  Sorkowski gave at the United Nations. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=559.24s)]
*  Remember in February or so when Donald Trump had the United States side with Russia and North Korea [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=561.72s)]
*  and Iran against a resolution condemning Russia for its unlawful invasion of Ukraine, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  not even abstain, the United States voted with Russia. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=578.6s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=582.12s)]
*  Then you had Foreign Minister Sorkowski gave this passion speech in the United Nations. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=583.16s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=588.52s)]
*  Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I had many ideas for today's speech, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  but one by one I discarded them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=597.0s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=599.4s)]
*  We live in turbulent times. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  After a short break from history that some of us enjoyed, it has again caught up with us all. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=603.8s)]
*  In times like these, when the world seems out of joint, when the old seems to be dying, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=611.56s)]
*  but the new cannot yet be born, what we need is a return to basics. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=619.24s)]
*  Two questions about what's right and what's wrong, what's true and what's false, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=625.88s)]
*  what's actually happened and what's just a figment of propaganda. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  Almost exactly three years ago, on March 2, 2022, nations of the world gathered here [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=637.4s)]
*  in a special session faced with a straight question, whether to condemn, applaud or ignore [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=653.48s)]
*  Their answer was clear. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=656.9200000000001s)]
*  The measure condemning Vladimir Putin's actions was adopted by a vote of 141 in favor, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=659.32s)]
*  with 35 abstentions and unequivocal reaffirmation of our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  independence, unity and territorial integrity. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=675.72s)]
*  Only five countries voted against, among them Russia, Belarus, North Korea [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=679.88s)]
*  and representatives of the now deposed Syrian regime. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=689.0s)]
*  Here he is again, let's play it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=693.4s)]
*  Opinions in this body began to shift not because facts have changed. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=695.08s)]
*  They are changing because of self-interests. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=701.0s)]
*  Some of our member states now seem to believe that ending the war at any cost [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=703.64s)]
*  and restoring business as usual with Russia will be beneficial. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  As a representative of the country neighboring both Russia and Ukraine, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=716.52s)]
*  I can tell you it will not. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=722.1199999999999s)]
*  By normalizing relations with Moscow, you would be entrusting your security and economic stability [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=725.0s)]
*  to an autocrat and a war criminal in an international environment much more unstable [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=731.48s)]
*  than it was a decade ago. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=737.48s)]
*  Russian victory, may it never come, would not create a more just global order. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=740.28s)]
*  It wouldn't benefit countries dissatisfied with where things stand now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=747.4s)]
*  It wouldn't even bring about a more just and prosperous Russia. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=753.88s)]
*  Suffice to say, there are now more political prisoners in Russia than there were in the 1980s [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=758.12s)]
*  when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=764.5999999999999s)]
*  There are many more casualties as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=767.88s)]
*  And here he is again, let's play this other clip. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=770.36s)]
*  We've just heard another performance by the Russian ambassador consisting of lies, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=772.36s)]
*  propaganda and hypocrisy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=778.4399999999999s)]
*  He referred to Ukraine as a pro-Soviet country. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=780.8399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is not a project. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is a country with a longer history than Russia. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=788.36s)]
*  Ukraine is a member of this body for far longer than the Russian Federation. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine has a history, language and identity and aspirations all of its own, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  with borders, confirmed status, and a strong political power. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=807.8800000000001s)]
*  With borders confirmed several times in treaties by the Russian Federation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=812.36s)]
*  The mission of this body from its foundation has been to decolonize, not to recolonize. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=819.24s)]
*  International community cannot appease aggression because violence reproduces by indifference. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=829.88s)]
*  Basic facts that prompted our strong unified reaction three years ago have remained unchanged. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  And when the facts don't change, we should stick to our guns. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=846.3599999999999s)]
*  Poland, of course, supports peace, but peace that is stable and with justice for the victim of aggression. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=860.68s)]
*  So there you have it, folks. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, let me play this as well. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=863.56s)]
*  Former President Biden, very popular in Poland, February 2023, he gave this incredible speech. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=865.08s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=872.6800000000001s)]
*  We're seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people across Europe saw for decades. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=873.32s)]
*  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  They must be opposed. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=884.6s)]
*  Autocrats only understand one word. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=889.88s)]
*  No, you will not take my country. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=895.64s)]
*  No, you will not take my freedom. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=899.4000000000001s)]
*  No, you will not take my future. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=900.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'll repeat tonight what I said last year in the same place. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=903.24s)]
*  A dictator, better not rebuild an empire, will never be able to ease the people's love of liberty. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=907.48s)]
*  Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=915.96s)]
*  And Ukraine, Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, never. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=920.3599999999999s)]
*  That speech was in Warsaw, and now you know the Warsaw mayor is currently [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=929.88s)]
*  running for the presidency. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  And you saw right there that he did win the first round, Mayor Rafał Zyrowski. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=941.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  So where do we go from here? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=947.4s)]
*  June 1st is the second round. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=949.0799999999999s)]
*  It'll just be a runoff now between Rafał Zyrowski and Carolyn Araki. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=951.24s)]
*  We'll be following it every step of the way here. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=957.8s)]
*  But I want you to be able to make these connections internationally about what's happening. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  But hit subscribe. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=965.0s)]
*  Let's get to 5 million subscribers. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjjCsNqKo_w&t=965.88s)]
