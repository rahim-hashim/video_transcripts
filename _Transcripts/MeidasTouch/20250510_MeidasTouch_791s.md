# Trump UK Deal INSTANTLY BACKFIRES as US Auto REVOLTS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE)
*  Donald Trump's so-called trade deal with the United Kingdom is backfiring in his face [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=0.0s)]
*  It was kind of a fake deal to begin with it's not actually a free trade agreement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  But what it actually dealt with it at a very nuanced level [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  It gave prepper a kid you not it gave preferential treatment to like Rolls Royces and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=18.26s)]
*  Range Rovers and the Land Rovers which would get a 10% baseline tariff [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=26.12s)]
*  while here in the United States of America the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=32.72s)]
*  American automakers are still going to be subject to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=37.66s)]
*  25% tariffs which is then [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=42.56s)]
*  Extra harming them with everything that's going on with Canada and everything that's going on in Mexico [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=45.6s)]
*  So now the big three automakers are looking at this again [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=51.64s)]
*  It was it was a small deal to begin with in the UK right Trump's the arsonist [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=55.24s)]
*  He lit the world on fire with these disastrous trade deals as it relates to UK [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=60.08s)]
*  You know, he took his what 25 percent tariffs on this subset of products [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=64.56s)]
*  Which is like Rolls Royces, you know and a few others and made that 10% [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=70.2s)]
*  And so so here's what they're saying in Detroit right now in Michigan Detroit three automakers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=74.2s)]
*  Blast Trump's UK trade deal. It's a disaster a group representing General Motors Ford and Stellantis [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Blast the Trump's trade deal announced with the United Kingdom saying it would harm the US auto sector [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  British car makers they get the 10% tariff rate compared to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=91.56s)]
*  25% tariff rate that American automakers are getting if they have factories in Mexico and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=96.84s)]
*  Canada under this deal it will now be cheaper to import a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=102.72s)]
*  UK vehicle with very little US content than the United States Mexico Canada agreement [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=107.32s)]
*  Compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=114.48s)]
*  American parts and folks it's not just [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=119.2s)]
*  You know that deal, you know right now. I mean the trade wars as well. It is pissing off rural voters [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=122.8s)]
*  I mean we're seeing right now that Trump is the shock poll that just came out a core part of Trump's base is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=129.48s)]
*  Abandoning him rural voters are rapidly souring on Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=136.8s)]
*  Thanks in large part because he's taking the economy and the new PBS NPR [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=140.48s)]
*  Marist poll [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=146.12s)]
*  Taken just in the past week or so it found only 40% of rural voters approve of Trump's job performance down from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=147.8s)]
*  59 percent in February and 19 percent drop and let's leave no doubt [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=155.88s)]
*  At least as it relates to the the deal with UK who is responsible for the part with the Rolls Royces and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=162.2s)]
*  You know and the Land Rovers is Trump because he's a rich guy and he's doing things with rich people [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=169.72s)]
*  He's doing rich people stuff [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=174.7s)]
*  So this is from Jeff Stein at the Washington Post Trump says he personally [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  intervened in the UK US trade talks to take tariffs from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=180.44s)]
*  25 to 10 on Rolls Royce Jaguars and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=185.0s)]
*  Bentley's and by the way here they are on tape saying it let's play it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=189.4s)]
*  But the president and by the way, I want to make this clear while Jameson and I worked hard [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=193.64s)]
*  This was the president's deal and people think oh, that's not the way it works [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=197.84s)]
*  If you got to sit next to him [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  I have the best deal maker to my left and if you don't think that we take advantage of him calling the prime minister [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=203.16s)]
*  Getting that deal done. You don't understand who's the president United States? So he's the closer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=210.48s)]
*  He gets deals done that we could never get done because he understands business he understands deals [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=216.16s)]
*  Here today so [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=223.96s)]
*  There are some who call him Howard Lutnick. There are others who call him Howard nutlick [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=226.56s)]
*  I'm not gonna say who calls him who but I've just I've heard that rumor [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=231.38s)]
*  Let's bring in lieutenant governor Garland Gilchrist [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Michigan you're running for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=239.36s)]
*  governor [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Entrepreneur engineer yourself [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  This is impacting Michigan, you know [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Detroit is pissed at all of us. Let's start with this and let's move on but but tell us about this UK deal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  It is yet another step in the bad direction that Donald Trump has taken America and taken Michigan manufacturing and Michigan [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=256.14s)]
*  Manufacturing workers. I mean look [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=264.56s)]
*  I don't know what Donald Trump's goals are other than the selfish ones to I guess get more Rolls Royces that he can somehow [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=267.0s)]
*  drive and fit in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=273.8s)]
*  But what I do know is that even if he had a goal that was in the interests of the people of Michigan [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=274.96s)]
*  This is not the team I trust to actually be able to get it done [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=279.68s)]
*  They're so incompetent that they would make a deal that they claim should be to help American manufacturing that literally hurts Michigan [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=282.48s)]
*  Manufacturers and when it hurts those companies, but it really hurts the people who work at those companies [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=289.64s)]
*  So I just it's yet another abject failure on our behalf and frankly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  This is why we have to do everything we can to push back against this man and all his allies [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=299.58s)]
*  Look as part of your gubernatorial race you travel in the state [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=303.76s)]
*  But even setting that aside as lieutenant governor you travel the state you roll your sleeves up, you know the state [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=306.96s)]
*  Well, you know the counties the cities the towns [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=312.56s)]
*  Michigan voted [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=315.96s)]
*  For Trump in 2024 they they they picked this guy not everybody but they they picked him [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=317.96s)]
*  What do you know why and what now? What what are you seeing now? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  You know the why is you know, like someone in the pet but what do you see now? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=330.44s)]
*  Are you seeing shifts there are there changes is it hyperbolic when people say all these people are late? What do you see? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, look, I've been all 83 counties in Michigan. You're right [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  We got two peninsulas 83 counties have been that all of them three or more times over these last several years [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=344.78s)]
*  And so I get it and what I also get is our people are frustrated with they want to see results [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=350.2s)]
*  They want to see more progress they want to see things happen for them in their communities and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=356.76s)]
*  Franklin people are frustrated with the results or progress. They haven't seen it fast enough [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  They're more open to being lied to by somebody like Trump or Charleston who makes things up [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=366.44s)]
*  Who just promises he's like the little kid who ran for you know class president in seventh grade and promised everybody ice cream every [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=371.08s)]
*  Day and pizza every Friday and stuff like that. Like that's that that was the campaign that he ran [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=377.92s)]
*  But what we have to do is let people know like now the pain that they're feeling the prices that continue to rise [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=382.36s)]
*  You know the 900 workers at Solantis at the Chrysler plant that got laid off when the tariffs were first [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=388.36s)]
*  Announced a couple months ago [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=394.16s)]
*  like these people are actually damaged by the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=396.16s)]
*  Decisions the choices that this president is making and he's failing on their behalf and it's hurting them including the woman who I talked to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=398.36s)]
*  Who's part of those folks who got laid off? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=404.36s)]
*  We just bought a house the month before now how she supposed to pay her mortgage [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  On her second mortgage payments since that layoff occurred [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=409.72s)]
*  And so, you know [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=411.96s)]
*  We have to make sure that that people understand where the pain is coming from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=413.04s)]
*  And let's know that it's coming from Trump his allies to people who are imitating him in Michigan [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=417.16s)]
*  And they're the ones who need to be held accountable and we have to stand up [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=421.6s)]
*  We have to stand tall [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=424.6s)]
*  We have to raise our voice and push back against this stuff and let them know that the best way to protect our communities is not [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=425.6s)]
*  Like this terrible stuff going to impact in the first place [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=430.86s)]
*  So that's why I'm proud of people of Michigan stand it up all across the state of Michigan [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  I was just in our 10th congressional district a couple days ago [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  That's a district that's represented by John James [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=440.76s)]
*  Should I say not represented because he hasn't had a town hall [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=443.6s)]
*  He hasn't heard from those auto workers in his district [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=445.88s)]
*  We're being hurt by these tears or the families or the veterans or the Medicaid people get their care from Medicaid [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  So I had held a Medicaid rally to say, you know [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=454.8s)]
*  We are here to support the people who may lose their health care because of the budget framework that he's gonna vote for as a congressman [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=457.56s)]
*  Really in lock, stock and barrel in line with Donald Trump [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=463.56s)]
*  So that's the energy that I'm seeing is people really standing up strong thousands of people taking action and our leaders need to respond [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=465.84s)]
*  You know, I think about this the Michigan GOP party use the word [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  imitate Donald Trump because [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  What it seems that they do the Michigan GOP is just like a clone image of him [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  But they don't they're kind of like an SNL skit version of him [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=485.8s)]
*  Like an even worse and weirder version of him so you have like the speaker of the house in Michigan [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  You know who will start calling you're a low IQ individual will say to like a member of the state house [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  you know and like you think they're trying to use the Trump like language and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  It and don't get me wrong. It's horrible and puke inducing when Trump does it but but that GOP Michigan party [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't even know what other than to like listen to Trump's posts and then go okay Alcatraz [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=513.0s)]
*  We're tariffing movies today [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=518.7199999999999s)]
*  What else? Oh, we don't like libraries get rid of people's Medicaid. Like what are they even do? What are they doing? What are they? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, I don't think people want imitators [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=530.56s)]
*  You know [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=532.64s)]
*  I think people want people with heart and backbone and vision and that is frankly not what I see [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=533.28s)]
*  From the Republican Party period whether it's in Michigan America. I don't see vision from this president. I see failure [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=538.16s)]
*  But look, I think about things in a way to how can we actually listen to people and understand what's important to them? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=543.52s)]
*  And then work with them to find a solution or build a solution to the challenges that they face [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=548.8s)]
*  So, you know people are still struggling with affordable housing all across America [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=552.64s)]
*  We are millions of housing units short all across this country [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=558.52s)]
*  Well in Michigan when I heard about that issue because of my business to all the communities [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=561.04s)]
*  I actually put in place funding that helped get 60,000 housing units online in just over three years [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=565.1199999999999s)]
*  We've never built homes that quickly build apartments that quickly in the state of Michigan [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=570.5999999999999s)]
*  And now that's gonna help us stabilize prices and ultimately bring them down so more people can afford a home [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=575.32s)]
*  Someplace in the state of Michigan [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=581.0s)]
*  I hear people being worried about health care and especially with these cuts to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=582.6s)]
*  Medicaid that are gonna be on the table from this Congress [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=586.32s)]
*  I don't trust them for one second that Medicaid is off the table [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=588.7800000000001s)]
*  What I know is that the families who are struggling to get mental and behavioral health support for adults and children in their lives [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I work to create something called the certified community behavioral health plan program in Michigan [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=597.7800000000001s)]
*  Alongside retired Senator Debbie Sabanow now our providers can serve 40% more patients [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=602.76s)]
*  They can serve more people do school-based health centers like actually bringing care to people so that they can deal with the anxiety [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  That's being induced by distress inducing anxiety inducing damage inducing precedent [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=614.68s)]
*  And so we have infrastructure to put in place in the build and to grow but that's the kind of problem-solving energy that I think people [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=619.16s)]
*  Want from their from their leaders and I think you know if you want a problem solver and I'm running for governor as an engineer [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=625.04s)]
*  Who is trained to solve problems trained to make systems work for people not just break systems the way these people do [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=630.32s)]
*  Just maybe you know, I'm sure some of our viewers know about you, but before we go, you know one [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=637.08s)]
*  Where could they find out more about you? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  But to just you know tell us a little bit about yourself though for our listeners and viewers who may not be from Michigan [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I certainly want people to check me out at Garland Gilchrist calm. That's G a R L I N [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=651.6400000000001s)]
*  G I L C H R I [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=658.12s)]
*  ST calm and like I said, look, I'm a husband. I'm a father of three. I live in the city of Detroit [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=659.88s)]
*  My twins are born on my birthday [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=666.16s)]
*  so I'm the luckiest man alive and then on top of that my baby girl's birthday is Juneteenth and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=667.66s)]
*  I'm a kid who's an engineer because his grandma bought him a computer when he was five years old and I fell in love [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  With technology and I realized that that we are the ones who control it and can make it work for us [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's what led me to be an engineer to make to learn how to understand [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=681.92s)]
*  Solutions to problems and make systems work for people and that's what I've done as an engineer [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  That's what I did when I worked in the private sector at Microsoft when I was a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=690.52s)]
*  Software entrepreneur who started and sold two companies [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=694.6s)]
*  But most importantly though when I was a community organizer working on social economic and racial justice campaigning all across the country [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=696.88s)]
*  doing things like expanding access to health care and expanding Medicaid in the state of Michigan and because of that Medicaid expansion and because of the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=702.72s)]
*  Proposed potential cuts from this Trump administration those 700,000 people who got Medicaid and health insurance now could lose it because this administration's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=710.02s)]
*  Recklessness and lack of care for them and their well-being [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=717.66s)]
*  But I'm running for governor now in Michigan to build on the foundation [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=721.02s)]
*  I've laid alongside Governor Whitmer to say that we've made progress and now we need to take it to the next level [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=723.78s)]
*  We need to accelerate because these times are different this administration is different [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=728.34s)]
*  Technology is different and people are anxious about the future of our economy. Well as a software [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=732.66s)]
*  Developer as someone who understands where technology can do and how it can help people but also the risk that it poses [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=737.82s)]
*  I'm I want to work with them to put the systems in place so that people can say yes to the state of Michigan [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=743.02s)]
*  So they can see this as a place where they can stay here and succeed [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=747.78s)]
*  And for those of you who are not yet in Michigan, you can come here and grow and be successful [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joQp9zd_NaE&t=750.9s)]
