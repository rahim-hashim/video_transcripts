# Trump Witnesses COLLAPSE on LIVE TV from CROSS-EXAM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic)
*  Democratic senators are going gloves off, ripping the Trump witnesses to shreds who are testifying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=0.0s)]
*  before them. Take a look at Democratic Senator Slotkin from Michigan as she looks with disgust [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=8.48s)]
*  at dog killer Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Let's play the clip. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=17.12s)]
*  My concern is you're sending a chill down the spine of America by going after people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=22.0s)]
*  who either have legal status or American citizens. And when my colleagues ask you about habeas corpus [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=27.52s)]
*  and you say literally we can review the tape that you believe it's a right the president has, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=34.32s)]
*  you sat here in front of all of us and swore an oath to the constitution and that is not at all [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=40.32s)]
*  what habeas corpus is. It is a right that we all get, that American citizens get, that people who [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  are in the United States legally have. So my concern is it's complete overreach. I don't [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=52.0s)]
*  think American citizens, even those who voted for Trump, believe that you should be able to just grab [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=58.56s)]
*  someone off the street, sloppy, who has the legal right to be here and certainly an American citizen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=63.04s)]
*  And I just am concerned that while you say you're going after the most dangerous folks, what you're [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=68.48s)]
*  actually doing is going after folks for political reasons, right? A PhD student that's on our [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=75.28s)]
*  absolutely not doing that and we're not deporting US citizens and we're not deporting people who [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=81.92s)]
*  have legal status here. Ten American citizens have been deported. And we're now also learning about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=86.48s)]
*  the Trump regime sending a Burmese national to South Sudan in violation of a federal judge's order. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=93.04s)]
*  We'll be covering that more in depth as well. A massive violation of a court order there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=102.4s)]
*  Then you have Democratic Senator Dick Durbin schooling RFK Jr. in some basic facts. And RFK [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=108.4s)]
*  Jr. is forced to admit, oh, I guess I'm just learning this now. Play this clip. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  But I want to remind you, on April 1st, 10 laboratory heads at National Institute of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=121.92s)]
*  Neurological Disorders and Strokes received their layoff notices. They were all PhDs and senior [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=126.56s)]
*  investigators. They're not administrators, whatever that might be. They were running [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=132.88s)]
*  intramural labs at NIH. If you have your way, they'll all be gone on June 2nd. Science Magazine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=137.6s)]
*  reported 25 of 320 physician researchers at NIH's Internal Clinical Center are leaving. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=144.64s)]
*  And the number of patients treated in the hospital has been reduced by 30%. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=151.68s)]
*  Three grants involving ALS and dementia work at Northwestern University in Illinois have been [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=156.32s)]
*  paused. One looking at how to stop the buildup of damaged proteins and other looking at cellular [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=162.72s)]
*  mechanisms that can be drug targets. Just last week, an ALS researcher at Harvard had his grant [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=167.68s)]
*  cut that was using AI to accelerate the reversal of ALS symptoms. Brian Wallach is waiting for a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=174.32s)]
*  cure. He is not giving up. His source of hope is this research that you are unfortunately terminating. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=181.68s)]
*  How can we possibly address his concerns and give hope to people across the country who are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=189.12s)]
*  suffering from so many diseases when our government is cutting back on that research? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=194.24s)]
*  As I said, Senator, I do not know about any cuts to ALS research and I'm happy to meet with you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=199.76s)]
*  I just read them to you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=207.12s)]
*  I will have to go and talk with Jay Bhattacharya and find out what the rationale was for those cuts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=208.96s)]
*  I just don't know about them until you told me about them at this moment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  There are many things that concern both of us about the state of public health in America. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Next up, you have Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. Here's her line of questioning [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  where she talks about how all this Trump crap is a bunch of political theater and not progress. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=230.88s)]
*  Beautiful line of questioning right here. Play this clip. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  I have some questions. The questions are going to be, is it political theater or progress? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  You ready? The first question is going to be, doing an executive order revoking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=250.56s)]
*  birthright citizenship, political theater or progress? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=257.36s)]
*  Political theater. It doesn't help the mission of ICE. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=261.28s)]
*  Okay. How about revoking student visas? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  It takes up the time of ICE officers and is political theater and it takes away from the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=268.48s)]
*  national security and public safety mission. How about bashing car windows of people with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=272.08s)]
*  no criminal record? That's driven from quotas of arrests being driven by the White House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  That is politicization of ICE immigration enforcement, so it's political theater. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=283.76s)]
*  How about deporting people who are even citizens? That's not even deportation, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=288.4s)]
*  but you know what I'm saying. It's political theater and I believe [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=295.28s)]
*  that this White House is getting the outcome, you know, the reaction that they want and they desire. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=298.64s)]
*  How about arresting political opponents? That would be political theater. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=304.56s)]
*  Yeah. So here's the deal. I know that you've been cut off a number of times [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=310.64s)]
*  as you have tried to give answers to various questions. Thank you so much for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=314.88s)]
*  explaining that even this committee hearing is actually a bunch of political theater because [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  there's a lot of things that we could be talking about. We could be talking about the fact that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  we are currently in reconciliation and while everyone else has been told to do things such [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=327.52s)]
*  as make sure that you take food out of people's mouths, make sure that you get rid of people's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=332.56s)]
*  health care, make sure that you are harming our federal workers even more by making sure that the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=336.88s)]
*  resources that they need to be able to do their job just kind of disappear, but at the same time, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=345.2s)]
*  I think the way that Mr. Moskowitz figured it, it would be approximately $44,000 [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=350.08s)]
*  as it relates to a bonus for each ICE agent. Is that correct? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=356.48s)]
*  It's incorrect. It was $42,000. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=360.88s)]
*  Okay. My bad. But the reality is that we do have real problems and I don't know how we're [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=362.56s)]
*  going to get to real solutions if we continue to just make everything about politics as it was [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=369.36s)]
*  properly outlined by the gentleman from Florida. That was a Republican bill and I'll be perfectly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=375.52s)]
*  honest with you. I wasn't really a big fan of the bill myself on my side. So I know that there was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=381.36s)]
*  a lot of conservative stuff in that bill that was going to be harmful and with that, I am going to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=387.04s)]
*  yield back to the gentleman from Florida. More from Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=391.68s)]
*  Crockett, who brings the fight. Play the clip. Federal law explicitly prohibits DHS from quote, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=396.32s)]
*  preventing a member of Congress from entering for the purpose of conducting oversight, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  house aliens or to make any temporary modification at any such facility that in any way alters what [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=420.32s)]
*  is observed by a visiting member of Congress. It is against the law. Full stop. Separately, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=428.72s)]
*  the court has consistently held that the speech and debate clause of the Constitution protects [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=439.12s)]
*  individual members from prosecution for legislative acts, including quote, fact finding, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=444.72s)]
*  field investigations and information gathering. The court has consistently held that the primary [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  purpose of the speech and debate clause is to quote, prevent intimidation by the executive [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=458.56s)]
*  and before a possibly hostile judiciary. So let's call this for what it is. This administration is [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=465.12s)]
*  criminalizing legislative oversight and the Republicans on this committee are helping them [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=473.04s)]
*  to do so. Rep. McIver didn't engage in interference. It was ICE that engaged in interference while [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=478.32s)]
*  members of Congress attempted to conduct a legitimate oversight of ICE facilities. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=485.12s)]
*  Now we've got Democratic Congress member Jamie Raskin who's fired up. He's pissed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=490.08s)]
*  You've got the Trump regime giving the family of Ashley Babbitt five million dollars from taxpayer [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=495.68s)]
*  money. She was an insurrectionist who would not listen to the cops when she tried to break into [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=503.2s)]
*  the secured area and she and a group of other insurrectionists threatened the lives of Republican, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=509.28s)]
*  Democrat, independent members of Congress. Watch Raskin go in, play the clip. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=517.52s)]
*  More from Democratic Congress member Raskin here. Let's play it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=539.28s)]
*  He's proposed no money payments to the bereaved family of officer Brian Sicknick, an Army veteran [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=569.28s)]
*  with two tours abroad who died at age 42 here on January 7th, 2021, the very next day after being [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=592.96s)]
*  brutalized by rioters. The decision to give millions of dollars to the Babbitt family and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=602.08s)]
*  nothing to the families of the police officers who defended this Capitol, who defended us, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  exacerbates the insult of Speaker Johnson's continuing refusal to hang a simple plaque [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  in honor of the officers who defended the Capitol and the Congress and the Vice President, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=622.64s)]
*  a plaque mandated by law and now more than two years overdue on the West Front of the Capitol. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=627.76s)]
*  The Speaker's stubborn refusal to respect the law is craven submission to the executive branch, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=635.36s)]
*  to Donald Trump, who wants to pretend that the rampaging mob that he sent to Congress was made [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  up of patriotic heroes and that the people he pardoned were quote hostages. More from Raskin. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=648.96s)]
*  Let's play it. Now we've got colleagues who celebrate January 6th insurrectionists actually [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  calling for prosecution of members of the House for doing their jobs. Representative Buddy Carter [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=661.52s)]
*  called our colleagues rioters. Representative Bishop actually said this was an insurrection. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=667.52s)]
*  I didn't know that was in his vocabulary, but this was an insurrection and he said it was a [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=674.48s)]
*  debacle worse than 9-11. Next up, we've got Democratic Congress member Jared Moskowitz, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=678.8s)]
*  who points out the amount of waste in the MAGA Republican budget where they want to give $800 [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=684.8s)]
*  million in bonuses to ICE agents, $42,000 per ICE agent. And Moskowitz is like, I'm okay, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=691.76s)]
*  give them a bonus. But like, does that $42,000 per ICE agent? What about all the FEMA people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=700.96s)]
*  we're cutting and the NIH people and CDC who were firing and the veterans who were firing? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=708.72s)]
*  Here, play this clip. Mr. Munoz, on that topic of bonuses, just real quick, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  do you support ICE agents getting $42,000 worth of bonuses? There's $800 billion for bonuses. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay. I say billion. I'm sorry, million. I apologize. $800 million in there for bonuses. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you support that? Yeah. What kind of bonuses are we talking about? Are we talking retention [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  bonuses? This is a great question, Mr. Marino. Great question. They didn't say it at all in the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=737.6s)]
*  backup. There was no documentation at all what the bonuses were for or what it would be. It was just [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=743.44s)]
*  $800 million for bonuses. It sounded like a lot of money for federal employees for bonuses, not that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  we don't want to treat our federal employees. Great. Of course we do. But I had suggested $500 [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=754.32s)]
*  million for bonuses and they said, no, $500 million sounds a little better, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, look. Or zero. Are you at zero for bonuses, maybe? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  I never received a $42,000 bonus. Good. Perfect. We agree. I would like to. However, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=767.7600000000001s)]
*  times are different. Recruiting is tougher. Retention is a challenge. And if that's something [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  that it's needed for, I would support- So do you support those bonuses for NOAA, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=780.32s)]
*  FEMA, the Pentagon, all of the departments or just ICE? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=784.72s)]
*  I would support strategic use of retention bonuses where they were needed. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=787.84s)]
*  I think what's going on there, because as you heard, it's not even described what this money is [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=792.96s)]
*  for. I think it's a slush fund to buy more ads on, as in my opinion, to buy more ads on Fox [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=798.08s)]
*  and to spread more kind of Trump propaganda, as I think what that's going to be used for. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=804.96s)]
*  And I think they're using the idea of ICE agents as like a sympathetic [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=810.0s)]
*  figure while the money's actually going to go to Trump propaganda. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=817.36s)]

*  questioning. Let's play the clip. You repeatedly claim that staffing and funding cuts that have [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=932.9599999999999s)]
*  been reported on publicly and even confirmed by your department staff are not happening. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=937.76s)]

*  Senator, you provided presided here, I think for 32 years, you presided over the destruction [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  of the health of the American people. People are now the sickest people in the world. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=953.84s)]
*  Oh, Democratic Congresswoman Barragan, I thought really destroyed Lee Zeldin, the EPA [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=958.88s)]
*  administrator for Trump. Play this clip. You just mentioned two examples. Have you or EPA [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=967.36s)]
*  lawyers actually given that to the court or use that, cited that as fraud or criminality? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=974.32s)]
*  Well, first off, the standard- It's a yes or no. Have you? You're a lawyer. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=980.4s)]
*  Yes. They have mentioned this. Which hearing was it at? Because I don't see it in the transcript [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=984.96s)]
*  that happened in the United Climate conversation. As a matter of fact, I'm going to read to you the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=990.96s)]
*  court transcript. Can you proffer any evidence that there was illegal or evidence of abuse or [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=995.68s)]
*  fraud? That any of this was improper or unlawful? EPA lawyer. I'm certainly not suggesting any of [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1000.4s)]
*  that was illegal or improper. Okay. Just yesterday, an EPA lawyer at the hearing suggested, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1006.0s)]
*  we're not accusing anybody of fraud. Did you understand that the evidence for EPA is not [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1013.28s)]
*  to establish criminality at the agency? Well, you're alleging criminality. You did [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1018.8s)]
*  so in a Fox News interview. You said that's what this greenhouse reduction fund was. You [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1022.8s)]
*  shouldn't be doing that if you cannot pro-offer the evidence. But Congresswoman- This is not Fox News. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  We're not going to just allow you to just make allegations here without that evidence. Well, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  if this isn't a media interview, you should allow me to go through the entire list rather than just [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1037.12s)]
*  going through- Well, unfortunately, I only have five minutes and I don't have time for you to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1040.96s)]
*  filibuster. I'm actually for very specific fraud. This should allow me to get through the list. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1044.24s)]
*  Here we got some good questioning from Democratic Senator Wyden. Let's play it. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1049.44s)]
*  You've been getting all these questions from my colleagues with respect to this $165,000 [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1054.0s)]
*  in campaign donations after the announcement that you had been nominated. Is the concern [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1061.44s)]
*  about the possibility that promises were made in exchange for that money? I just want to give you [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1068.8s)]
*  the chance to go over this with me. Did you promise any tax promoter you would help them [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1077.68s)]
*  if you got confirmed? I can answer that with an affirmative no. Okay. So you didn't meet with [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1083.7600000000002s)]
*  anybody when you were in town for the inauguration and promised them a private letter [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  arrangement or something like that? A private letter arrangement. I don't- [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1104.56s)]
*  Where you say we're going to help. We're going to help you if I'm confirmed. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  I haven't promised anybody a letter of any type that I can think of. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1112.9599999999998s)]
*  I was in my room for about 50 hours because I had food poisoning during the inauguration, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1117.52s)]
*  so I didn't talk to many people. Okay. Mr. Long, our staff investigators have on tape now [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1121.28s)]
*  tax promoters saying you met with him at the inauguration and promised him a favorable [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1128.48s)]
*  private letter ruling. We also have on tape the White River CFO who gave you the thousands of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1134.72s)]
*  dollars that he expects favorable treatment of these fake tribal credits. So that's why I'm so [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1141.36s)]
*  troubled by this argument you've given today that, well, you can go over to the FEC and see things. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1149.28s)]
*  That money doesn't just fall out of the sky and land at the FEC, and that's why these taped [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1156.48s)]
*  conversations are so troubling to me. Democratic Senator Baldwin, let's play it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1166.08s)]
*  Any life-saving research at NIH? Is it Doge reviewing NIH funding [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1172.16s)]
*  opportunity announcements? Is it Doge reviewing NIH grant award? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1178.64s)]
*  We've got administrators, we're cutting waste, we're cutting duplicative programs. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1184.08s)]
*  And you're funding $3 billion less in biomedical research than you did a year prior. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1188.4799999999998s)]
*  We're spending less on administration of those programs. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1196.8s)]
*  3,200 fewer grants. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  Many of the grants were terminated because they were grants that were not [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1205.04s)]
*  These are grants terminated. These are grants not awarded because the panels weren't convened. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1209.52s)]
*  We spend 70% of the world's biomedical research out of NIH. 70%. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1215.84s)]
*  And we're the sickest country in the world. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1223.44s)]
*  We're cutting $18 billion or 40% from the NIH budget, slow the development of new [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1225.12s)]
*  treatments and fears. And we are the sickest country in the world. So that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1230.24s)]
*  money has not been well spent. We've had a 38% increase in our agency, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1234.4s)]
*  growth in our agency over the past four years. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1241.84s)]
*  I'll ask you is, is funding for Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's DEI, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1244.24s)]
*  because you're holding up $65 million for 14 of those centers in nine states, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1249.12s)]
*  including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is funding for cancer centers, DEI, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1255.04s)]
*  because you're holding up $47 million in cancer center support grants at nine cancer centers in [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1261.04s)]
*  eight states, is funding for rare disease research, DEI, because you're holding up $55 million [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1267.6s)]
*  for 11 rare disease clinical research network grants in eight states. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1275.76s)]
*  These are just a few examples. And the list goes on and on, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1281.04s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy. I've run out of time. I yield back. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1284.96s)]
*  Thank you. This is a fun game we're playing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1291.28s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, let's talk about clinical questions. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1294.1599999999999s)]
*  And ask questions and don't give me a chance to answer them. Don't give me time to answer them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1297.28s)]
*  Well, maybe in some of my questions, you can, you can elaborate on some of that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1302.24s)]
*  Democratic Senator Warren, let's play it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1306.48s)]
*  I sent you the statute. You've had three weeks to talk to the lawyers about it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1309.2s)]
*  So let's jump in. Mr. Long, is it illegal for the president to direct the IRS to revoke [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1313.6s)]
*  a taxpayer's nonprofit status? In the first place, he wouldn't do that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1320.32s)]
*  He's not going to come to me and say that. That's not my question, Mr. Long. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  Please don't start down this. Are we on section 7212 or 7217? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1330.8s)]
*  I'm at 26 USC 7217. Do I need to read it to you? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  Prohibits any member of the executive branch to request the IRS to conduct or terminate [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1340.3999999999999s)]
*  an audit on a taxpayer. All right. So is it illegal? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1345.92s)]
*  I'm going to follow the law. And if that's the law, yes. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1350.4s)]
*  Okay. But I want you, that is the law. Yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1352.96s)]
*  So I just want to be clear. Is it illegal for the president of the United States to instruct the IRS [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1355.52s)]
*  to remove a taxpayer's nonprofit status? Prohibits any member of the executive [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1362.16s)]
*  branch to request the IRS to conduct or terminate an audit of the taxpayer. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1369.52s)]
*  Is that a yes? I'd have to go to the lawyers at the IRS to tell me. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  No, come on. You just read it. I know. But I don't see the instance that you're [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1380.24s)]
*  speaking about in there. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1385.2s)]
*  Look, it says it shall be unlawful for any applicable person, which in this case includes [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1390.48s)]
*  the president, to request directly or indirectly any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1397.44s)]
*  Service to conduct or terminate an audit or other investigation of any particular taxpayer. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  Is it illegal for the president to instruct the IRS to remove nonprofit status from a taxpayer? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1416.96s)]
*  I'm not going to have the answer that you need. I apologize, but it, like I said. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1427.0400000000002s)]
*  Why are you not having the answer? You've had three weeks to consult with lawyers. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1431.6000000000001s)]
*  The statute is about as clear as plain English. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1435.76s)]
*  What if I say I'm going to follow the law? Why would you need to ask me the question? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1439.44s)]
*  Well, because I want to make sure that you understand what the law says. If you think [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1442.4s)]
*  follow the law means you just get to make it up on the spot, then you don't get to be the IRS [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1448.64s)]
*  commissioner. And then of course, I think the clip of the day, I have to put it in this video, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1455.2s)]
*  is Democratic Senator Hassan from New Hampshire. This is how it's done. Let's play it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1460.56s)]
*  So secretary, what is habeas corpus? Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gigQn8igFic&t=1467.68s)]
