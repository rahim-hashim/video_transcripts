*  I said it last night, but happy Trump is best Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=23.76s)]
*  And he's having a great time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=27.48s)]
*  He doesn't care about these stupid polls. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=28.8s)]
*  He's fighting for the- [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=30.64s)]
*  Laura Ingraham, really? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=31.64s)]
*  I'm glad you think that it's amazing that Donald Trump is having fun because may I talk [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  about your sister company also owned by Rupert Murdoch, The Wall Street Journal, their headline [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=38.56s)]
*  yesterday? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=44.96s)]
*  Trump's first 100 days were worst for Dow and S&P 500 since Richard Nixon in 1973. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=46.28s)]
*  JP Morgan says that based on the new data they have, they believe first quarter GDP [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=56.080000000000005s)]

*  back, negative 2, negative 2.5%. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=68.64s)]
*  Consumer confidence is at its lowest level ever, but glad Donald Trump is having fun. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=72.04s)]
*  Folks, the propaganda got more intense from there yesterday because Fox has to create [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=77.2s)]
*  this fantasy world, this fugazi. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=82.36s)]
*  Fox fugazi. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Watch this clip as Ainsley Earhart, who's sitting there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=86.8s)]
*  By the way, she's Sean Hannity's wife. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=91.56s)]
*  And then she soon sits there with Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, and his wife, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=94.48s)]
*  who also works for Fox. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=99.36s)]
*  But here Ainsley Earhart said Trump is such a good communicator. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=101.08s)]
*  He communicates so good. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=104.6s)]
*  He's so smart. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=105.84s)]
*  He's so smart. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=106.84s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  I watched the press conference yesterday when the Phillies, when the Eagles were at the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  White House, and he is so good at communicating. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=112.08s)]
*  It's such a gift because if we had to do that, I don't know enough about football. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=116.16s)]
*  I would be a nervous wreck, but he knows about every sport. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=120.24s)]
*  He knows about trade. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=122.36s)]
*  He knows about the border. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=123.88s)]
*  He's so equipped for this job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=125.36s)]
*  And I think he's having more fun. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=127.0s)]
*  Even said that in an interview with the Atlantic, he's having more fun this go round. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=128.28s)]
*  But he talked to the coach. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  He brought the security guy up who loves Donald Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=134.6s)]
*  He talked to the owner. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=138.8s)]
*  He talked to all the players. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=140.2s)]
*  He talked about the plays and how they beat the Chiefs this time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  It was just I watched that press conference and I thought he is gifted. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=145.2s)]
*  Well, and to the let's pull the audience. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  In fact, we're going to go out in the audience. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=151.04s)]
*  Dean Baker says, Imagine that your job requires you to constantly praise to the sky a demented, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=152.84s)]
*  vindictive 78 year old man. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=160.48s)]
*  I guess everyone has to put food on the table. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=163.16s)]
*  Going to that next clip I was just talking about. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  You have Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, sitting there with his wife right there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=169.52s)]
*  His wife has a show on Fox as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=174.8s)]
*  And Sean Duffy says, It's been historic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump's done so much. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=180.44s)]
*  This is the good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=182.4s)]
*  He goes, he says this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=183.4s)]
*  He goes, I pinch myself because he's doing so good and he gets to talk to me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=184.52s)]
*  I pinch myself, he says, play this clip. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=190.0s)]
*  Under days I'm dizzy, you know, following everything he's doing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=192.28s)]
*  I can't keep up with him, let alone what all the other cabinet secretaries are doing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=195.84s)]
*  The president's been historic and how much he's done, how fast he's moving and to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=199.88s)]
*  part of that and our family to be part of it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=203.16s)]
*  So we got to go to these White House events. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=205.0s)]
*  And again, I think as we'll look back, you know, 20 years from now, 30 years from now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=206.72s)]
*  and go, this man fundamentally changed the way that America works in the relationship [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=211.8s)]
*  that we have with our government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=215.72s)]
*  I just and be part of that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=216.72s)]
*  I still pinch myself that I got to call the president and he'll pick up my call or call [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=218.16000000000003s)]

*  It's really remarkable. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=223.28s)]
*  And he's just I saw him yesterday. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=224.72s)]
*  He doesn't stop. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=227.02s)]
*  He's late for a meeting and he's and he's talking to people and he's and he's talking [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=229.1s)]
*  about policy and he's signing executive orders and he has so much energy and he's so joyful. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=233.34s)]
*  He's got like nine o'clock at night and there's a call from the president saying, Sean, what [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=238.82s)]
*  about if we do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=242.18s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=243.66s)]
*  He doesn't stop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=244.66s)]
*  I'll call him at eight or eight, nine, ten in the morning. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=245.66s)]
*  And if he's busy, he'll call me back at eight, nine, ten o'clock at night. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=248.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=251.62s)]
*  But he calls people back and he's he's so engaged with all the departments. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=252.62s)]
*  It's just wonderful. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=255.78s)]
*  And the children are doing well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=256.78s)]
*  As Ashley recessed, she goes, this is hilarious, honestly, everything about it, the bullshit [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=257.78s)]
*  he's spewing, the audience smiling and nodding like incredibly funny stuff. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=263.26s)]
*  Although, Ashley, I'll say it would be incredibly funny if at the end of the day, this was like [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=268.38s)]
*  actually just like an episode of The Apprentice and we weren't non-consensual participants [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=274.29999999999995s)]

*  But I get the point that you're making. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  Then Treasury Secretary Scott Besson goes on Fox Business because they're talking about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=284.7s)]
*  business. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=289.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=290.9s)]
*  And Treasury Secretary Scott Besson keeps using the stupid word bespoke. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=291.9s)]
*  And he's like Trump's doing bespoke, bespoke deals. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=295.9s)]

*  No. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=459.18s)]
*  Who caused recession? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=460.18s)]
*  Donald Trump adding $8 trillion to the debt and screwing up COVID so badly that supply [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=461.18s)]
*  chains broke down. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=466.46s)]
*  And then when a new president came in and had to actually deal with it, the fire department [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=467.46s)]
*  was blamed for being the arsonist when Trump was the arsonist. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, I can do a whole rant on that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=474.94s)]
*  You've heard me go there before. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=477.78s)]
*  Okay, here Treasury Secretary Scott Besson takes his turn in the Trump Kiss My Ass Club [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=479.06s)]
*  as Aaron Rupert says. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=484.14s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=485.14s)]
*  Larry, it's just the momentum. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=486.14s)]
*  Is President Trump, the amount of momentum, the transparency, the energy that he has brought [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  back to Washington? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=494.38s)]
*  As you said earlier, the common sense, look at the success on securing the border. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=495.78s)]
*  Everyone said, oh, this can't be done. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=501.14s)]
*  And some of the targets that the Biden administration had were in the tens of thousands. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=503.38s)]
*  And I think a few weeks ago, nine people came across the border. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  Most of whom we let in for medical reasons. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=513.94s)]
*  So it's enthusiasm. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=517.82s)]
*  And I think what we've really done here is deals. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=520.2600000000001s)]
*  And then Scott Besson says, I'm not worried about consumers or even manufacturers paying [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=525.5s)]
*  more money or running out of stuff. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=531.86s)]
*  They've done pre-ordering, pre-ordering, bespoke, pre-ordering. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  What did we talk about two days ago? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=538.62s)]
*  As I've said many times, I think from the Chinese side, these high tariffs are unsustainable. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=540.86s)]
*  I believe that US buyers did a substantial amount of pre-ordering. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=547.98s)]
*  And now the factories in China are having to shut down. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=555.1s)]
*  And I've seen some very large estimates of potential worker layoffs if these tariffs [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=560.38s)]
*  stay in place. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=566.62s)]
*  So what I can tell you is the tariffs are unsustainable on the Chinese side. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=567.74s)]
*  That we have a deficit with them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=574.54s)]
*  The surplus country always suffers more. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=576.42s)]
*  And they sell us roughly five times more than we sell them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=579.46s)]
*  Subdeals. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=586.14s)]
*  Donald Trump did 200 subdeals. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=587.42s)]
*  We're not going to tell you what they are. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=589.14s)]
*  My 200 subdeals. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=591.58s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=592.58s)]
*  He has made 200 deals on tariffs. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=594.26s)]
*  200 deals? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=598.22s)]
*  Who has he made deals with? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=599.22s)]
*  Is there actually any deal at this point? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=601.02s)]
*  I believe that he is referring to subdeals within the negotiations we're doing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=604.22s)]
*  As Aaron Rupar says, North Korean TV had a bit of difficulty finding people to praise, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=611.06s)]
*  dear leader. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=616.18s)]
*  So yesterday for Trump's disastrous 100 days for them to try to make up for the fact that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=617.78s)]
*  their pollster has trumped the worst ever in modern presidential history. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=623.14s)]
*  The Fox poll has trumped at like 41 percent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=627.3s)]
*  I think the Reuters, Washington Post, Ipsos, ABC1 is like 39 percent. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=630.18s)]
*  The worst polling data ever. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=636.5799999999999s)]
*  So Fox assembles this panel knowing Donald Trump watches it in the morning. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=638.64s)]
*  I want you just to watch the degree of BS here. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=643.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=647.26s)]
*  This is what the president said he would do. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=648.5s)]
*  He would make course corrections and go. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=650.5799999999999s)]
*  Do you think the American public is getting that perspective? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=652.74s)]
*  I do to a point. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=659.62s)]
*  I think people are a little bit nervous at this point, but I think we have to give them [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=661.3399999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=665.5799999999999s)]
*  We elected him because we wanted a change. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  We needed a change and that's why he was elected into office, to make a difference. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=668.98s)]
*  And I think, you know, 100 days he's done great things. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=673.78s)]
*  He's scared a few people. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=677.2199999999999s)]
*  I think we need to give him a chance to follow through on his plan because I do think he's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=679.8199999999999s)]
*  got like Dominic's got great people in his corner and, you know, smart people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  And he's a businessman. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=688.86s)]
*  He's not a politician. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=690.1s)]
*  And I think we have to give him a chance to go forward with his plan. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=691.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=694.38s)]
*  Let's let's get your reaction to this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=695.38s)]
*  In spite of whatever rough patches we may have seen, President Trump supporters are [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=696.54s)]
*  standing behind him. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  Take a look at the Fox business. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  Maria Bartiroma then brings on Senator Haggerty, who goes, this has been the greatest 100 [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=704.78s)]
*  days in my lifetime, the most impactful, the most positive we've ever been. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=710.98s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=715.82s)]
*  I know you all are at work trying to move the president's agenda forward. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=716.82s)]
*  Your colleagues on the left and the Senate Democrats want to stage big protests. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=728.5s)]
*  I think in reality, Maria, they're protesting because this has been the most effective, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=730.14s)]
*  most impactful in a positive sense, 100 days, certainly in my lifetime. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=733.82s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=738.5s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=739.5s)]
*  May I show you this headline right here? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=740.5s)]
*  China responds to Trump tariffs with defiant propaganda clip, comparing making a deal with [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=744.62s)]
*  Trump to drinking poison to quench your thirst. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=751.2s)]
*  This is from the China Foreign Ministry. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=755.0200000000001s)]
*  They say, bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=757.0200000000001s)]
*  It only deepens the crisis. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=762.54s)]
*  We're nowhere near making a deal with China. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=765.98s)]
*  Let's be very clear here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=768.16s)]
*  Trump besant lying about having communications with China and Trump speaking to Xi Jinping. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=770.9s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=777.14s)]
*  Canada, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, other countries in Asia, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=778.9s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=787.14s)]
*  seeing, whoa, looks like Xi Jinping's more reliable than Trump. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=789.14s)]
*  Significantly, like maybe we should just be trading with them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=794.1s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=797.42s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=798.42s)]
*  And in terms of Donald Trump making us even less safe internationally, Pakistan has credible [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=800.58s)]
*  intelligence that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=807.26s)]
*  hours. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=812.74s)]
*  Oh, I thought Donald Trump was going to stop all that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=813.74s)]
*  The issue is when America has ceded its authority as a leader in the world, stuff like that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=815.82s)]
*  is more likely to happen. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=821.2600000000001s)]
*  And who do we have? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  Pete Hegseth? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  That's who we have. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=825.1800000000001s)]
*  Rubio? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=826.38s)]
*  We expect those individuals to deal with it? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=827.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=829.74s)]
*  Finally, let me show you this clip right here. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=831.6600000000001s)]
*  Stephen Miller on Fox. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=834.1400000000001s)]
*  Short clip because I can't do long clips of Miller. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=836.46s)]
*  And here Fox and Miller are bragging about intimidating Jeff Bezos of Amazon to remove [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=839.14s)]
*  from the Amazon website where they were going to list the extra cost of your products that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=846.54s)]
*  are caused by tariffs. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=853.62s)]
*  Stop the testing as Donald Trump says, right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=856.66s)]
*  Remember he said during COVID, if we don't show you the tariffs and the costs that are [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=858.86s)]
*  going to you, you'll just think that it doesn't exist. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=862.9399999999999s)]
*  You won't even know it exists. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=865.98s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=867.26s)]
*  But I understand there might have been a phone call from the president to Jeff Bezos on this [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=868.66s)]
*  this morning. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=871.62s)]
*  I have no news to add on it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=872.62s)]
*  All I can say is that things worked out, John, exactly as they should. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=873.9s)]
*  And the president is going to continue. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=877.9s)]
*  Remember, what's our objective here? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=878.9s)]
*  Our objective is we want these products, we want these supply chains to the extent possible [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=880.5s)]
*  to be manufactured here in America where they will benefit from a lower corporate tax, they [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=886.06s)]
*  will benefit from a significant deregulation and the most affordable abundant energy anywhere [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=890.86s)]
*  in the world. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=896.46s)]
*  By the way, can I just give us some simple logic here? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=898.1s)]
*  Donald, if tariffs are so amazing, if they're making us so rich, you're a marketing guy, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=901.86s)]
*  why wouldn't you want to brand everything with your tariffs? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=908.26s)]
*  If tariffs are amazing, don't you want to put tariffs everywhere, make billboards of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=912.0600000000001s)]
*  tariffs, trump tariffs if they're so good? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=916.38s)]
*  Also, if the tariffs are working so well, let me ask you this, Donald, then why are [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=919.34s)]
*  you trying to negotiate deals to remove the tariffs with countries? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=924.3s)]
*  Why don't you just want to keep them on because we're getting so, so rich right now? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=927.66s)]
*  Or is all this deal talk, Donald, no deals, just about market manipulation, is that what [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=931.74s)]
*  this is really about, that you're manipulating the market? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=937.14s)]
*  That's what I think is happening. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=939.42s)]
*  Talk about a conversation, the market goes up, it goes down, it goes up. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=941.5s)]
*  Who's buying the dips? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=944.42s)]
*  Who's buying it when it gets up? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=945.42s)]
*  I think we know the answer. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TNYP_48MI&t=946.74s)]
