# GOP Witnesses get EXPOSED under CROSS-EXAM at Hearing
**MeidasTouch:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM)
*  So how are Donald Trump's cabinet members responding to the scorching cross-examination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=0.0s)]
*  by Democratic Congress members? What they're doing now is just not answering the questions at all, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=6.08s)]
*  and answering different questions, literally giving the middle finger to Congress. But [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=12.4s)]
*  Mike Johnson is okay with it, because Mike Johnson doesn't even really think the House [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  of Representatives should exist at all. He believes it should just exist for whatever [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=23.28s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to do with it. So much for co-equal branches of government. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=28.24s)]
*  So let me show you some of this recent Democratic cross-examination of Donald Trump's Attorney [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  General, Pam Bondi. So you have Democratic Congress member Morrell, and he's cross-examining [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=39.12s)]
*  Pam Bondi about a decision by the DOJ to construe Donald Trump's pardon for January 6th insurrectionist [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  to also include all of their other criminal conduct in most cases. So if Donald Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=55.36s)]
*  pardoned you for being an insurrectionist, any other kind of related conduct, if the FBI [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=61.92s)]
*  discovered that you were involved in other crimes, under the Trump DOJ by and large, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=68.72s)]
*  you get a pardon for the other crimes as well. So a fair question to ask the Attorney General. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=74.4s)]
*  Watch what took place. Let's play it. In addition to my role here, the committee [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=79.76s)]
*  that I serve on as an authorizer oversees capital security as well as federal elections. So I'm [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=86.48s)]
*  closely following the aftermath of January 6th. Recently, several defendants who received [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=91.04s)]
*  presidential pardons related to that day are now arguing in court that the pardon covers crimes, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=96.4s)]
*  like for instance, illegal firearm possession discovered in a search of an individual's home [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  in California months after January 6th. What's your position on whether the pardons [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=106.64s)]
*  cover these separate offenses? The pardon power rests with the president, not the Department of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=111.52s)]
*  Justice, and some of that is pending litigation, and I cannot discuss pending litigation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=116.56s)]
*  Well, I'm not asking you about who has the right to a pardon. I think as the Department of Justice [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=121.44s)]
*  in February wrote, the pardon is an act of grace which removes the punishment from a crime a person [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=126.88s)]
*  has committed. It further said, in its effect, the granting of a pardon is in no sense the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=132.48s)]
*  overturning of a judgment of conviction. It is an executive action that mitigates or sets aside [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=137.28s)]
*  punishment. So as the chief law enforcement officer, what's your opinion, not the president's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=142.48s)]
*  power, whether he can offer a pardon? That's pretty clear in the Constitution. But for crimes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  committed unrelated to January 6th, would you suggest that the pardons would cover activities [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=152.64s)]
*  or crimes potentially committed outside of that by the same person? Well, I don't know if you're [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=161.92s)]
*  referring to Joe Biden pardoning his son after he said he would not pardon Hunter Biden or the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=167.04s)]
*  commutation of all the sentences that the people that were on death row, I've met with those families, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=172.0s)]
*  and all of those sentences were commuted. I'm not going to comment on pardons on either side of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=179.92s)]
*  aisle. So, well, I'm not asking about either side. I'm asking, you're the chief law enforcement [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=185.12s)]
*  officer in the United States. You have a responsibility directly, you swore no to the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Constitution, not the president, want to know what your views are on the extent to which pardons [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=197.36s)]
*  cover potential crimes committed by individuals who have been pardoned but unrelated to January 6th. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=202.16s)]
*  Do you mean the ones that were done by the auto pin? I'm not going to discuss anything that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=208.56s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I, you know, Mr. Loro accused you of filibuster. I think that's the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  height of filibuster. This is a serious, serious topic. And for you to suggest that you don't have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=220.4s)]
*  an opinion or to divert to other things that had nothing to do with January 6 pardons, I think is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  frankly demeaning to your responsibilities and your job, but then I'll yield back. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=230.72s)]
*  Next, you have Democratic Congresswoman Dean, and she cross-examines Donald Trump's Attorney [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=235.44s)]
*  General, Pam Bondi, about her ties to the Qatari government and her taking huge amounts of money [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=243.84s)]
*  from the Qatari government and not disclosing it during her confirmation hearing. Here, play this clip. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Attorney General, have you ever been registered as an agent of a foreign principal under the Foreign [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=257.44s)]
*  Agents Registration Act? I assume you're talking about when I represented the country of Qatar for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=262.4s)]
*  a very short time. Hold on. No, no, no. Anti-human trafficking for the World Cup. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=270.64s)]
*  Anti-human trafficking for the World Cup. You can't put words in my mouth. You want to talk about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  incompetence. You're the one that said Joe Biden on PBS was competent. You had to retract those words. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, don't insult me publicly. This is so discourteous. This is so outside the committee's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=291.92s)]
*  guidelines. Taking a personal shot at me while swiping at Biden. Very strange and very unprofessional [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=300.16s)]
*  of you. The answer is yes or no, and the answer is yes. You were registered as a lobbyist for Qatar. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=309.12s)]
*  Is that correct? Yes. Never mind. Don't answer. Did you disclose that when you went before the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=315.28s)]
*  Senate for confirmation? Yes or no? No, it was not in your documents. The answer is no. President Trump [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=323.44s)]
*  This was discussed at my confirmation hearings in detail. Well, it was discussed, but you failed to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=332.0s)]
*  bring up the conflict that you had. President Trump recently announced he'd accept that $400 million [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=337.11999999999995s)]
*  Qatar airplane because it was just prettier than the one he was flying around in. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=343.76s)]
*  Is it true that you gave advice that this was legally permissible? Yes or no? I will not discuss [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=348.24s)]
*  any advice that my Office of Legal Counsel gives to the President of the United States on any matter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=356.24s)]
*  When you spoke before the Senate, you said you would ask for ethical advice. Did you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=364.64s)]
*  recuse yourself from that issue? And talking about unprofessional, you say the President wanted to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=369.36s)]
*  jet because it's pretty? Excuse me, this is a Senate, this is an congressional hearing. He [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  said it himself. And then Congresswoman Dean is asking Pam Bondi if she has concerns about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=380.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's conflicts of interest, to which Pam Bondi answers a different question, and as [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=387.36s)]
*  you'll see, she just keeps on bringing up Joe Biden over and over again. Play this clip. April [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=393.04s)]
*  the 2nd. You're a part of this, you know, the President has dabbled in meme coin. He had you, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=398.0s)]
*  the DOJ disband the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. His son recently launched the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=408.24s)]
*  Executive Branch Club, a private club with $500,000 memberships here in D.C. Any of this seemed like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=414.88s)]
*  it might be a problem, might be profiteering from the office, and maybe you and your ethics team [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=425.52s)]
*  might be concerned about these conflicts of interest, your own and the President and his family. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=431.76s)]
*  Yes or no? Any concerns? What I would be concerned about in Pennsylvania are all the child sex cases [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=436.56s)]
*  that we prosecuted, all the CSAM cases that we prosecuted. Did you hear my question? That's what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=443.84s)]
*  I would be concerned about. Congresswoman Dean. Chairman. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=450.0s)]
*  Please let the witness answer the question. She didn't. And I would like to ask you one more [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=454.88s)]
*  question. You're not just complicit in this, you're actively helping and profiting. Isn't it true [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=461.04s)]
*  that on April the 2nd, the same day that Trump announced his chaotic tariff regime that plummeted [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  the stock market, you sold more than $1 million worth of your shares in Trump Media stock. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump Media stock fell 13% in the following days. Seems you avoided that loss. Well done. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  I yield back. May I answer that, Chairman? I complied with my ethics and yeah, I would take [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=486.96s)]
*  a class in financial literacy if you think I profited from that because I lost a tremendous [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=495.11999999999995s)]
*  amount of money. Congresswoman and also on page 25 of my SJ2, it lists my involvement with Cutter [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=499.76s)]
*  for anti-human trafficking for the World Cup. Thank you. And here you have Democratic Congresswoman [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=508.56s)]
*  DeLauro cross-examining Pam Bondi and Pam Bondi basically says, oh, I don't like the way you're [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=515.52s)]
*  asking me that question. I will answer it very calmly unlike you. You're play this clip. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=522.88s)]
*  You asked me a question. You haven't answered my question. So they're going to be out on the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=528.32s)]
*  streets working hand in hand with the DEA to violate. You haven't answered my question. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=532.96s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I'd like an answer to my question. And the question is not being answered. How many [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=537.2s)]
*  ATF law enforcement officers and industry operations investigators do anticipate will be [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  lost to attrition as a result of the funding reduction you are proposing. You are proposing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  a 26% cut to ATF for fiscal year 2026, as well as a 4.4% cut to DEA. So you're going to merge [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=556.24s)]
*  the two agencies together and then you're going to shortchange their resources. So neither one of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=565.2s)]
*  them will be able to do the job that they have been designed to do. You've got a 34% cut to the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  high intensity drug trafficking areas program. No dedicated money at all for the organized crime [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=574.6400000000001s)]
*  drug enforcement task force. So my view is fair to say that the Trump administration proposal [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  shortchanges federal efforts to stop illegal gun trafficking and federal efforts to stop the flow [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=585.84s)]
*  of dangerous illegal drugs like fentanyl. As I was attempting to answer your question very calmly, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=592.96s)]
*  unlike you, what I'm saying. Excuse me, Madam Attorney General. Answer, yes or no. Tell me what [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  the numbers are. I don't want to hear all of your filibuster about this. Go ahead, please tell us the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=610.48s)]
*  numbers. So we are reorganizing. ATF agents want to be out on the street. Okay. Let me answer the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  question for you. I'm going to answer it for you. Mr. Chairman, you give me a certain amount of time [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=622.8s)]
*  and I have a high respect for you, but I don't have to listen nor do my colleagues have to listen to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  a filibuster when it's a simple question. But I have an answer to your question. It's what page 146 [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=635.92s)]
*  of the department's fiscal year 2026 budget and the performance summary explicitly says, and let me [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=642.16s)]
*  quote, ATF will eliminate 541 industry operation investigators, reducing ATF's capacity to regulate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=648.48s)]
*  the firearms and explosive industries by approximately 40% in fiscal year 2026. ATF will [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=660.88s)]
*  perform fewer regulatory inspections. And the department summary goes on to say, and let me quote, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=669.84s)]
*  ATF anticipates a reduction of approximately 284 support personnel and 186 agents based on historical [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=677.76s)]
*  attrition patterns. And these personnel cuts will impact ATF across various functions, unquote. If [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=688.0s)]
*  the capacity to regulate firearms industry is reduced by 40%, if you are losing 186 ATF law [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  enforcement agents on top of that, it is clear the direction you are headed with this budget. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=702.72s)]
*  Now let's bring in Democratic Congress member, Jake Alkencloss. Congress member, I was just showing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=707.84s)]
*  these clips of Pam Bondi's testimony yesterday where she was being cross-examined by [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=713.44s)]
*  Democratic Congress members and her answer to everything was basically Joe Biden, auto pen, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=720.96s)]
*  Joe Biden and not actually answering the questions, or giving some kind of snarky remark [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=727.36s)]
*  and then not answering the questions in filibuster. Look, we saw this with Pete Hegseth, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=735.52s)]
*  who wouldn't answer the questions and he would be just outright like just rude to senators and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  Congress members. Your time is up. You don't get to ask me questions anymore. So I just got to ask [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=746.72s)]
*  you as a member of Congress, when these Trump regime cabinet members show up, they don't bring [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=751.76s)]
*  the budget with them, they're unprepared, they're not answering questions, how are you dealing with [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  this? How do you plan for this? I'm planning for it right now because Secretary Kennedy of Health [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=764.8s)]
*  and Human Services is coming to my committee tomorrow morning and we're going to have to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=772.48s)]
*  address exactly this. It's a confluence of two factors. The first is that the president has [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=776.56s)]
*  appointed people based on loyalty, not based on either professionalism or competence and so you're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  getting witnesses who just don't know their own portfolio. RFK doesn't know the first thing about [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=788.7199999999999s)]
*  Medicare or Medicaid, Pam Bondi doesn't understand due process and down on the line. I will say I [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  just had a hearing with Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and it was refreshing because he actually [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=800.2399999999999s)]
*  understands energy portfolio and I just remark upon that because it's the exception not the rule [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=805.28s)]
*  with this cabinet to actually have a cabinet member who knows what they're talking about. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=809.52s)]
*  The second factor at play here is that congressional Republicans don't take themselves [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  seriously. They don't hold this administration to account, they don't think they're members of a [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=819.04s)]
*  separate and co-equal branch of a government, they think they're courtiers to Mar-a-Lago, they act [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=823.92s)]
*  like it, but here's the question for Democrats. Can we go out to the public and make the case that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=828.9599999999999s)]
*  says including to reluctant Trump voters of 2024, hey listen we know you don't agree with us on [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=834.0s)]
*  everything, but do you want this guy's worst impulses to be checked by Congress? Like do you [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=841.12s)]
*  just want them to have to have a little bit of oversight and accountability for these next two [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=846.88s)]
*  years? Because if you do vote Democrat for House and Senate and we will put a check on his worst [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=851.2s)]
*  ideas. I think that that can win over some of these reluctant Trump voters who swung to him in 24. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=857.36s)]
*  Well if you think about all of the things that he promised, lower prices on day one, that didn't [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=861.92s)]
*  happen, that there would be an end to all wars, that didn't happen, that housing would become [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=869.04s)]
*  affordable, that hasn't happened, that he would stop inflation, that hasn't happened. You can go [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  on and on and on and then there's just the kind of daily betrayals which in all of the distractions [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  sometimes fade. Remember when he said the Doge rebate, that Doge was going to be so successful, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=887.04s)]
*  we're going to give every one of you five, every American gets five thousand dollars from Doge. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  Remember he said that and you know there he's going to go through Fort Knox and find all of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=898.8s)]
*  this gold and we're all going to get rich. He's going to eliminate the IRS because the tariffs [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=904.0799999999999s)]
*  are going to be so successful that all we'll need is an external revenue service. So it's just a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  barrage of lies. You think it's registering with the American people? Yes but we have to connect [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=915.68s)]
*  the dots because the American people over the last decade have been trained and have acclimatized [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=922.2399999999999s)]
*  to his post-truth politics and so what you have to do is be able to connect the dots between his [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=930.64s)]
*  chaos and corruption and the higher costs of daily life and that is what campaigns are built around. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=936.8s)]
*  I think we also have to connect the dots between the chaos and incompetence of his administration [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=945.12s)]
*  and the lawlessness that people are feeling pervade ever more parts of the economy and society. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=951.84s)]
*  Even though Americans actually still broadly agree with President Trump instead of Democrats [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=957.28s)]
*  on immigration for example, they don't like the way he's going about it. They don't want to see [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=963.44s)]
*  unmarked vans with mass officers harass 25 year old graduate students on the streets of Somerville [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=967.76s)]
*  and that disconnect between a policy that he promised people and the images that they are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=974.32s)]
*  seeing that feel viscerally wrong to them, that can register. We saw it with the no kings day [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  protests which were some of the most successful demonstrations in modern American history but [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  now it's on Democrats to build that public pressure into a winning midterm strategy. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=990.24s)]
*  Finally let's talk about RFK and RFK Jr and his disaster. I think it's everything everybody [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  feared frankly and worse and the promises that he even made to senators to secure the needed votes [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1003.76s)]
*  to get confirmed. He lied about getting rid of the board that deals with vaccination review [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1012.0s)]
*  and things like that. I know this is an area too that you've always, I mean you focus on a lot of [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1017.4399999999999s)]
*  areas but this is an area too near and dear to your heart so speak to our audience here about [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1023.84s)]
*  just how bad it is when it comes to this guy. The corruption conspiracy in Quackery is eye-watering. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1030.56s)]
*  RFK has spent the last two decades peddling in pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. One to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  enrich himself and two to sow distrust that has directly led to children dying of preventable [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1043.44s)]
*  infectious diseases and what we have to do is take out the knees of their self-righteousness. The [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1049.76s)]
*  Maha movement has come to Washington DC and it has claimed this mantle of an anti-corruption crusade. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1059.12s)]
*  All of these scientists at the Food and Drug Administration they're all on the take or all of [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1065.76s)]
*  these CDC or Advisory Commission on Immunization Practice professionals they're just grifting. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1069.84s)]
*  The fact of the matter is it is in fact RFK and his henchmen who are engaged in corruption and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1077.4399999999998s)]
*  once we can point that out squarely to the American public I think it undercuts many of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1083.2s)]
*  their pseudoscience claims because people will see them for what they are which is self-serving. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1088.96s)]
*  For example, Cali Means, RFK's chief of staff, functionally chief of staff, he owns and controls [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1093.52s)]
*  his own business on the side which has tripled in value in the last year and which basically [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1099.44s)]
*  hustles supplements and saunas to people using tax or pre-tax dollars and he's changing federal [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1104.48s)]
*  policy to help his own company and that's just one example there are many others of the lieutenants [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1113.12s)]
*  around RFK abusing the public trust. Before we go anything you think that's not getting the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1118.32s)]
*  attention it deserves that while we have this huge audience here you want the American people to know [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1125.12s)]
*  I always like to ask that question when I speak to members of Congress because you often get asked [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1130.32s)]
*  the questions by the interviewer but I'm sure there's things on your mind like I wish I could [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1134.2399999999998s)]
*  just talk about that one there's lots of things but anything in particular? The media's attention [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1138.24s)]
*  has moved from Los Angeles to the Middle East understandably I still though am thinking about [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1143.28s)]
*  those 700 marines deployed to Los Angeles they're deployed from 29 palms which is a training base in [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  Inland Empire California it's where I trained for two years as a platoon commander of infantry I [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1155.44s)]
*  know these marines not personally but I know who they are I train with these kinds of young men and [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  women and these are war fighters who have signed an oath to obey the constitution and to fight [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1165.76s)]
*  America's enemies they are not sweating and bleeding in the desert heat of 29 palms to be [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1174.48s)]
*  used as a political prop for the president in Los Angeles in a grossly unnecessary and illegal [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1179.52s)]
*  deployment of marines for law enforcement purposes they're not trained for it they're not equipped [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1184.8s)]
*  for it it's going to be terrible for their morale and we as Americans have to understand that his [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1189.2s)]
*  abuse of the military for his own political ends it's not just bad for the citizens of the United [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1193.44s)]
*  States it's bad for those service members as well most of them are kids they're under the age of 25 [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYkS91kmeAM&t=1198.88s)]
