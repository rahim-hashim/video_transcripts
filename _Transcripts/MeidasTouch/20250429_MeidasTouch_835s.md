# Trump has PUBLIC MELTDOWN at MIDNIGHT over BAD NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94)
*  Donald Trump was rage posting at midnight last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=0.0s)]
*  This is what he was posting literally at midnight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=4.32s)]
*  The polls from the fake news are like the news itself, fake, puts that in all caps, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=7.12s)]
*  exclamation point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=14.52s)]
*  We are doing great, and that's in caps, better than ever before. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=15.98s)]
*  And his next post, the USA lost billions of dollars a day in international trade under [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=21.3s)]
*  sleepy Joe Biden. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=27.28s)]
*  I have now stemmed that tide and will be making a fortune very soon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  Stay tuned as we make America great again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=34.6s)]
*  You just wait two more weeks, there'll be peace in Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  Two more weeks, he and Xi Jinping are going to cut a deal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=42.12s)]
*  Two more weeks, there's going to be 90 trade deals that are going to be made. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=45.4s)]
*  Two more weeks and everything's just going to be better. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=50.14s)]
*  That's why I call this the Ponzi scheme or rug pull presidency, because literally everything [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=53.88s)]
*  he says is a lie and is a fraud. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  What's interesting too is that Donald Trump was trying to get the support of the International [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Longshore and Warehouse Union, and they were kind of fairly supportive of him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=67.16s)]
*  You saw the head of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the dock workers, acting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=72.4s)]
*  like he was supportive of Donald Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=78.88s)]
*  They just put out a policy statement opposing tariffs and saying, you're costing us all [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=80.76s)]
*  our jobs, you're destroying the economy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  What the hell are you doing, Donald? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=88.58000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you, one of the things that he was doing is he wanted to stage that propaganda [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=91.0s)]
*  scene in front of the White House with the Eagles. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=96.98s)]
*  The White House, they invite the winner of the Super Bowl every year and the various [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=101.04s)]
*  sports championships every year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=105.62s)]
*  Shout out to most of the Eagles who did not show up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=107.68s)]
*  That probably pissed Donald Trump off. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=112.2s)]
*  I don't know, how many players did you have here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Maybe less than half the team and a lot of their superstars didn't show up, notably their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  quarterback Jalen Hurts didn't show up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=121.92s)]
*  A.J. Brown, Devonta Smith, Jalen Carter and others did not show up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  They said there was scheduling conflicts, but they obviously did not want to be used [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  as props and propaganda for an individual who's destroying the United States of America, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=134.0s)]
*  sending migrants to concentration camps and someone who has a history of being racist [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=140.88s)]
*  and attacking black people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=148.88s)]
*  It's Donald Trump's background and past. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=150.28s)]
*  Let's talk about the Canadian election. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=153.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party went on to win the election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=156.44s)]
*  As of this recording and things are evolving quickly, as of the time I recorded this, even [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=161.94s)]
*  though it was called that it would probably be a liberal minority government, I don't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=168.74s)]
*  think the official call has been made yet, but that's the status of where we're at. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=173.82s)]
*  It was unheard of that the Liberal Party would win this election. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=179.28s)]
*  That's called the Trump effect right there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=183.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney will stay the prime minister at least for another period of time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=185.78s)]
*  I'm not sure when the next elections will be. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=190.54s)]
*  We'll see what type of coalition is formed there depending on the results. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  The Canadian voters seem though universally to hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=196.98s)]
*  We heard a lot of things like this from Canadian voters here play this clip. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=200.7s)]
*  I think who I voted for would be the best to take care of Trump because Trump is, I'm [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  sorry to say, an ass-and-a**. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=210.42s)]
*  He shouldn't even be president of the United States, but because he is, we need a strong [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  person so that we can stand strong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=219.38000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And look, Donald Trump is a wrecking ball to the world order. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=222.22s)]
*  He's screwing over the United States. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=226.74s)]
*  Worst of all, you see this from freight waves. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, we've been geeking out on the freight and trucking volume data here on the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  Midas Touch Network now for what ever since Trump declared Liberation Day, which is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  really liquidation day, Great Depression Day, Recession Day, whatever you want to call [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=244.7s)]
*  it. We've been really focused on freight volumes because I wanted to see are the ships [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=249.78s)]
*  leaving the ports of Shanghai and coming to Long Beach? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=254.82s)]
*  Are they leaving from other ports in China and heading to the West Coast? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=257.86s)]
*  And when I see that stopping, it means that products aren't going to reach our shelves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=261.3s)]
*  That means we're going to be missing products and things that we need here in the United [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  States. That means scarcity is coming. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=270.58s)]
*  So Donald Trump can say things are great. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=272.46s)]
*  But the big hit, the way I've described it is like in a tsunami where the shoreline, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  it goes pulls back and pulls back and pulls back. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=281.02s)]
*  It recedes. And then the tsunami hits like that's what's happening right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=283.7s)]
*  And when Donald Trump says it's a miracle, things are great. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=288.14s)]
*  Tariffs are both the greatest thing in the world and they're going to make us rich, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=291.26s)]
*  according to Donald Trump. But also, he's working on all of these deals to get rid of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=295.5s)]
*  the tariffs and he's using it as leverage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=300.06s)]
*  None of it makes sense because it's all a big fraud. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=301.82s)]
*  The same way Trump's been a fraud, a felon, sexual abuser his whole life, most of his [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=303.94s)]
*  life, that's what he's doing right now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=308.98s)]
*  You know, the fraud and the fraud and abusive personality, fraud and just the lies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=313.9s)]
*  Here, this is from Freight Waves. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=320.46s)]
*  No way we can make up for the 30 to 60 percent lost volumes from China via other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=323.34s)]
*  countries due to tariffs, said Miller. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=329.26s)]
*  Unless the 145 percent China tariffs are dropped very soon, I don't see a scenario [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=331.62s)]
*  where this could take place. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=337.26s)]
*  China and Trump aren't even talking. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  As a least of this recording, he's no deals Donald. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  He hasn't been able to make a deal with even places where there were no tariffs, even [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=344.5s)]
*  places where there was trade surpluses, even like he hasn't been able to make a deal [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=349.34s)]
*  with like South Korea. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=353.74s)]
*  He hasn't announced the deal with Japan yet. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=355.38s)]
*  He hasn't been able to make a deal with Australia. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=357.58s)]
*  You know, he hasn't been able to make a deal with Europe. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=360.14s)]
*  He blew up actual trade deals that existed that were benefiting the U.S. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=363.34s)]
*  Donald Trump can act like we were getting screwed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=368.5s)]
*  We were being taken advantage of. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=370.46s)]
*  No, we weren't. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=371.7s)]
*  America was leading the world. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=372.82s)]
*  Capital infusions from the world went into America. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=375.5s)]
*  America was viewed as the safest, most stable economy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=378.74s)]
*  We were winning. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=382.58s)]
*  We were number one under former President Biden. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=383.9s)]
*  Objectively. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=386.1s)]
*  And now we're losing objectively. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  This from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=390.3s)]
*  So Donald Trump to soften the blow of automotive tariffs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  Companies paying Trump's car tariffs won't also be charged for other levies based on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  what Trump's going to be announcing ahead of Donald Trump's to Michigan today. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=401.54s)]
*  He's heading to Michigan for a rally outside Detroit where he's just going to lie about [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  everything. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=409.38s)]
*  He's announcing that he will be softening the automotive tariffs. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=410.66s)]
*  But you claim that they're working and they're making us rich. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=414.02s)]
*  So why would you soften something that's making us rich unless you're just a fraud, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=417.14s)]
*  which is what he is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=421.18s)]
*  You see this moment where Speaker of the House, Magna Mike Johnson was asked by CNN, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=423.5s)]
*  why is the American public souring on Trump's policies here? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=429.86s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=433.18s)]
*  I'm not worried at all. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=434.14s)]
*  I just had a great meeting with the president at the White House and he's in good spirits. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=435.14s)]
*  We talked about the upcoming races, the midterm elections, and we're very bullish on it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=438.86s)]
*  Why is the American public souring on his policies? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=443.06s)]
*  Listen, you know, these are presidential terms or rollercoaster sometimes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=445.7s)]
*  There's been a little tumult in the markets with the tariff policy and all of that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=450.38s)]
*  But I think all this is settling out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=454.14s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's why. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=456.29999999999995s)]
*  Because it's a rollercoaster, Magna Mike. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=457.26s)]
*  That's that's the reason it's a rollercoaster. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=459.02s)]
*  No, it's because people hate him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=462.06s)]
*  As he's destroying the American dream, he's destroying America's economy, he's [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=464.02s)]
*  destroying our alliances. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=467.82s)]
*  I know that you know that I had some pretty bad allergies. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=469.26000000000005s)]
*  I'd read them in the comments and you said, Ben, you got to do something about it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=472.86s)]
*  So I did. I got Alermy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=476.54s)]

*  symptoms as they treat in mine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=490.06s)]

*  expert care is very helpful when I need it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=529.66s)]
*  Alermy's energy kit is so easy to use. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=532.86s)]

*  Plus they deliver it directly to me. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=537.3s)]

*  Donald Trump posted the following on April 27th. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=583.46s)]
*  He goes, thank you to my wonderful friends in Michigan. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=588.06s)]
*  It's going to be great to be here today. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=591.26s)]
*  We're doing great. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=592.62s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=593.34s)]
*  That was in advance of him showing up to Michigan today for this rally that he's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=594.7s)]
*  going to do. Who the heck knows what this rally is even going to be about. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=597.98s)]
*  It's going to be insane. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=601.82s)]
*  Lie after lie. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=603.14s)]
*  Of course, we'll cover it here on the MIDAS Touch Network. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=603.74s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, make sure you check out the virtual Governor's Town Hall. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=606.54s)]
*  That's the one I'm hosting tonight at 8 Eastern, 5 Pacific on our YouTube channel. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=612.42s)]
*  I'll be hosting it live. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=616.42s)]
*  We got four Democratic governors. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=617.8599999999999s)]
*  We have we talk about it on our community page. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=619.9s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=622.0999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be an incredible virtual town hall. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  While all of this is going on too, though, I want to mention this. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=625.02s)]
*  The right wing influencers like Benny Johnson and others are saying that all of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=627.9s)]
*  the polls that show that Donald Trump is underwater, they're all fake polls. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=632.78s)]
*  They're saying they're all PSYOPs and that they're not real polls. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=638.5s)]
*  The Fox poll, the Pew Research, the Reuters, Ipsos poll. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=641.7s)]
*  They're saying they claim all of them are PSYOPs. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=646.1400000000001s)]
*  All of them are false. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=649.1400000000001s)]
*  Every single one they go, which is just utterly ridiculous. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=650.34s)]
*  What were they doing at the White House yesterday? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=654.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, they had new media show up and they were this is like their priorities, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=657.22s)]
*  what they were talking about. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=662.46s)]
*  And they were talking about getting rid of truckers who don't speak English [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=663.7800000000001s)]
*  and getting rid of Uber drivers in Florida who don't speak English. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=668.66s)]
*  Like here was a class right here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=672.66s)]
*  Here is a question right here that was asked. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=674.42s)]
*  You know, well, it wasn't even a question. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=677.74s)]
*  It was like a weird statement by the by this right wing influencer person. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=679.3s)]
*  They were like, well, I just want to let you know that my Uber drivers in Florida [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=683.82s)]
*  don't don't only speak English. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=687.62s)]
*  Thank you, Trump. You did this here. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=690.7s)]
*  Play this clip. An accessible presidency in American history. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=692.3s)]
*  So with that, let's kick it off. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=695.94s)]
*  And I'm happy to take your question first, Erin. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=697.4599999999999s)]
*  So much for having us and for granting me the first question here. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=699.6999999999999s)]
*  Sure. And I can attest to deportations in Florida. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=703.14s)]
*  My Uber drivers finally speak English again. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=705.78s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=707.9399999999999s)]
*  My question for you is, what are the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=709.5s)]
*  administration's plans for those who continue to defy the executive orders? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=711.74s)]
*  Most notably on my mind are the ones related to what some would call trans men. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  I would call men masquerade as trans women, which are men masquerading as girls [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=719.0999999999999s)]
*  in girls sports. Sure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=723.06s)]
*  Obey federal law or you will be prosecuted. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=725.42s)]
*  Obey federal law and you could see your federal funding cut, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=728.62s)]
*  whether you are a college or university. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=732.02s)]
*  We have seen the president again using the leverage of this administration and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=734.34s)]
*  to negotiate deals with some of the biggest colleges and universities in this country. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=739.78s)]
*  And if they don't want to come to the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=743.9399999999999s)]
*  negotiating table to apologize for the federal laws they have broken, to apologize [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=745.26s)]
*  for allowing Jewish American students on our nation's campuses to be unlawfully [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=749.98s)]
*  bullied and harassed, then there is going to be consequences for that illegal behavior. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=753.86s)]
*  What in the world are they even talking about? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=758.9s)]
*  And this is Caroline Levitt bragging about [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=761.98s)]
*  making sure truckers only speak English or play this clip. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=765.46s)]
*  And then the third executive order, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=768.7s)]
*  which actually speaks to the heart of your question earlier about the Uber drivers, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=770.22s)]
*  will be a order directing the Department [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=773.86s)]
*  of Transportation to include English literacy tests for our truckers. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=777.5s)]
*  This is a big problem in the trucking [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=781.4200000000001s)]
*  community that unless you're in that community, you might not know. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=782.78s)]
*  But there's a lot of communication problems between truckers on the road [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  with federal officials and local officials as well, which obviously is a public safety risk. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=789.66s)]
*  So we're going to ensure that our truckers who are the backbone of our economy [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  are all able to speak English. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=798.14s)]
*  That's a very common sense policy in the United States of America. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=799.62s)]
*  So the president will be signing that later this afternoon. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=802.54s)]
*  Yes, you're welcome to the back in the yellow tie. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=804.9s)]
*  There you have it, folks. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  We'll keep you posted every step of the way with more news. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQR85zTw94&t=808.5799999999999s)]
