# MAGA Mike gets BAD NEWS as Bill BLOWS UP on LIVE TV
**MeidasTouch:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs)
*  Yesterday was catastrophic for Speaker of the House, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  He had a cataclysmic, awful, terrible appearance or appearances [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=4.84s)]
*  when he did the Sunday news shows. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=10.92s)]
*  But also the Mago Republicans in the Senate were saying that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=13.88s)]
*  this budget bill is a disaster. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=18.68s)]
*  And these Republicans in the Senate said that they were going to block it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=21.28s)]
*  So it's going to be interesting to see what Maga Mike does. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Also, Maga Mike was mumbling and stumbling when he was asked question on the Sunday shows. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  He tried to attack the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=33.8s)]
*  but we all showed you here on the Midas Touch Network, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=36.56s)]
*  the literal talking points that he was passing out to other Mago Republicans earlier in the week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=39.4s)]
*  He had to admit that he was just straight up attacking his own constituents in Louisiana. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Louisiana has the second most Americans on food stamps, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=51.68s)]
*  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=57.08s)]
*  and they've got millions of people on Medicaid as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=59.36s)]
*  And there's hundreds of thousands of people on Medicaid in Maga Mike's district [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=61.96s)]
*  who are going to lose their Medicaid. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=65.48s)]
*  So Maga Mike had to admit during his appearances that he thinks that the people living in his district, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=67.68s)]
*  mostly we're talking about Republican people because it's a safe Republican district, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=74.84s)]
*  are fraudsters, are basically all criminals, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  and that's why they're getting Medicaid and he's going after his own people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=83.12s)]
*  Let me break this all down for you because this was a sight to behold. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=87.2s)]
*  So you had Maga Republican Senator Rand Paul saying that somebody's got to stand up against this atrocious, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  ridiculous, horrible budget bill. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=99.04s)]
*  And then he described Donald Trump and Maga Mike as the emperors with no clothes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=101.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Somebody has to stand up and yell, the emperor has no clothes, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=106.8s)]
*  and everybody's falling in lockstep on this, pass the big, beautiful bill, don't question anything. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=111.0s)]
*  Well, conservatives do need to stand up and have their voice heard. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=116.88s)]
*  This is a problem we've been facing for decades now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=120.44s)]
*  And if we don't stand up on it, I really fear the direction of the country is going. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=124.0s)]
*  Then you had Maga Republican Johnson from Wisconsin, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=128.44s)]
*  And he says that the budget bill is immoral, it's going to bankrupt America, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=135.23999999999998s)]
*  that he will derail it in the Senate, which is an interesting point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=140.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  President Trump has suggested that the debt is not really top of mind of his concerns. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=146.28s)]
*  He wants Republicans to fall in line. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=150.16s)]
*  He wants Republicans to pass the bill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  You told CNN, quote, somebody's got to be the dad that says, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  I know you all want to go to Disney World, but we can't afford it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  I guess I'm going to be that guy, unquote. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  So how determined are you to be that guy if it actually means telling President Trump, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=163.2s)]
*  you are going to vote against the bill and you're going to try to get other Republican senators [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=168.56s)]
*  to join you unless there are major, major changes? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=173.44s)]
*  Well, in 2010, I sprang out of the Tea Party movement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  And as I did praise my, I would shout, this is a fight for freedom. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=181.48s)]
*  We are mortgaging our children's future. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  It's wrong. It's immoral. It has to stop. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=187.64s)]
*  I haven't changed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=190.16s)]
*  My campaign promise in 2010 and every campaign after that was to stop mortgaging our children's future. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=191.32s)]
*  It's immoral. It's wrong. It has to stop. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=197.4s)]
*  And so he may not be worried about that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  I am extremely worried about that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=202.88s)]
*  That is my primary goal running for Congress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=204.68s)]
*  This is our moment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=208.24s)]
*  We have witnessed an unprecedented level of increased spending, 58 percent since 2019, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  other than World War II. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=214.92s)]
*  This is our only chance to reset that to a reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=217.88s)]
*  And again, I think you can do it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  And the spending that we would eliminate, people wouldn't even notice. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=224.4s)]
*  But you have to do the work, which takes time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=227.56s)]
*  Back to Rand Paul. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=229.8s)]
*  Rand Paul said, I'll tell you how I, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Magna Republican Rand Paul from Kentucky, he goes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=234.96s)]
*  let me just make it very easy for all of you know how we know this is going to add at least four trillion dollars to the deficit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=237.36s)]
*  He goes, they're raising the debt ceiling in the budget bill by four trillion dollars. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  He goes, that means what they're preparing for is to at least have two trillion dollars in deficits each year for the next two years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  Basically, he goes, that's guaranteed here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=261.32s)]
*  When March, every Republican, virtually every Republican other than me, voted to continue the Biden spending levels, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  which are going to give us a two point two trillion dollar deficit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=268.08s)]
*  Now, if you increase the debt ceiling four to five trillion dollars, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=271.24s)]
*  that means they're planning on two trillion this year and more than two trillion next year. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=274.52s)]
*  That's just not conservative. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  So I've told them if they strip out the debt ceiling, I'll consider even with the imperfections voting for the rest of the bill. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=280.28s)]
*  But I can't vote to raise the debt ceiling five trillion. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  There's got to be someone left in Washington who thinks debt is wrong and deficits are wrong and wants to go in the other direction. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  The idea that we're going to explode deficits and the projections are now looking at over three trillion dollars in deficits over the next 10 years, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=295.2s)]
*  I think is just not a serious proposal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=302.64s)]
*  All right. So now the Maga Mike Johnson disastrous appearance right here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=305.76s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson is confronted with the fact that Goldman Sachs, you know, they want to call what Goldman Sachs a lefty organization. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=310.48s)]
*  He goes Goldman Sachs says that any potential growth that could come from this budget bill will be eliminated by Trump's disastrous tariff policy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=320.24s)]
*  and by Trump's disastrous economic plans to date here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=331.8s)]
*  Play this clip about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the US, because we did it followed a very simple formula. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=335.48s)]
*  We cut taxes and we cut regulations. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=341.96s)]
*  You didn't do it in the middle of a war. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=344.0s)]
*  Steroids in the first administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=345.64s)]
*  There was sequencing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=347.96s)]
*  You got tax reform. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=349.0s)]
*  The Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=350.2s)]
*  Goldman Sachs says the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  That's Goldman Sachs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, well, I know I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=361.24s)]
*  legislation and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=369.2s)]
*  You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the US right now because of the president's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=373.8s)]
*  insistence that that be done. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=381.0s)]
*  And it was decades overdue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=382.44s)]
*  That is going to benefit every American is going to benefit the consumers. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=384.08s)]
*  You know, they they howled when the first tariffs, reciprocal tariffs policy was announced and they said that prices would skyrocket. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=387.88s)]
*  That simply hasn't happened. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=395.84s)]
*  Many of those early estimates were were far off and that's being proven now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=397.08s)]
*  So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=401.04s)]
*  This legislation will pass and get the economy going again and people will feel that they'll see it in their own pocketbooks and their [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=405.48s)]
*  own opportunity. And every American household is going to benefit by these policies. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=411.52s)]
*  You know, Wal-Mart has already said that it will have to raise prices. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=415.52s)]
*  It's not theoretical. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=419.36s)]
*  And the president on Friday was talking about even more tariffs this time on Apple and others. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=420.84s)]
*  And by the way, folks, Goldman Sachs of all of the kind of banks out there, they've been the most kind of bullish and only [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=425.56s)]
*  recently have they really gone bearish. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  I've been reading their reports, you know, in the morning. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=437.04s)]
*  Sometimes I I want to read you their reports, not because I'm like love reading Goldman Sachs reports to you, but it's just [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  important to see, OK, what are like the bankers out there saying? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  So here, Maga Mike Johnson is confronted with the fact that in his state, people depend on supplemental nutrition assistance [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=449.24s)]
*  program food stamps and that he's going to destroy his own state here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=458.6s)]
*  Play this clip. We don't want to slash benefits. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=462.2s)]
*  And again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=464.88s)]
*  We are not cutting SNAP. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=467.92s)]
*  We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=469.2s)]
*  SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics in twenty twenty four, over eleven billion dollars in SNAP payments were [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=471.6s)]
*  erroneous. I mean, that's that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=479.24s)]
*  It may be much higher than that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  It's like the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=484.16s)]

*  The states, the states are not properly administering this because they don't have enough skin in the game. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=489.68s)]
*  So what we've done in the bill is add some just a modest state sharing component so that they'll pay attention to that so that we can [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=495.12s)]
*  reduce fraud. Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=501.16s)]
*  This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  We live in an environment that our biology was never designed for. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=510.8s)]
*  EMF's artificial light, seed oils, microplastics, endocrine disruptors, chronic stress. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=514.52s)]

*  where the top 220 holders of Trump's meme coin got access to Donald Trump, which they said was in Trump's personal time. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=594.44s)]
*  And Magomike's like, look, I don't know anything about it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=602.6s)]
*  I've just been too busy here playing this clip. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=605.32s)]
*  President Trump held a closed door event Thursday night for top investors in his private cryptocurrency. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=607.48s)]
*  We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=617.0400000000001s)]
*  The president has, of course, a huge role to play when it comes to regulation, regulating crypto. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=621.24s)]
*  I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=626.44s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know anything about the dinner. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  I was a little busy this past week, as you know, getting the reconciliation package over the line. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=637.12s)]
*  And so I'm not going to comment on something I haven't even heard about. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=642.28s)]
*  I'm not sure who was there, what the purpose was. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=645.44s)]
*  But I'll say this. President Trump is very active. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=647.32s)]
*  He's very engaged. He's the greatest dealmaker, one of the greatest dealmakers of all time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=649.88s)]
*  He is working on these trade imbalances that we've had and having tremendous success. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=655.32s)]
*  We've got over 75 countries now renegotiating their trade agreements with America. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=659.8s)]
*  It's going to make it better for all of us, everybody in the country. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=664.0s)]
*  And he is encouraging new technologies, crypto and the advancement of AI. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=667.28s)]
*  He's appointed as czar for the first time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=672.64s)]
*  We have an AI czar in David Sachs, who's an expert in the industry from Silicon Valley. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=674.76s)]
*  There's a lot of exciting things happening. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=679.28s)]
*  The president is trying to encourage that along as much as he can. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=681.4s)]
*  And I think the vast majority of the country is applauding those efforts. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=685.24s)]
*  So I'm one of them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=688.44s)]
*  I think the result of all this is going to be extraordinary for all everybody in the country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=689.84s)]
*  As Mehdi Hassan says, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=693.6400000000001s)]
*  ah, top congressional Republicans are back too. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=695.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm pretending not to know about the huge Trump scandal that everyone is talking about. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=698.9200000000001s)]
*  So I don't comment on it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=703.48s)]
*  Deflection strategy that they deployed in the first Trump term. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  And I guess our media will let them use it again. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, Mehdi, you know and I know we're the captains of the ship now. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  We're the media now. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=716.5200000000001s)]
*  Your independent media company is the media now. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=717.6400000000001s)]
*  And so we're able to point it out to bigger audiences than corporate news. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=720.72s)]
*  Here's another clip of Maga Mike Johnson here. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=727.16s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=730.16s)]
*  So one point four million people in your home state of Louisiana are in Medicaid. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=731.84s)]
*  More than 800000 receive SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=736.48s)]
*  Is it your contention that if any of those [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=742.84s)]
*  Louisiana's lose their benefits, it's because they shouldn't have been [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=745.64s)]
*  receiving them because they were committing waste, fraud or abuse. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=748.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, my district is every district [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=754.32s)]
*  in America has people who are on the program who shouldn't. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=756.72s)]
*  And when you're talking about, I keep using this example, a young, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=759.64s)]
*  able-bodied man with no dependence, there's no reason he should not be working. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=762.88s)]
*  We are the party about that that supports human dignity. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=766.52s)]
*  And we find purpose and dignity in our work. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=769.88s)]
*  It's good for the individuals involved. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  It's good for their community. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=773.76s)]
*  And the Democratic Congress members, you know, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=775.24s)]
*  I think that they were on a roll. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=778.12s)]
*  They were fighting back pretty hard on the weekend shows. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=780.48s)]
*  Here's a Democratic Congress member, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=783.84s)]
*  Himes, you've seen him before on the Midas Touch show. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=786.08s)]
*  Margaret, I got to tell you, it was like listening to 1984 or something. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=788.64s)]
*  Listen to the speaker, you know, anybody can look this up. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=792.48s)]
*  The American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=795.52s)]
*  Number one, at this point in time when Americans, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=799.08s)]
*  the wealthiest Americans are doing better than ever before. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=802.2s)]
*  Americans want the wealthiest of the of Americans to pay more taxes [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=806.64s)]
*  and to give tax relief to the middle class and below. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=812.44s)]
*  Number two, they want us to address the deficit, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=814.96s)]
*  which is now spiraling out of control to the point where we got a downgrade [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  in one of the US credit ratings. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=821.96s)]
*  And third, they want a simpler tax code. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  This bill spails fails spectacularly on all three counts. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=825.48s)]
*  They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=829.72s)]
*  assistance, food stamps to tens of millions of Americans in order to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=832.96s)]
*  preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=836.08s)]
*  They're adding three trillion dollars to the deficit with this bill. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=838.48s)]
*  And lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with you don't have to pay taxes on tips. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=841.72s)]
*  Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, auto lending. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=849.24s)]
*  they want the Congress to do this bill fails spectacularly. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=852.4000000000001s)]
*  Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon as Americans come [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=855.88s)]
*  to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=859.0s)]
*  Here's Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  Beyond that, beyond the fact that it's just really a cruel bill, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=864.88s)]
*  it's this idea that they are going to somehow be fiscally responsible. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=869.52s)]
*  When we know under the first Trump administration, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=875.84s)]
*  they ran the national deficit up eight trillion dollars. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=878.52s)]
*  And with this one bill, they want to raise [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=881.44s)]
*  the debt ceiling an additional five trillion dollars. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  So here is the deal. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=886.76s)]
*  If we have cut off everything that would help somebody, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=888.2s)]
*  which doesn't sound like a very Christian thing to do. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=891.72s)]
*  If we're going to do all of that, at least have something to show for it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=894.36s)]
*  They have nothing to show for it, except for, again, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  those top earners being able to say, have their next trophy wife or buy their next [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  yacht or get their next plane. That doesn't work for me. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  And that obviously does not work for my constituents. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=910.44s)]
*  Here's Congresswoman Crockett again. Let's play it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=913.36s)]
*  I don't know where he's ever going to go. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=915.84s)]
*  And I don't think that those that have gone [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=918.2s)]
*  through West Point expected to have their commander in chief address them and start [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=920.76s)]
*  talking about trophy wives or start talking about how he had so many [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=926.9200000000001s)]
*  investigations, what a great reminder that you are not qualified to be the person [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=931.1600000000001s)]
*  that potentially will command us as troops to go into war. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=936.44s)]
*  Like that is not instilling confidence whatsoever. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=940.76s)]
*  And honestly, our troops deserve better. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=944.44s)]
*  Our graduates deserve better. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=947.32s)]
*  We as a country deserve better. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=949.24s)]
*  And frankly, if we are going to ever be seen as the world leaders that we [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=951.32s)]
*  historically have been, the world deserves better. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  It is time for Republicans to start calling him out and start questioning his [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  mental acuity and whether or not he is equipped to serve mentally. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=962.44s)]
*  We know when it comes down to his criminality, he is not qualified to serve. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=967.32s)]
*  But this is just absolutely deplorable. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=973.12s)]
*  Finally, Mike Johnson saying that he believes the CBO report is just inaccurate. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=975.28s)]
*  We can't trust a nonpartisan CBO, even though Mike Johnson consistently cited it [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=981.9599999999999s)]
*  before, but he's like, we can't we can't look at it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=987.56s)]
*  Just don't look at the numbers. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=991.36s)]
*  What's really important here to to point out, Shannon, is that some of the estimates, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  for example, by the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, are wildly inaccurate. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  They're they're assuming a historically low growth rate in the economy. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1000.72s)]
*  The elements of the big, beautiful bill, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1004.68s)]
*  the reason we're so excited is because it will be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1006.68s)]
*  This is going to foster a pro growth economy again to get job creators and [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1010.28s)]
*  entrepreneurs and risk takers moving again, expanding their businesses, adding more jobs. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1014.64s)]
*  Wages will go up. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1019.0s)]
*  We'll have more manufacturing in the U.S. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1020.12s)]
*  because of all the policies that we put into this legislation. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1022.0s)]
*  It's a long time coming. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1024.84s)]
*  And remember, not theoretical. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  We did this before in the first Trump administration. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  We brought in the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1030.76s)]
*  after just those first two years. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1034.04s)]
*  Because we cut taxes and cut regulations, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1036.04s)]
*  we're doing it again and on steroids this time. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  You all remember the example that I give. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1041.12s)]
*  It's that movie on Netflix. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1043.8s)]
*  It's called Don't Look Up. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1045.52s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio is in it with the with the asteroid that's coming down to to hit Earth. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1046.92s)]
*  They discover the asteroid, all of these experts, and they're warning and they know [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  the asteroid is going to hit Earth and they see it coming. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1056.8s)]
*  They see it coming. They see it coming. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1059.04s)]
*  And because of all of the disinformation out there and the propaganda networks and [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1060.76s)]
*  the regime in the White House, in the movie is very similar, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1066.9599999999998s)]
*  has similarities to the Trump regime and they want to like distract people. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  And so anyway, there's a whole campaign of Don't Look Up. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1076.1999999999998s)]
*  Just don't don't see the asteroid that's about to hit and destroy the Earth. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  And to me, that's kind of like the moment [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1084.08s)]
*  that we're in now with the MAGA Republican Congress members. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1086.4399999999998s)]
*  And regime media, which I don't just consider Fox corporate news in general [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1089.84s)]
*  that wants to cover up for Donald Trump, they're like, don't look at it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1094.48s)]
*  Just don't look at it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1097.48s)]
*  And we here at the Midas Touch Network, we are the the look up network. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1098.96s)]
*  Look at the asteroid, see what's happening. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1104.1200000000001s)]
*  That's why I keep on talking about FEMA, FEMA, FEMA over and over. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  How many times do you hear me talk about FEMA? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1110.28s)]
*  Because I'm like the Trump regime gutted FEMA where what a week away from hurricane [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1112.4s)]
*  season, it's going to be a bigger than average or there's going to be more [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1116.84s)]
*  hurricanes this season than normally. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1120.52s)]
*  That's going to be a problem where you [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1122.04s)]
*  gut FEMA, the National Weather Service, Trump's gutted the National Oceanic [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1124.08s)]
*  Administration, the Atmospheric Administration. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1129.48s)]
*  Donald Trump gutted. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1132.84s)]
*  They forecast these things. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1134.1999999999998s)]
*  Our weather balloons are not going up anymore. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1135.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, we've gutted critical people, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  critical groups that study infectious disease. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  The Trump regime is not letting Americans under the age of 65. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1144.4s)]
*  If they deem you to be healthy, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1148.92s)]
*  you can't get covid vaccines starting in the fall. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1151.88s)]
*  They're going to block you from getting covid vaccines. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1154.72s)]
*  They are spreading disinformation about measles. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1157.48s)]
*  You know what? They've gutted with the FAA. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1161.0s)]
*  And now our airports are an absolute mess. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1163.48s)]
*  We have missing air traffic controllers. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1166.92s)]
*  We have radar that's going down. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1169.36s)]
*  You know, there are systemic issues. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1172.24s)]
*  Then the Trump regime, on top of that, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1174.12s)]
*  they want to go after student loan debt delinquencies. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1175.8s)]
*  And now we're seeing student loan debt delinquencies the highest ever, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1178.96s)]
*  which means that as people who can pay back their student loans, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  if their credit's getting harmed, then they're not going to be able to [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1186.32s)]
*  participate in paying back other types of loans. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1189.8s)]
*  That's going to be a shock to the system. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1192.96s)]
*  Auto loan delinquencies are at an all time high. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1195.32s)]
*  And so the question, I'm following all [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1198.24s)]
*  of these things because, you know, just one of these things, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1200.56s)]
*  as we saw with the housing crisis in, you know, 07-08 can have a spiral effect. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1203.76s)]
*  And we've created so many traps that is the self-inflicted traps that any one of [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1209.08s)]
*  these, you know, is an issue. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1216.2s)]
*  So it's why we're talking to you about it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1217.52s)]
*  We're trying to get ahead. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1219.08s)]
*  We're trying to explain what's happening with all the disinformation. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JnaHfwJSs&t=1219.76s)]
