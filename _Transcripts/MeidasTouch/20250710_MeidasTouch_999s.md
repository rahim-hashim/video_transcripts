# Trump PANICS on Thursday AM as he GETS CORNERED
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ)
*  Donald Trump is having a disastrous Thursday morning. He's off to his usual ranting and raving like a lunatic on social media. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But he also just announced a new ambassador he is appointing, the ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=7.92s)]
*  Someone named Nick Adams. I'll tell you more about Nick Adams in a moment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=14.92s)]
*  But the new United States ambassador to Malaysia says the following, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  When a woman is cooking dinner for me, this is how we split the responsibilities. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=23.48s)]
*  She cooks, I eat, she cleans, I head to Hooters, that's it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=27.8s)]
*  Or how about this one right here, pick up your Bible, get in your diesel powered truck, go to Hooters, they hate this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Or how about this, alpha males celebrate Valentine's Day by having a foursome at the country club and going out to Hooters with the boys. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=38.6s)]
*  This is the new United States ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=47.92s)]
*  The United States, it's not funny, every single day the United States is losing more and more credibility. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Yesterday we attacked Brazil saying that we were going to impose 50% tariffs unless they stop a criminal prosecution of Zaire Bolsonaro, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=58.36s)]
*  who led a coup against the current leadership in Brazil. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=69.16s)]
*  And Donald Trump continues to demean our allies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=73.72s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump posted this morning as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=77.48s)]
*  He goes, too late, that's how he refers to the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=80.2s)]
*  because we have a little petulant toddler in the White House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=86.92s)]
*  And again, no offense to petulant toddlers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=89.96s)]
*  He goes, too late demeans the great credit of the USA. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=92.28s)]
*  We are now again the number one credit in the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Gigantic comeback. The Fed rate should be reflective of this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=98.96s)]
*  Lower the rate! [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Then Donald Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=105.28s)]
*  By the way, the fundamentals of our economy are not strong at all right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Inflation is up. As you know, housing is less affordable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  And things are much worse than they were before Donald Trump took office. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=115.64s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posts the following from the great Greg Jarrett. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  It's clear Trump was framed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  The collusion narrative was a conspiracy itself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  The collaborators knew it was a lie, but they manipulated the dossier and the CIA to peddle their fairy tale. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=129.2s)]
*  Brennan and Comey manipulated the system and the documents itself. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=135.32s)]
*  They abused their power. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=138.44s)]
*  Comey launched a case against Trump in violation of FBI regulations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=139.64s)]
*  He deceived the FISA court with the dossier to gain a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=143.76s)]
*  These are the rantings and ravings of a lunatic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=147.92s)]
*  This is like a 51-50 hold needs to be placed on Donald Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=151.04s)]
*  What are we in? July 10th, 2025. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=155.04s)]
*  And Donald Trump is whining about James Comey and John Brennan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=158.24s)]
*  But you know what he's doing here, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=162.56s)]
*  He is distracting from the fact that he's not releasing the Epstein files or claiming that the Epstein files no longer exist. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  And he just wants us to look the other way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Oh, the new one. Have we told you about Russia, Russia, Russia again? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=174.96s)]
*  Remember, remember that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's play our greatest hits, by the way, all throughout the morning, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=180.56s)]
*  Donald Trump continued to post stuff like this in a blockbuster report. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=183.6s)]
*  The CIA has belatedly exposed the rank corruption amongst intelligence officials. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald, every day, currently, right now, you're colluding with Russia in public, in plain view. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=192.64s)]
*  I don't need to see secret texts or dossiers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=198.96s)]
*  I can literally watch and observe what you're doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=202.56s)]
*  You are withholding weapons from Ukraine and stringing them along. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=205.84s)]
*  Maybe I'll give it. Maybe I won't give it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=209.36s)]
*  I saw what you did with Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=211.28s)]
*  And I see how you treat Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=214.96s)]
*  And Putin's out there saying, oh, Donald and I spoke about cultural exchanges and we're going to make movies and musicals together. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=217.44s)]
*  And you don't deny that. That's collusion right there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=224.16s)]
*  I see it in plain view. I don't need secret text messages. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=226.64s)]
*  As I mentioned at the outset of this video, Donald Trump has nominated Nick Adams of Florida to be an ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=230.56s)]
*  Adams is from Australia. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  And I shared with you some of his posts at the outset. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=244.72s)]
*  Here's the types of videos that Adams would post about himself or he would post. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  He would like go in front of like the Anheuser-Busch factory and say, I'm an alpha male. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=254.48s)]
*  I'm an alpha male. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=259.84s)]
*  And this is very bad for the alpha male community. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=261.2s)]
*  Here, just watch this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=265.68s)]
*  This was recorded April 3rd, 2023. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=266.48s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=269.76s)]
*  And just so you think I'm not making this up, I mean, you saw the official press release. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=299.84s)]
*  And here is Nick Adams video saying that he is so proud to be now the United States ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=306.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  I just want you to think about the country of Malaysia, the surrounding countries in that region. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=329.76s)]
*  Just what kind of message this is sending. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=348.64s)]
*  How unserious of a country the United States is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=352.8s)]
*  What? Are we a prankster country? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=355.84s)]
*  Is that what we're reduced to? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=358.64s)]
*  Much worse than that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=361.36s)]
*  If you were going to take the steps to try to humiliate the United States of America on the world stage, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  and you were to say, what is the most embarrassing and humiliating things you can do? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=369.2s)]
*  It would be everything that Donald Trump did, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=373.68s)]
*  Saying that you want to take over Canada and turn it into the 51st state. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  That you want to conquer Greenland. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=380.32s)]
*  And no matter what, you're going to annex Greenland. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=383.12s)]
*  Attacking the NATO allies, supporting Vladimir Putin, going after, tariffing the world, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=386.4s)]
*  allowing alliances to form outside of the United States. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  Whereas the United States once brought together Japan, South Korea. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=400.08s)]
*  Now you see China, South Korea, and Japan having minister-level meetings. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=404.88s)]
*  And now we have Nick Adams, everybody, as the ambassador of Malaysia. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  How utterly embarrassing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=413.12s)]
*  This morning as well, Donald Trump woke up to some bad news. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=414.88s)]
*  A federal judge in New Hampshire issued a class action nationwide injunction [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=417.84s)]
*  blocking Donald Trump's ban on birthright citizenship. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=424.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=428.24s)]
*  Judge Joseph LaPlante, after the Supreme Court ruled that you can't order nationwide injunctions [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=429.28s)]
*  on anything unless there's a class action that is brought. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=437.12s)]
*  And unless a class action is certified, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=440.88s)]
*  the federal judge in New Hampshire said that there is a class, a group of people, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=443.52s)]
*  current babies who have just been born. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=448.96s)]
*  That's the class. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=450.96s)]
*  It's made up of current babies who can now be forced to lose their citizenship [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=452.08s)]
*  based on Donald Trump's executive order. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=457.68s)]
*  And that's what the Supreme Court basically said. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=460.32s)]
*  Okay, you can't have nationwide injunctions unless you have a class. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=462.64s)]
*  It has to be a well-defined class. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=465.84s)]
*  Well, the well-defined class is those who are impacted by this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=467.52s)]
*  The all of the new babies who were born here who are no longer, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=471.36s)]
*  I guess, viewed as citizens under the executive order. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  So the birthright citizenship order is an executive order by Donald Trump, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  which violates the Constitution. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=482.08s)]
*  And you can't do executive orders in violation of the Constitution. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=483.68s)]
*  It's currently paused. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=488.88s)]
*  That'll work its way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=490.08s)]
*  Just some other economic data to report for you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=492.64s)]
*  Warehouse vacancies climbed to the highest level in more than a decade. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=495.68s)]
*  This is the second quarter vacancy rate of 7.1 percent, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=500.16s)]
*  as reported by Cushman Wakefield was up from 6.1 percent a year earlier. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  More U.S. warehouse space is vacant than at any time in the past 11 years, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=509.36s)]
*  as companies hold off leasing new space amid rapidly changing trade policies. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=514.4s)]
*  Some other consumer signals. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=520.32s)]
*  Delta quarter two main cabin bookings down 5 percent. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=522.32s)]
*  Costco June comps run a bit light. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=526.48s)]
*  Amazon preliminary primed salesday data down 41 percent. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=529.36s)]
*  Bank of America says lower income households are spending growth is particularly soft, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=534.96s)]
*  with their total card spending growth negative year over year. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=539.92s)]

*  It's always interesting to see how the Magas are trying to spin [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump claiming the Epstein list no longer exists. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=626.32s)]
*  Remember this lady, Annapolina Luna, the MAGA Republican congresswoman, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=629.44s)]
*  whose real name actually is Annapolina Luna. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  She's got kind of that like George Santos, very suspicious background kind of thing going like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  where is she from? What's her real name? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=643.36s)]
*  Who is she really? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=645.76s)]
*  Anyway, she went on the Benny Johnson show and she was asked about the Epstein list [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=648.24s)]
*  because she ran like the Epstein list caucus. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  This was like one of her main issues. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=655.6s)]
*  And she's like, you know what? I don't really care anymore. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't really think Trump's on it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=660.96s)]
*  If Trump was on the list, wouldn't they have released it during the campaign? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=668.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=669.6s)]
*  I think that it needs to happen. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=670.72s)]
*  And so we'll continue to push for that list all forth, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  but it's been deafening how many members of Congress have been silent on this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=675.12s)]
*  And to be clear, also, I want to clear something up. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=678.64s)]
*  I do not think, and I've told this to multiple media outlets because I've been getting [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=681.36s)]
*  questions on this, is Trump on the Epstein list? No. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=685.28s)]
*  And I'm very positive that because if he was, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=689.04s)]
*  they would have released it during the election cycle. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=691.76s)]
*  But what I do know and what I'm seeing right now across every aspect, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=694.64s)]
*  whether it's rich or famous, not famous people have actual concerns. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=699.44s)]
*  Are people basically paying off people to be quiet? And that's not OK. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=704.08s)]
*  And that's the thing with these Trump regime people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=709.84s)]
*  At the end of the day, they will always twist and contort themselves [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  into whatever daddy Trump wants of them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=717.2s)]
*  I think that's what they call them right now, right? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=719.6s)]
*  More data we're getting. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=722.0s)]
*  I did a whole report on this yesterday, hat tip for CNN for getting the first scoop on this. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  How FEMA's response to Texas flood was slowed by Kristi Noem's cost cutting efforts. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=728.56s)]
*  Anything that cost above hundred thousand dollars needed her personal sign off. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  And it took her more than 72 hours to sign off on the urban search and rescue teams. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=740.4799999999999s)]
*  72 hours before the urban search and rescue teams were signed off on. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=747.1199999999999s)]
*  And here she is on Fox saying, oh, it's just a bunch of fake CNN, fake news, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=752.64s)]
*  fake news, fake news, fake news. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=758.08s)]
*  Well, why don't you address the reality? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=759.44s)]
*  Did you sign off on the urban search and rescue teams right away or did it take you 72 hours? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=762.0s)]
*  But no, fake news, fake news. Here's what she says. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=768.72s)]
*  That point, do you CNN is basically you've got a report accusing you of slowing the process. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=771.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=776.32s)]
*  Would you like to respond to that? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=776.82s)]
*  Well, there you go. Fake news. CNN again, is absolutely trash what they are doing by saying [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=777.76s)]
*  that because our Coast Guard, our Border Patrol, BORTC teams were there immediately. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=782.96s)]
*  Every single thing I was on, they asked for, we were there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=787.92s)]
*  The governor and the emergency management director, Nim Kidd are fantastic. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=791.76s)]
*  And nobody there has said anything about that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=796.8s)]
*  They didn't get everything that they wanted immediately or that they needed. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=800.64s)]
*  And I'm proud of the work that we've done to support that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=804.32s)]
*  But, you know, we've got flooding going on in New Mexico as well, North Carolina. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  So I've been visiting with their leadership team and spent quite a bit of time on the phone [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=810.16s)]
*  yesterday with the New Mexico governor, getting them resources as well. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=814.4s)]
*  And that's what we do. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=818.88s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that CNN is continuing to be political and push out fake information and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=820.48s)]
*  false information and lies is not shocking, but it's a disservice to the country. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=827.36s)]
*  It's a real disservice to the country because people start to mistrust [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=833.36s)]
*  anything that comes out then over the news. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=837.12s)]
*  Start? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=838.88s)]
*  And then, well, that's true. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=839.52s)]
*  But they just don't trust anybody anymore. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's not the kind of country. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=844.4s)]
*  Certainly we are praying. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  New York Times is also reporting how camp mystics' cabins were so close to the river's edge [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  that they were considered part of the river's floodway, a corridor of such extreme hazard [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=853.52s)]
*  that many states and counties ban or severely restrict construction in these types of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=859.52s)]
*  floodway corridor areas. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=865.76s)]
*  But that's where they put the camp. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=867.52s)]
*  So just think about all levels of government breakdown here, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  because at the federal level, the Trump regime wants to destroy government. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=872.88s)]
*  At the state level, Texas wants to destroy government. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=876.96s)]
*  At the local level, at Kerr County and at Kerrville, I've showed you countless videos [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=880.48s)]
*  of the sheriffs, of the judge who leads the county, of the mayor of Kerrville. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  You've seen Governor Abbott, we don't want to talk about this. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=890.24s)]
*  We're not talking. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=893.04s)]
*  Stop blaming. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=893.84s)]
*  We need to pray. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=894.4s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  We need to pray. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=896.24s)]
*  Why would we need alert systems? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=896.72s)]
*  Why would we need? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=898.16s)]
*  There was no warning systems. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=898.88s)]
*  There was like limited to no communication between the feds and the states. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=901.12s)]
*  You put the kids right in the flood corridor. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=905.28s)]
*  This is what happens when you just try to act like government shouldn't do it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=908.56s)]
*  Ah, too much regulation. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=912.16s)]
*  Why would we want any of that? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=913.52s)]
*  No, you need to. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  There is a role sometimes for government. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  Finally, I want to share this with you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=918.0s)]
*  This is from, I'll give you some good news, from the AFL-CIO bus tour. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=919.92s)]

*  The answer is not a political party here in Washington, DC. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=945.04s)]
*  The answer is not more of the broken status quo. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=948.88s)]
*  The answer is a good union job. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Jm1E8-LuQ&t=953.8399999999999s)]
