Video Description: In this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast, we expose the chaos Trump is causing across the economy and political landscape. As U.S. ports face critical shortages, Trump is busy touting fake trade deals that don’t actually exist. Meanwhile, he’s being accused of market manipulation schemes that could land anyone else behind bars. The Fed keeps interest rates steady and warns that stagflation may be around the corner, thanks to Trump’s reckless trade war. Plus: Trump loyalist Kash Patel is grilled by Democrats, GOP Senators call Trump’s massive spending bill dead on arrival, and history is made with the election of an American Pope—whose past anti-Trump posts are now going viral. Ben, Brett and Jordy discuss all this and more!

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 5/8/25
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw)
*  Donald Trump announced a fake deal with the United Kingdom today where essentially Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=0.0s)]
*  partially removed tariffs that he put in place in early April and he's calling that a deal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=6.8s)]
*  while trying to manipulate the markets and telling people, I don't know, something good [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=12.76s)]
*  may happen with China. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=17.12s)]
*  You may want to start to buy stock right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=18.32s)]
*  We've seen this game with Donald Trump before, but let's face it, mainstream, real people [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=21.36s)]
*  are suffering right now unless you're in the 1% or the 1% of 1% inflations on the rise again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=26.8s)]
*  The trade deficits are actually getting larger. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  Our economy is shrinking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=37.92s)]
*  We'll talk about that on this episode. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=39.92s)]
*  Also, a new pope was selected. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  The first ever American pope now named Leo XIV, who was previously a cardinal in Chicago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=44.56s)]
*  One of the interesting data points is that the new pope had previously made lots of posts, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=53.9s)]
*  very critical of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=59.58s)]
*  Also, a bishop who was part of Donald Trump's Committee on Religion had made a statement [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=62.58s)]
*  that he does not expect there ever to be an American pope unless the power of America [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  is in decline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=74.78s)]
*  If an American pope were to ever be appointed, it would demonstrate the view by the Vatican [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=76.42s)]
*  that America is in decline. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=81.66s)]
*  You can ask yourself if that's a correlation, but this bishop who's part of Donald Trump's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=83.86s)]
*  religious council is the person who made that statement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=87.86s)]
*  Also, the MAGA Republicans at war with each other over the reconciliation of the budget. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  You've got a lot of MAGA Republicans who want to gut Medicaid. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=98.22s)]
*  Others are worried about the optics of gutting Medicaid and how that could impact their election [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=102.02s)]
*  in the midterm. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=107.44s)]
*  They're calling this a big, beautiful bill because Donald Trump's making them call it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=108.58s)]
*  but it is a big, massive disaster and already MAGA Republicans in the Senate like Ron Johnson [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  from Wisconsin are already saying there's no chance that a reconciliation along the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=118.62s)]
*  lines of what the MAGA Republicans in the House are doing will ever pass the Senate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=123.9s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll talk about a lot more. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump saying, little girls, you get one pencil, one doll and shut up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump regime central planning is telling you what you can buy and not buy while Donald [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=138.9s)]
*  Trump is getting ready for a trip to the Middle East to meet with countries whose sovereign [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=144.22s)]
*  wealth funds have put literally what, $4 billion in Donald Trump's pocket in the past 100 days, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=148.62s)]
*  whether it's a resort deal with Qatar, Abu Dhabi using Trump crypto, Saudi Arabia having [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=155.26s)]
*  Trump resorts in Oman and more. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=161.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's family is the only person benefiting off of all of these, what I like to refer [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=164.14s)]
*  to as the rug pull Ponzi scheme presidency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=170.44s)]
*  Let's bring in Brett and Jordy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=172.94s)]
*  Guys, how are you doing, brothers? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=174.66s)]
*  Doing well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=177.26s)]
*  Trying to make sense of this all, Ben. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=178.26s)]
*  Jordy, good to see you guys. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=179.26s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  Midas, Midy, everybody watching here on YouTube, everybody listening on Apple Podcast, Spotify, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  wherever you get podcasts, make sure to add the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=185.1s)]
*  Another day, another day of chaos as always with Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=189.06s)]
*  I like how these Republicans are always concerned about the optics. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  What if this looks, what if it looks bad that we're taking away people's health care? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=195.66s)]
*  How about don't be so concerned about the optics and be concerned about the fact that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=198.86s)]
*  you're actually trying to take away people's health care. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  How about we start there and not with how is this going to look to people because it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=204.9s)]
*  looks pretty bad because it is pretty bad. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=209.82s)]
*  And Trump now kind of just encouraging these shortages, saying that we're going to have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  to learn to live with less, that girls are going to have to have less dolls, fewer dolls. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=216.3s)]
*  What's his obsession with dolls anyway? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=220.82s)]
*  Everything's about to get more expensive. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=222.9s)]
*  There are about to be shortages of every single product under the sun. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=224.98s)]
*  And Donald Trump just continues to sit there, manipulate the markets, do his same scheme [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=228.54s)]
*  and honestly sound like a communist dictator the way he speaks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=232.86s)]
*  Like Trump is like full on commie right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=236.34s)]
*  The statements coming out of his mouth are what we've heard from communist regimes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=238.86s)]
*  throughout history. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=243.38s)]
*  Now it's coming from an American president. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=244.38s)]
*  And the irony of the party who's always calling everything communist, the irony of the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=246.58s)]
*  irony of that coming from them is just very apparent to me, I would say. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=250.74s)]
*  Anyway, good to be here with you guys. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Jordy, what's the latest on your end? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=257.06s)]
*  Excited to get into the show before I toss it over to Benji. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=258.54s)]
*  I know everyone's on the edge of their seats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=261.5s)]
*  Yes, I do finally have power back after eight days. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=263.22s)]
*  So super excited again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=266.82s)]
*  Shout out, Western PA, man. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=268.54s)]
*  Us Yinzers, man, we're we're different. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=270.3s)]
*  We're different, Bri. We're tough. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=272.14s)]
*  We're tough out here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  Benji, where do you want to start? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=274.62s)]
*  I was speaking at this conference this past week, and one of the things I was asked is, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  what do you think resonates about the Midas Touch Network to your audience? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=281.62s)]
*  And I said, we try to just break through, break things down, not at a political level, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=285.38000000000005s)]
*  but just kind of basic common sense when it comes to people and facts and data. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  And we try to come with receipts and we try to come with common sense. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  So we all know that when the ships are not arriving at ports in the United States, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=301.9s)]
*  that's a bad thing, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  The ships are supposed to come in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  We're supposed to have healthy trading relationships. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=313.14s)]
*  So to me, when Donald Trump is out there holding press conferences and he's asked the most [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=316.26s)]
*  basic of questions, are you concerned that ships are not coming into, say, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=321.06s)]
*  the port of Seattle or the port of Long Beach in Los Angeles or ports in Boston? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=327.62s)]
*  Or does that concern you that these shipping volumes are down significantly? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=333.02s)]
*  Isn't that going to result in scarcity and supply shortages? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=337.9s)]
*  And it's a lagging indicator. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  But does that worry you? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=344.58s)]
*  And when Donald Trump's response is, no, I think it's a great thing because that means [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=346.26s)]
*  we lose less money. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  You think about that and you go, that makes no sense right there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=354.46s)]
*  So we can't normalize statements like this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=358.18s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said earlier. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=360.54s)]
*  To that extent, let's play it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=362.5s)]
*  Because business has slowed down, as you mentioned, we're seeing, but we're seeing as a result, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=364.06s)]
*  the ports here in the US, the traffic has really slowed and now thousands of dock workers [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=371.02s)]
*  and truck drivers are worried about their jobs. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=376.98s)]
*  Is that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=379.82s)]
*  That means we lose less money. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=380.54s)]
*  When I see that, that means we lose less money. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=382.46s)]
*  Look, Chad. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=384.29999999999995s)]
*  When I see that, that means we lose less money. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=385.82s)]
*  We lose less money. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=390.14s)]
*  It means we lose more jobs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=390.94s)]
*  It means we lose trucking jobs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=392.82s)]
*  It means we lose the jobs of longshoremen and longshorewoman. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=394.9s)]
*  It means that the products are not getting on the shelves. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=398.74s)]
*  It means Americans can't access goods. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=402.5s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  That's causing harm to the economy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=406.38s)]
*  And by the way, the trade deficit is at record highs right now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=409.06s)]
*  So if this whole thing was, well, we need to reduce the trade deficit because America's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=414.5s)]
*  getting screwed over, it's had the exact opposite effect as American companies have scrambled [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=418.7s)]
*  to try to import as much as possible before the supply chain completely breaks down. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=425.5s)]
*  So that's what we're showing to our audio listeners, just so you know. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a headline from Newsmax. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=434.9s)]
*  Don't get much more right wing than Newsmax. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=437.06s)]
*  U.S. trade deficit surges 14% to record high of $140.5 billion. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  And then you take a look not just at the trade deficit, but our overall budget deficits here [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=445.82s)]
*  in the United States, and you look at the GOP budget, that is going to explode the deficit [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=450.29999999999995s)]
*  by trillions and trillions of dollars. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=456.26s)]
*  Like at a bare minimum, like $3 to $5 trillion just on this alone. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=458.74s)]
*  I think it's going to be more like $15 to $25 or even more trillion dollars because [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=463.26000000000005s)]
*  the Trump regime's basically fired all of the IRS auditors and they've gutted it to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  the point where I don't think we're going to be able to effectively collect tax revenue [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=474.5s)]
*  the way we did before. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  But while that's going on, here's what Donald Trump was doing at the same press conference. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=480.82000000000005s)]
*  And again, he's using his position in the Oval Office, and he's also using state regime [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  media known as Fox because the Chiron, did you all notice what the Chiron said there? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=491.46s)]
*  It said, Trump going to have a good weekend with China. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  That's what it said on the prior Chiron. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=501.38s)]
*  And this is all arranged together. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=503.62s)]
*  Regime media works basically Fox, Trump, they're basically the same, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=505.7s)]
*  Jeanine Pirro, for example, from Fox, she's being looked at right now to be the next [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=510.82s)]
*  United States attorney from Washington, D.C. after the Trump regime dropped that Ed Martin [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=515.62s)]
*  guy after at least one MAGA Republican, Tom Tillis from North Carolina, said they wouldn't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=520.58s)]
*  approve Ed Martin because he supported January 6th insurrectionists too much. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=524.82s)]
*  There's a little bit of support for J-6, which is okay, but it's too much for the MAGA Republican [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=529.7s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=534.34s)]
*  But here what Donald Trump then does with this press conference where he's announcing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=535.34s)]
*  this fake UK trade deal is he goes and tells people, you better buy stock, you better buy [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=538.82s)]
*  stock. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  And he combines that with using the term Palestinian as a slur to attack a Jewish Senator, Chuck [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=544.78s)]
*  Schumer. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  Here, watch this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  You better go out and buy stock now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you, this country will be like a rocket ship that goes straight up. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=557.1s)]
*  This is going to be numbers that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=562.54s)]
*  That's a very important element of all of this. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=566.3s)]
*  You know, if we get that, if you don't, and the Democrats are fighting it only because [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=567.98s)]
*  they want to fight. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=572.3s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome, you know, if it was somebody else, they wouldn't fight. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=573.3s)]
*  If you had a normal person, if you had some stiff sitting behind you, they'd be fine. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=576.66s)]
*  But they have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=582.42s)]
*  You know, Senator Schumer's become a Palestinian. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=584.14s)]
*  I don't know whether they're going to give him the ceremony, whatever the ceremony may [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=587.14s)]
*  be. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=593.14s)]
*  It's terrible what's happened to the Democrats. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=594.14s)]
*  So very, very important element of everything, of what we're doing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=596.14s)]
*  One related to today, but related in the sense that we'll do if that passes, we'll do even [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=602.22s)]
*  more business with the UK. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=607.1s)]
*  We'll have so much. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=608.82s)]
*  All UK trade is under 2% with the United States. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=612.1s)]
*  Number two, the person laughing in the background there at what was just not funny at all was [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=617.52s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Nutlick. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=623.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, Howard Lutnick. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=625.62s)]
*  And you heard him laughing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh, he called him a Palestinian. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=628.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's not funny. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=632.18s)]
*  Number two, number three, when you talk about this UK trade deal that they announced, again, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=635.78s)]
*  it's another part of the Ponzi scheme. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=641.78s)]
*  It's not a trade deal. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=644.06s)]
*  So any corporate news that refers to this as a trade deal, it is not that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=646.1s)]
*  First off, trade deals need to be approved by Congress, number one. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=650.9s)]
*  Number two, Donald Trump declared an emergency, essentially war, against the UK and every [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=654.98s)]
*  country to impose emergency tariffs, which Trump never had the ability to do. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=661.94s)]
*  He then reduced some tariffs on like Range Rovers and Land Rovers from the UK, basically [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=667.38s)]
*  from like 20% or 25% to 10%. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=674.58s)]
*  And then they kind of encouraged the UK to buy American beef, which there's no guarantee [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=678.94s)]
*  of. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=683.5s)]
*  That's what they're calling a deal. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=684.7s)]
*  That's not a trade deal. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=686.5s)]
*  Is that one of what Treasury Secretary Scott Besson calls a sub deal? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=689.22s)]
*  This is not a deal that took place. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=694.26s)]
*  Trump created a fire. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=696.42s)]
*  He's the arsonist. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=699.1s)]
*  He then tries to he doesn't even try to put it out. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=701.02s)]
*  He pretends he shows up with a hose, doesn't even put the fire out. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=703.94s)]
*  And then he just says, hey, everybody, I put the fire out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=708.46s)]
*  Look what I did with the UK. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=711.3s)]
*  And then goes and says, you better buy stock now so that the market goes up on that, because [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=713.9s)]
*  the past times Donald Trump has said that he's announced something where he can move [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=719.98s)]
*  the markets up and then the markets go down. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=724.9s)]
*  You need to understand those systemically, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=727.7s)]
*  What's happening with our economy? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=730.74s)]
*  What it means when the GDP is shrinking, what it means when mortgage rates are now 6.9 or [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=733.42s)]
*  7% and housing is less affordable, not more affordable and inflation is on the rise. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=737.98s)]
*  I mean, you take a look at what Goldman Sachs, not exactly a lefty organization, Goldman [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=744.14s)]
*  Sachs, you take a look at what Ken Griffin, the head of Citadel, saying what Mark Rowan, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=750.18s)]
*  the head of Apollo Global is saying. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=755.9s)]
*  You take a look at these, you know, you know, Republican donors and and Republican business [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=759.1s)]
*  leaders. They're saying that Trump has destroyed the brand of America. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=764.9s)]
*  Basically, the value of the dollar has essentially been irreparably tainted. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=769.6600000000001s)]
*  Our bond market has been irreparably tainted and the impacts are going to be felt for for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=774.3800000000001s)]
*  generations. And then you see the day to day market volatility. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=780.5400000000001s)]
*  And again, it just looks like the Trump meme coin, our stock market. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  And who's going to get screwed? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=790.1400000000001s)]
*  Not Trump, because he's getting Qatari money and Saudi Arabian money and Abu Dhabi money. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=791.7800000000001s)]
*  You're going to get screwed and you being the global you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=797.82s)]
*  Anyone who doesn't have private jets and yachts and people, including Trump supporters, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=803.38s)]
*  they're going to get screwed. Breton Jordan, those wokesters at Goldman Sachs, classic [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=809.0600000000001s)]
*  woke lib Goldman Sachs, woke wokeman Sachs, I think is what they're calling them now. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=813.6600000000001s)]
*  Wokedale, Wokalo. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=818.7800000000001s)]
*  And now that's one doesn't quite work. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=821.26s)]
*  It was Apollo with woke before it didn't really. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=823.26s)]
*  It's a good job. Sometimes sometimes you got to shoot your shot once every few, you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=826.46s)]
*  know, you connect. Yeah, this was totally embarrassing. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=832.1800000000001s)]
*  And Trump held it as this was going to be some sort of major trade deal last night. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=835.02s)]
*  One of his classic all caps tweets. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=839.58s)]
*  We did it, everybody. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=842.02s)]
*  It's like, what did you do? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=843.46s)]
*  First off, once it came out that it was the United Kingdom, I couldn't help but laugh [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=845.1s)]
*  because we actually have a trade surplus with the United Kingdom, which the whole point [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=848.5400000000001s)]
*  of this is for the trade deficit. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=852.46s)]
*  So it doesn't even make sense to begin with. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=853.62s)]
*  Of course, you're going to cut the deal with the one that we have the surplus with [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=855.18s)]
*  because your tariffs by your own admission of the reasoning that you're saying these [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  tariffs are being placed doesn't make any sense with the nation that we have a trade [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=862.7399999999999s)]
*  surplus on. And even with that, they couldn't even get to an actual deal. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=866.42s)]
*  It's a concept of a deal that we are working on right here. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=870.6999999999999s)]
*  And just like everything they do is just a scam from start to finish. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  And quite frankly, I wish that there were a lot of aspects of this that could work. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=879.26s)]
*  I wish that Doge was actually an organization that was going in to improve the technology [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=883.46s)]
*  of government, increase the efficiency of government. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=889.34s)]
*  But then I wish maybe they actually could actually lower the deficit or balance the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=892.14s)]
*  budget. The fact is, when they actually come into office, they complain about all that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=896.14s)]
*  crap and then they do the opposite and they do it far worse than any of their major [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  complaints like Donald Trump is going to explode the deficit once again, way more than [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=905.0600000000001s)]
*  what the deficit or debt went up under Joe Biden, which was actually decreasing under [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden, the deficit you see with this whole Doge nonsense, Trump at that or Elon [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=913.2199999999999s)]
*  Musk was promising over two trillion dollars in cuts. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=919.5s)]
*  Right. We're going to have two trillion dollars in cuts to the government. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=922.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, Judd Lagum did a report yesterday showing that Elon Musk is now on track to deliver [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=925.9399999999999s)]
*  just five billion dollars worth of cuts, so point to five percent of the promised [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=930.8199999999999s)]
*  cuts. And that's him being generous to get to that number. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=936.3s)]
*  And not only that, that doesn't take into account the amount that Doge is actually [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=939.8599999999999s)]
*  costing us, as Ben mentioned before, by Doge's actions in the IRS alone, it is [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=944.54s)]
*  going to cost the U.S. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=951.06s)]
*  more than one trillion dollars. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=952.9s)]
*  I think some of the estimates are one point six, one point seven trillion dollars in [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=954.9s)]
*  costs to the United States. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=959.4599999999999s)]
*  So Elon Musk said that he was going to save the federal government two trillion [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=961.3s)]
*  dollars. In fact, he is costing the federal government at least that amount and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=965.8599999999999s)]
*  probably more while also causing chaos, while also causing mass unemployment, while [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=971.14s)]
*  also just disrupting people's lives. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=976.02s)]
*  The trauma that comes with all this, the collective trauma that we are all [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=978.66s)]
*  experiencing here as Americans, it's just one scam after the next scam after the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=981.9799999999999s)]
*  next scam with nothing actually getting done. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=986.9799999999999s)]
*  And that's why we see when these Republicans actually have to do something or [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=990.1s)]
*  when Donald Trump actually has to do something like, OK, fellas, it's time to [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=994.46s)]
*  pass a budget. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=998.34s)]
*  This is your most basic of tasks. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=999.4200000000001s)]
*  You got to just pass a budget. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1001.58s)]
*  This is what every Congress and president needs to do each year. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1003.14s)]
*  Right. They cannot even do the most basic tasks of governing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1006.0600000000001s)]
*  That's why they're so focused on let's rename the Persian Sea or let's [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1010.26s)]
*  rename the Gulf of America, Mexico, the Gulf of America. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1015.82s)]
*  The Persian Gulf, they want to call it the Arabian Gulf. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1019.38s)]
*  Like that. Yeah. So this is this is that's all they could do because they could only [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1022.06s)]
*  handle the performative crap. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1026.98s)]
*  And they're not even that good at that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1028.66s)]
*  Like even when you look at I know I'm covering a lot right now, but even when you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1030.46s)]
*  look at deportations, Trump's deportation numbers, despite all the chaos, despite [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1033.34s)]
*  all of his illegal actions, despite him deporting people, kidnapping people, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1038.74s)]
*  abducting them, disappearing them, sending them to these death camps, these [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1042.94s)]
*  concentration camps, he's actually deporting fewer people than Joe Biden did [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1046.46s)]
*  than Barack Obama did. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1050.66s)]
*  Like, how could you be so evil, yet so incompetent at the same time? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1052.14s)]
*  But that is the name of the game with the Trump administration. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1056.58s)]
*  Right. You talk about this collective trauma that we're all going through. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1060.02s)]
*  And I just want to say that that that's exactly what it is. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1063.42s)]
*  Like, you're so right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1066.54s)]
*  It's just so deeply pathetic watching Trump field these questions. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1067.8600000000001s)]
*  He's barely getting out sentences as he's responding. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1072.58s)]
*  But is corporate media going to push back on that and say, hey, are you cognitively [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1075.82s)]
*  all there? I don't know if they will. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1079.46s)]
*  But we certainly will hear. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1080.82s)]
*  And you got Nutlick in the background just chuckling it up. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1082.98s)]
*  Like, it's all just so honestly dystopian. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1085.58s)]
*  And like what in the North Korea are we watching? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1088.1799999999998s)]
*  Wasn't that just so embarrassing to watch to the way he was laughing? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1090.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a fake laugh. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1096.5s)]
*  It's like it's it's like Austin Powers when like the people around Dr. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1097.82s)]
*  Evil are like, yes, it's so funny that you were saying I was [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1101.46s)]
*  thinking of an analogy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1105.7s)]
*  That's exactly what that is. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1107.82s)]
*  Is the doctor evil when they're all around the circular chill like, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1108.94s)]
*  like the extended. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1113.14s)]
*  But but but but it hurts. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1114.06s)]
*  Like, I wish it was funny, but it like genuinely hurts me as someone who [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1115.5800000000002s)]
*  deeply loves this country. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  And I know the might is mighty in this pro democracy community. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1120.74s)]
*  Like, it hurts you, too. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1123.38s)]
*  Like you see these losers up there, these completely incompetent fools who are just [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1124.6200000000001s)]
*  destroying the country that we love and and they're laughing about it on their way. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1128.98s)]
*  And they just look so evil and manipulative. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1133.7s)]
*  And it's just also pathetic. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1135.66s)]
*  You know, and it's like whack them all. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1137.82s)]
*  There are so many things you kind of have to cover like at the same time. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1139.3400000000001s)]
*  They're like destroying museums in the United States, like they're like getting [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1142.26s)]
*  rid of artifacts from the African-American History Museum, the Smithsonian. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1146.46s)]
*  They're going after the Japanese American Museum in Los Angeles and also museums [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1150.82s)]
*  like that across the country that celebrate diversity and inclusion of [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1155.9s)]
*  other ethnicities and other cultures. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1161.86s)]
*  They're getting shut down and like attorney generals across the country have to like [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1164.02s)]
*  file lawsuits to protect museums. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1167.46s)]
*  You know, one of the things that they're doing, too, I know we have a lot of [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1169.94s)]
*  supporters from Sweden here and the might is mighty. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1173.86s)]
*  So like this doesn't even get enough attention. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1176.78s)]
*  So the U.S. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1179.46s)]
*  Embassy in Stockholm in Sweden is demanding that Stockholm itself, that the city [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1180.34s)]
*  stop all diversity and inclusion initiatives. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1188.34s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1191.54s)]
*  Embassy is making an order to Sweden through the U.S. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1192.42s)]
*  Embassy that they don't support Sweden doing diversity and inclusion. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1196.74s)]
*  And it just goes to show you like I can go to different countries, but just think [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1200.5s)]
*  about what the people in Sweden are thinking. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1205.82s)]
*  Like the U.S. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1207.3s)]
*  Embassy is telling us in Sweden that we can't support diversity here. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1208.58s)]
*  Like, who are you? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1213.42s)]
*  Like, no, we're going to we're going to do what we do. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1214.58s)]
*  In our country and Britain, you talk about the renaming of the Persian Gulf. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1217.94s)]
*  They want to call it the Arabian Gulf. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1221.78s)]
*  And by the way, you know, it probably went down like this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1223.22s)]
*  Trump was probably like on a call with MBS or or the Abu Dhabi fund or someone in [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1226.18s)]
*  advance. And you know, he was probably like, you know, you know, you know, which is [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1230.8999999999999s)]
*  like, you want to be funny. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1236.18s)]
*  Let me do that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1237.42s)]
*  I'm going to go out and go like go from America. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1238.42s)]
*  I'm going to do I'm going to call it the Arabian Gulf. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1241.26s)]
*  You know, and then be like, oh, no, you're not going to do it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1245.98s)]
*  I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1248.58s)]
*  You know, and like that's what our foreign policy has become. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1250.46s)]
*  But what it really abstracts and obscures is what we should be focusing on. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1254.18s)]
*  Right. Like what's going on in the Red Sea right now? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1258.34s)]
*  We've lost at least two F-18 Hornet jets. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1261.06s)]
*  Just fell off airplanes while the Houthis are attacking. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1265.3s)]
*  I think it's the USS Harry Truman that's that's that's out there. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1269.46s)]
*  We've lost at least what, seven or eight, but potentially more Reaper drones [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1273.54s)]
*  over Yemen. And this is as we're also aware that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1278.94s)]
*  Department of Defense and State Department are putting a lid. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1284.3s)]
*  They're preventing any information about U.S. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1287.86s)]
*  casualties in Yemen from even being reported on at all. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1290.58s)]
*  And we know that it was the communications about the Houthis and strike [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1295.4199999999998s)]
*  targets that were in the signal text threads between Mike [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1301.06s)]
*  Walls, the former national security adviser and Pete Hegseth, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1306.06s)]
*  the Department of Defense secretary. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1309.94s)]
*  And so do we have any trust or faith that the Trump regime [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1312.02s)]
*  is not covering up what the hell is going on? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1316.78s)]
*  Like, why are we losing a combined half a billion dollars [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1318.86s)]
*  to maybe a billion dollars in military equipment in the past 100 days? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1323.3s)]
*  Could you imagine if former President Biden lost nearly a billion dollars [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1328.46s)]
*  in military equipment in the in just the Red Sea? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1333.46s)]
*  And there's no explanation really for it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1337.9s)]
*  Oh, then the plane just fell off the ship. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1340.18s)]
*  The Reapers, they just got shot down in the past 100 days. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1342.9s)]
*  We're talking about. And I could tell you, they'd be blaming, you know, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1346.82s)]
*  D.I., they'd be blind. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1349.18s)]
*  Fine. They'd find some transgender person to pin this on because that's what they do. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  They'd be blaming some black person because that's what they do. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1354.46s)]
*  This is like the hearings they'd hold. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1358.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. There'd be hearings. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1359.9s)]
*  How could this happen? How this is wokeism? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1361.02s)]
*  This is D.I. I mean, you know, that would right. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1363.18s)]
*  What's up? They would go, you know, they would go up there and they would grandstand. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1365.0600000000002s)]
*  Right. They would go eight Reaper Jones drones. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1368.18s)]
*  They would go, you know, and they would make it a big deal. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1373.46s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1375.78s)]
*  And they would say just like right. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1377.98s)]
*  And then that would be on Fox treason, impeachment. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1379.7s)]
*  And and by the way, four Americans died in Lithuania. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1383.18s)]
*  Trump and the regime said nothing about it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1387.38s)]
*  Two American soldiers died in the border of New Mexico. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1389.74s)]
*  Nothing about it at all. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1394.7s)]
*  Like you said, you know, their strategy is the covid strategy, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1396.8600000000001s)]
*  which is you don't test. There are no cases. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1399.94s)]
*  And that's what they do in every single aspect. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1402.1000000000001s)]
*  And any time anything looks bad for them, they just don't talk about it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1404.5s)]
*  Or Trump says, I don't know anything about it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1407.8200000000002s)]
*  They don't report the actual facts. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1410.0200000000002s)]
*  The fact that we are like, let's face it, like we are at war in Yemen right now. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1411.6200000000001s)]
*  Like we are at war in the Red Sea with the Houthis. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1415.3799999999999s)]
*  And I know people don't want to call it that, but that is exactly what is going on. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1417.82s)]
*  And Trump's, you know, now claiming that there's some sort of ceasefire. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1422.58s)]
*  Well, there has to be a tax for there to be a ceasefire. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1425.4599999999998s)]
*  Like there's a ceasefire. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1428.3s)]
*  Everything's going great. We're saying it's a ceasefire. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1429.6599999999999s)]
*  But even after Donald Trump said that, that's like when a lot of these incidents [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1431.6999999999998s)]
*  continue to happen. And I believe and this is my speculation. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1434.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's backed up by facts, at least a little bit, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  that we're not getting the full picture of what's going on, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  because the Trump administration [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1444.62s)]
*  refuses to tell us what's actually going on in the Red Sea. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1446.1s)]
*  So when I hear these stories of these fighter jets that are mysteriously [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1449.1399999999999s)]
*  falling off the USS Harry S. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1453.26s)]
*  Truman, you know, I cannot help but think, did something else happen here? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1455.1399999999999s)]
*  Then this ship just happened to miss the landing or it just happened to fall off. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1459.6999999999998s)]
*  Like those stories just to me, they're not like quite checking out as, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1464.5s)]
*  oh, that makes sense. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1469.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a usual thing that happens. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1470.1s)]
*  There's planes just roll off aircraft carriers all the time. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1471.8999999999999s)]
*  And there's been like multiple, multiple instances just like this over the past [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1475.54s)]
*  few months, multiple instances. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1479.9799999999998s)]
*  And when you look at like, you know, what is Pete Hegseth saying [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1481.9799999999998s)]
*  while this is going on? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1485.06s)]
*  You see Pete Hegseth like yesterday, like when we were learning about some of this [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1486.9399999999998s)]
*  new stuff with the Houthis and we were learning about, you know, these wars [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1489.8999999999999s)]
*  breaking out between India and Pakistan. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1492.9799999999998s)]
*  You see Hegseth posting things like, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1496.6999999999998s)]
*  no more woke bullshit in my military. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  Kiss my ass. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1502.54s)]
*  And it's like, OK, talk tough all you want. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1503.6200000000001s)]
*  Like you're the worst. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1506.06s)]
*  You're completely incompetent. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1507.14s)]
*  Like our fighter jets are just being lost off of our aircraft carriers. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1509.3s)]
*  We're being attacked. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1515.3400000000001s)]
*  The world is on fire and you're complaining about wokeism. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1516.3s)]
*  Like get over yourself. Do your damn job. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1519.54s)]
*  You mean, right. You don't think we're getting accurate information from the slow [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1522.22s)]
*  the testing down guy. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1525.3400000000001s)]
*  You don't think he's given us up to date details on everything? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1527.1s)]
*  I'm going to say probably not. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1529.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you know, also Donald Trump said it's also really weird to to like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1530.86s)]
*  very quickly enter into like a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1535.2199999999998s)]
*  after talking so much shit. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1539.02s)]
*  Like, just think about it like you're the United States of America, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1540.86s)]
*  You're talking we're going to demolish it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1544.1399999999999s)]
*  We're going to do we're going to f them up. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1545.78s)]
*  I mean, right. They want everything. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1547.82s)]
*  And then eight Reaper drones go down. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1549.58s)]
*  We lose two F-18s. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1551.54s)]
*  And then Donald Trump said he's like, you know, they're very. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1553.02s)]
*  He called the Houthis honorable people in the press. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1555.7s)]
*  I guess the very honorable people. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1558.02s)]
*  We trust them. We're doing it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1559.58s)]
*  He was like, yeah, they took they took our hits very well. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1561.8999999999999s)]
*  They were quite brave out there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1564.62s)]
*  They're calling the Houthis brave. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1566.54s)]
*  Like, what are you doing, man? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1568.1399999999999s)]
*  Like you're the commander in chief act like it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1569.5s)]
*  And when we come back, I want to talk about this to break because you [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1571.86s)]
*  we've heard like a lot of topics. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1575.1399999999999s)]
*  Wow. You know, in a short period of time already. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1576.3799999999999s)]
*  But I want to bring this to because we've gone from real credible scientists, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1579.26s)]
*  people like Dr. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1584.42s)]
*  Fauci, who are out to now you have people who are in. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1585.42s)]
*  And Fauci wasn't the surgeon general. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1590.3000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, but but we had, you know, top doctors who used to be the surgeon [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1592.02s)]
*  general. But right now, for example, Trump fired his prior surgeon general [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1595.46s)]
*  pick, who was a Fox News host. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1600.66s)]
*  But she was actually somewhat qualified, but she was pro vaccine. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1603.26s)]
*  So that made her go the same way Donald Trump fired the head of FEMA today, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1606.5800000000002s)]
*  who was a MAGA guy. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1611.94s)]
*  But he said that FEMA really needs to help communities. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1613.7s)]
*  And so Trump fired the FEMA guy because the FEMA guy was too pro FEMA. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1617.22s)]
*  And the Fox host that he had as the surgeon general was too pro vaccine. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1621.34s)]
*  So they bring in someone named Casey Means. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1626.02s)]
*  Now, Casey Means is not a licensed doctor. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1629.54s)]
*  She quit during her residency. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  She never made it through her residency, which, by the way, you know, as I've said, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1636.1s)]
*  before, as it relates to Jim Jordan, he never took the bar exam. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1641.7s)]
*  And I said, does it look I took the bar exam? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1646.3400000000001s)]
*  Does that make me a smarter person because I passed the bar? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1648.38s)]
*  You know, I mean, I would prefer a licensed lawyer with experience to lead [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1650.78s)]
*  the Judiciary Committee. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1655.8600000000001s)]
*  So the fact that you have a not a not licensed lawyer in Jim Jordan, I don't like [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1657.3s)]
*  that. The Judiciary Committee, someone who never passed the bar exam, you know, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1661.66s)]
*  same thing to surgeon general. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1666.42s)]
*  Let's start with you passed your residency and you're licensed as a doctor. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1668.7s)]
*  We could go up from there. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1675.5s)]
*  But I also don't like when the surgeon general said that the way she found love [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1678.38s)]
*  at the age of 35 was through shrines, full moon ceremonies. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1683.98s)]
*  She talked to trees and then did mushrooms. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1689.74s)]
*  And that was part of her plan. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1692.8600000000001s)]
*  We've got a lot more to discuss on this episode of the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1695.42s)]
*  We covered a lot right there. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1699.8600000000001s)]

*  This episode of the Midas Touch podcast is brought to you by Graza. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1844.3s)]
*  And yes, it's my new favorite olive oil. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1847.1399999999999s)]
*  It's fresh, never blended and comes from a single type of olive, the Pacual, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1849.86s)]
*  straight out of high in Spain, where over half the world's olive oil is made. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1854.1799999999998s)]
*  So what makes Graza so good? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1858.1s)]
*  First, it's single origin, which means no mystery blends, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1859.82s)]
*  just pure flavorful oil you could actually trust. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1863.02s)]
*  And the packaging game changer. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1866.02s)]
*  Squeeze and spray bottles. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1868.1s)]
*  No drippy mess. No fussy tins. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1869.74s)]
*  Just aim, squeeze, done. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1871.6599999999999s)]
*  They've got three types. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1873.6999999999998s)]
*  Frizzle, the newest one for high heat frying and grilling. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1874.74s)]
*  Sizzle your go to everyday oil for sauteing or roasting. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1877.4599999999998s)]
*  And drizzle a bold finishing oil you'll want to put on everything. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1880.82s)]
*  Yes, even ice cream. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1884.4199999999998s)]
*  Don't knock it till you try it. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1886.2199999999998s)]
*  Personally, I love using Graza. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1887.6999999999998s)]
*  It's perfect for when I'm roasting veggies. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1889.4199999999998s)]
*  Super clean, super flavorful and way easier than my old olive oil setup. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1891.3799999999999s)]
*  I've also been making some amazing salad dressings with the drizzle oil. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1895.78s)]
*  It's so good, so convenient. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't think I could ever go back to anything else. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1900.58s)]

*  Where to next? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1941.9s)]
*  You know, like Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's, a guy who came from Wall Street. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1943.54s)]
*  Right. He knows what a tariff is. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1948.82s)]
*  He knows that tariffs are bad. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1952.22s)]
*  Like this, this there are some things [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1955.6200000000001s)]
*  that we shouldn't even have to have debates over. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1958.5s)]
*  Right. We shouldn't have debates over is there due process or not due process? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1961.7s)]
*  There is due process. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1966.74s)]
*  That's the United States of America. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1968.3s)]
*  If you are even having a debate over it, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1970.22s)]
*  the debate is in bad faith because the answer is yes, there's due process period. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1973.74s)]
*  You don't like that. Go to Russia. Go to North Korea. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1978.06s)]
*  We have due process here, even for really bad guys. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1980.18s)]
*  They get due process. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1983.42s)]
*  And then if they're convicted, they get thrown in jail. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1984.5s)]
*  And we should be law and order. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1986.7s)]
*  Law is the first part of it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1989.26s)]
*  And then order law and order. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1991.1s)]
*  That's what there should be. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1993.78s)]
*  We shouldn't we shouldn't have to have debates again over, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1995.22s)]
*  you know, is a tariff a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=1999.82s)]
*  We know what a tariff is. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2001.94s)]
*  A tariff is a tax. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2003.74s)]
*  It is a levy quite literally on the importer in the United States, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2005.7s)]
*  which is passed on the consumer. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2011.26s)]
*  It's the biggest regressive tax in American history. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2013.3400000000001s)]
*  That's what's taking place. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2016.8200000000002s)]
*  That gets passed on to the consumer. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2018.46s)]
*  That's what it is. Not a hard question. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2020.38s)]
*  But people like Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to know better. Why? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2022.3400000000001s)]
*  And the problem is, is it's this whole covid mentality of like a miracle. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2027.94s)]
*  It's all going to go away. It's not happening. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  Seven cases are going to go to zero cases while a gathering storm is happening, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2035.3400000000001s)]
*  while the shores are moving back. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2040.3s)]
*  And the tsunami wave is coming. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2044.7s)]
*  We see it. And all that's happening in the interim is market manipulation, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2047.86s)]
*  which sucks because that's helping regular folk, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2052.02s)]
*  which is why there shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2055.94s)]
*  We see what's happening at the ports. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2058.46s)]
*  We know what's happening. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2060.66s)]
*  I don't think we need to play the clip. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2061.98s)]
*  But the guy who runs the port of Seattle saying he doesn't see ships, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2063.3s)]
*  the guy who runs the port of Long Beach, which is in Los Angeles, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2068.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't see ships, less ships. We're going to run out of supplies. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2071.66s)]
*  They're telling us this. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2074.46s)]
*  And Scott Besson is lying. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2076.86s)]
*  Here was his testimony. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2080.7s)]
*  Here's Treasury Secretary Scott Besson being asked a very simple question [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2082.22s)]
*  by a Democratic congressmember. Who pays the tariff? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2086.1s)]
*  You don't get much more basic than that. Here, play this clip. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2088.58s)]
*  Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2090.98s)]
*  No, no, no, ask the answer the questions I asked, please. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2098.54s)]
*  I only have five minutes. Who pays tariffs? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2100.86s)]
*  Sorry. Well, who pays tariffs? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2102.66s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, please. Excuse me. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2104.94s)]
*  The question is very simply who pays tariffs, Mr. Chairman. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2106.58s)]
*  I'd like him to answer that question. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2109.3s)]

*  Congressman, if the [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2113.1s)]
*  congressman, if the exporters, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2116.5s)]
*  they dislike tariffs so much, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2120.7s)]
*  they why wouldn't they if I think what you're trying to get me to say? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2123.58s)]
*  Did you remember the question? I'm not sure you did. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2127.62s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2129.3399999999997s)]
*  That they it's a very complicated question. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2130.46s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. People pay tariffs, right? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2133.94s)]
*  I'm not reclaiming my time, Mr. Secretary. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2136.8599999999997s)]
*  No, reclaiming my time, Mr. Secretary. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2139.06s)]
*  No, reclaiming my time. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2142.14s)]
*  You clearly aren't going to answer. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2144.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to waste my time having you go, uh, uh, uh, Mr. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2145.7s)]
*  Secretary, the claimers can't even know what he was trying to say. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2148.8599999999997s)]
*  If the exporters dislike the tariffs so much, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2153.7400000000002s)]
*  just a barrier for them to do trade [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2158.82s)]
*  based on the levy that's being imposed on the on the importer. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2163.34s)]
*  So when they go, oh, well, they're going to they're going to eat the tariff. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2170.1s)]
*  What do you mean they're going to eat the mean they're going to eat it? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2173.34s)]
*  And what are we even talking about? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2177.26s)]
*  They're going to they're going to they're going to eat it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2178.54s)]
*  No, they're going to it's going to happen. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2180.58s)]
*  What happened in China where there's now basically a trade in bar. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2181.94s)]
*  No one's eating it. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2184.3s)]
*  I don't know what they're talking about. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2185.14s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2185.86s)]
*  I don't even know what eating it means, honestly. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2186.46s)]
*  And I guess the only if we really want to dig into this stupidity [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2188.06s)]
*  and I don't know why I'm bothering, I guess the company can eat it [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2191.82s)]
*  and then pay the consumer to buy their product. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2195.58s)]
*  I guess if there's a hundred forty five percent tariff, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2198.66s)]
*  I think that's it doesn't make any sense. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2201.5s)]
*  But the importer just say they just say phrases. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2203.34s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have the cards, Zelinsky. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2206.94s)]
*  You don't have the cards for you. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2208.54s)]
*  Doesn't he have to fold? You don't have the card. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2209.94s)]
*  They're going to eat it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2211.78s)]
*  They're going to eat the tariffs. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2212.7000000000003s)]
*  They just say shit. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2214.0600000000004s)]
*  And their words don't have any meaning. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2215.5s)]
*  Well, in that case, wouldn't the importer be the one eating it [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2218.5s)]
*  if they didn't pass it on to the consumer? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2222.82s)]
*  Yeah, by eating it, you mean the exporter would need to make their prices lower. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2225.2200000000003s)]
*  So when you still add the tariff to the lower priced good, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2230.3s)]
*  it technically evens out to what it was. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2234.94s)]
*  But then you still have the tariff. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2237.2200000000003s)]
*  And a lot of these tariffs are like the Chinese have over 100 percent. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2239.78s)]
*  It's like one hundred forty five percent. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2242.5s)]
*  So it's not even possible thing. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2243.46s)]
*  I want one of the things that we've seen also is that. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2244.98s)]
*  And remember, when it's a China tariff, that's like been saying a tariff [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2247.94s)]
*  on the imports coming from China that's being paid by American businesses. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2251.9s)]
*  That's America paying more. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2255.98s)]
*  That's the American consumer paying more. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2257.98s)]
*  And it's pretty obvious why Scott Besson didn't want to answer that, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2260.2200000000003s)]
*  because he would be directly contradicting Donald Trump, who continues to lie [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2264.26s)]
*  about what a tariff even is, or maybe he honestly doesn't even know what it is, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2268.8199999999997s)]
*  because when we watched that ABC interview the other day, it showed that his mental [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2272.7s)]
*  capacities were at rock bottom. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2275.58s)]
*  And so perhaps Donald Trump doesn't even know what this is. Who knows? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2277.62s)]
*  But Scott Besson definitely knows what this is. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2280.46s)]
*  And he's just trying to protect Donald Trump here by continuing to lie [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2282.2999999999997s)]
*  to the American people about what's going on. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2285.8599999999997s)]
*  I think one of the interesting things that I've seen, I'm not sure if you guys [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2288.22s)]
*  have seen this, but on social media, a lot of companies now are posting [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2291.2599999999998s)]
*  their tariff bills. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2294.46s)]
*  And a lot of these people are people, you know, small business owners [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2295.98s)]
*  who supported Trump. And I think it's actually a really interesting trend [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2298.42s)]
*  that we are seeing, whether it's on Blue Sky or Twitter, on Facebook [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2301.54s)]
*  or whatever, people posting like their statements from DHL [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2305.26s)]
*  that says, in order for you to take this package, you not only have to pay [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2308.7400000000002s)]
*  the price of the goods, but you also owe. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2312.46s)]
*  And these prices are exorbitant, like for, you know, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2314.9s)]
*  goods that don't even cost that much. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2318.86s)]
*  They're paying thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2320.38s)]
*  that they now have to pay. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2323.66s)]
*  And so when Donald Trump says we're getting rich, we're getting rich, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2325.06s)]
*  maybe he's just speaking about himself because the people [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2328.2599999999998s)]
*  who are actually paying those fees are American businesses [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2331.2599999999998s)]
*  and the American people. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2334.62s)]
*  Now, most employment in America [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2336.66s)]
*  actually comes from small and medium sized businesses. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2340.74s)]
*  Right. The big corporations are out there lobbying for their exemptions. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2344.54s)]
*  But the small and medium sized businesses are getting absolutely screwed. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2349.8999999999996s)]
*  And so when Besant or Lutnik say, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2355.18s)]
*  well, look, I've spoken to a lot of corporations and they've [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2358.2999999999997s)]
*  already built up the inventory to be ready for this situation. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2362.1s)]
*  Small and medium sized businesses are not. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2367.46s)]
*  And what this all leads us to head towards. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2370.14s)]
*  I've said it before, I've called it a Tom Hanks moment, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2374.8599999999997s)]
*  because remember when Tom Hanks got COVID? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2378.74s)]
*  And by the way, Australia took great care of him. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2380.98s)]
*  After Donald Trump's lies, like a miracle, it's all going to go away. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2383.34s)]
*  It's great. Everything's amazing. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2386.5800000000004s)]
*  Tom Hanks got COVID and then everyone was like, whoa, this is real. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2388.34s)]
*  It's not going away. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2392.86s)]
*  And then we had Trump lockdowns. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2394.5s)]
*  Remember, when is there going to be that Tom Hanks moment? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2397.02s)]
*  Because Trump's entire life has been that [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2401.54s)]
*  when the lies have caught up to him. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2404.86s)]
*  And then there's been a catastrophic event that's led to a bankruptcy. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2407.5800000000004s)]
*  Right. What Donald Trump do in Atlantic City created three casinos [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2412.2200000000003s)]
*  right next to each other that cannibalized each other. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2415.46s)]
*  He over leveraged it. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2418.1400000000003s)]
*  He told everybody it was going great. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2419.5s)]
*  And then one day, bankrupt, everybody loses their jobs. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2421.34s)]
*  Contractors don't get paid. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2425.26s)]
*  Employees get fired. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2427.0600000000004s)]
*  It devastates all of Atlantic City. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2428.42s)]
*  And there were so many people saying, dude, if you open up three casinos [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2430.78s)]
*  next to each other and you take and you're over leveraged the way you are, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2434.1400000000003s)]
*  of course, you're going to go bankrupt. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2437.6600000000003s)]
*  And Trump would try to get those people fired. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2439.3s)]
*  The experts fired. Right. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2441.78s)]
*  That's what Trump did during Covid. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2443.3s)]
*  When the Ponzi scheme runs out, he blames the expert. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2444.82s)]
*  And now he's trying to Dr. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2447.6600000000003s)]
*  Fauci, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2449.1400000000003s)]
*  And so when things go bad, when it all blows up, they're going to blame Powell. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2452.5s)]
*  And you're going to hear Powell did this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2456.7400000000002s)]
*  If he just lowered the interest rates, we'd be good. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2458.2200000000003s)]
*  We would have figured it out. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2460.26s)]
*  That's the campaign that they're running right now. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2461.5s)]
*  Now, let me show you this. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2464.02s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, like all these Trump regime members, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2465.26s)]
*  they go on TV and they talk about because Donald Trump, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2469.06s)]
*  Donald Trump says Alcatraz, they say Alcatraz. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2472.7s)]
*  Donald Trump says tariff movies. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2475.18s)]
*  They say tariff movies. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2476.86s)]
*  Donald Trump said it's just parroting what he's saying. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump posts images of himself as the pope. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2481.18s)]
*  Oh, that's so funny. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2484.34s)]
*  You know, isn't this guy the funniest ever? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2485.58s)]
*  And by the way, just let me address quickly the idea of like Trump [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2487.34s)]
*  there and saying that this is a joke and just Donald Trump said that [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2491.74s)]
*  when he claimed that he was going to bring peace to Ukraine in 24 hours, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2495.7400000000002s)]
*  he told Time magazine that that was a joke. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2499.82s)]
*  And he said it was in jest. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2503.1800000000003s)]
*  And if the fake news took him seriously, they shouldn't have. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2504.58s)]
*  So Donald Trump uses the concept of jokes, which, by the way, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2508.1000000000004s)]
*  there's a time and a place for jokes. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2511.78s)]
*  You know what time and a place for a joke in the presidency? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2513.34s)]
*  The White House Correspondents Dinner that Donald Trump never shows up to [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  because he can't take he can't take self-deprecating humor. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2519.02s)]
*  There's places for it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2522.26s)]
*  But joking or saying you're joking about [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2523.54s)]
*  bringing peace to Ukraine in 24 hours, that's not a funny joke. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2527.98s)]
*  We're not looking for, you know, offense to clowns [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2532.46s)]
*  because it's a real profession and circuses. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2535.02s)]
*  I don't want to offend Donald Trump. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2536.86s)]
*  We don't we're not looking for that in a leader. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2539.66s)]
*  You're you're being adult. Be grown. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2541.7s)]
*  Behave normally. Just to stop with stop with this crap. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2544.38s)]
*  Anyway, I digress. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2547.46s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2548.5s)]
*  It has to go out there and then say, so what Donald Trump [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2551.54s)]
*  is going to do, I mean, it has this like arrogant face to what Donald Trump [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2554.14s)]
*  really meant, what Donald Trump really meant when he was saying [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2556.98s)]
*  that you get two pencils is that you're going to your life's going to be much better, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2561.66s)]
*  much better to the girls, little girls, little girls, you understand? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2566.54s)]
*  Have your pencil and your one dollar here. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2571.14s)]
*  Watch this. The other thing, too, is this reporter behind me [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2573.62s)]
*  was quite snarky the other day when President Trump talked about [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2578.14s)]
*  the girl having two dolls. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2581.7799999999997s)]
*  And he said, well, what President didn't take the question, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2585.14s)]
*  but he said, what would you tell that girl? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2587.86s)]
*  I said, I would tell that young girl [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2589.5s)]
*  that you will have a better life than your parents, that you and your family, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2592.2599999999998s)]
*  thanks to President Trump, can now be confident again [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2596.1s)]
*  that you will have a better life than your parents, which working class [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2599.7s)]
*  Americans had abandoned that idea. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2602.66s)]
*  Your family will own a home. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2604.62s)]
*  You will be able to the advance. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2606.46s)]
*  You will have a good education. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2609.62s)]
*  You will have economic freedom. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2610.98s)]
*  That's what we are advancing. Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2613.1s)]
*  That's why you get one doll and one pencil and you pay more for it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2616.42s)]
*  Housing is less affordable right now. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2620.98s)]
*  Not more affordable. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2624.7s)]
*  We're not move. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2626.18s)]
*  We're not moving towards a situate. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2627.42s)]
*  And by the way, if tariffs are working great, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2629.7799999999997s)]
*  then why are you trying to do deals that remove the tariffs? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2633.9s)]
*  And of course, there's no intellectual consistency here [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2638.3s)]
*  because there's nothing intellectual going on. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2641.94s)]
*  I'll show you this clip right here about the ultimate ironies. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2643.7000000000003s)]
*  Let me show this video of these little girls that the Trump campaign [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2647.5s)]
*  and like the MAGA supporters put out there during the campaign. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2651.26s)]
*  We're even just just there's always a clip for everything with Donald Trump, right? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2654.02s)]
*  Where these little girls like we he's going to give us more Barbies [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2657.6600000000003s)]
*  and we're going to get Barbies cheap. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2661.0600000000004s)]
*  And that's like the message that right wing media was pushing [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2662.86s)]
*  over and over again. We're going to get Barbies. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2666.54s)]
*  And now literally Trump's central planning says you get one doll and one pencil. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2668.54s)]
*  Here, watch this. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2672.38s)]
*  What do you want him to do? What do you want him to say today? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2673.2200000000003s)]
*  I want him I want him to lower prices [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2678.58s)]
*  and lower the taxes and make Barbies cheaper. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2683.1800000000003s)]
*  Barbies cheaper. Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2689.62s)]
*  Tell me more about that. Have they gotten expensive? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2691.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And Polly pockets. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2693.58s)]
*  All my favorite toys are so expensive. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2695.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, by the way, by the way, real quick, I just like [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2698.22s)]
*  that's what indoctrination looks like. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2701.02s)]
*  Like I like I feel I feel for those girls. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2702.7s)]
*  And, you know, they're just given talking points by their parents [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2705.4199999999996s)]
*  to say these things at these rallies. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2708.14s)]
*  And it actually actually breaks my heart a bit. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2709.74s)]
*  That I haven't seen that clip. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2713.3799999999997s)]
*  Holy cow. There truly is a clip for everything. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2715.5s)]
*  Un friggin believable. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2718.74s)]
*  Speaking of the clip for everything. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2720.8199999999997s)]
*  Then you have Kash Patel, somehow the FBI director. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2722.42s)]
*  He shows up for a Senate hearing today on the FBI budget. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2726.5s)]
*  And he doesn't do his homework, right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2731.02s)]
*  He doesn't hand in his homework, which, like literally, you have to turn over [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2732.62s)]
*  the budget so that the Senate can go through it and ask you about your budget. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2736.1800000000003s)]
*  So the senators are asking him, where where is it? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2741.38s)]
*  You know, it was due by law. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2745.42s)]
*  It was due. And you violated the law. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2746.98s)]
*  Are you going to follow it? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2749.58s)]
*  Watch FBI direct. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2751.3s)]
*  This is why this shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican thing, right? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2753.1000000000004s)]
*  This is why this should just be an American people thing. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2756.38s)]
*  And the American people think, wait a minute, you're not you're not even doing your home. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2759.94s)]
*  We're not even submitting the budget. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2762.9s)]
*  And then when he's asked, like, so are you just going to violate the law? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2764.6600000000003s)]
*  He's like, I'll submit it to you when I want to submit it to you. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2767.3s)]
*  Just think about that. Just think about where you work. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2770.42s)]
*  Matt, you tell your boss, did you hand in your thing? No. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2773.1800000000003s)]
*  Why? No, I'm not going to do it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2776.26s)]
*  Are you do you plan on doing it? No. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2778.42s)]
*  When? When I want to. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2780.86s)]
*  You watch this clip. I have a timeline on that. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2782.7000000000003s)]
*  It was due last week by law. I understand. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2785.98s)]
*  And your answer is you just understand you're not going to follow the law. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2789.9s)]
*  My answer is that I am following the law and I'm working with my interagency [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2793.26s)]
*  partners to do this and get you the budget that you are required to have. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2796.58s)]
*  And you have no timeline. No. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2801.1s)]
*  Well, we also need a full budget request. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2808.26s)]
*  Not a single paragraph full of wild talking points that we saw with the skinny budget proposal. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2810.86s)]
*  We're now having a budget hearing without a budget request. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2816.1400000000003s)]
*  So, Director Patel, where is the FY 2026 budget request for the FBI? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2819.46s)]
*  It's being worked on, ma'am. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2825.2200000000003s)]
*  Have you reviewed it? Have you approved it? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2826.86s)]
*  Not yet. When will we get it? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2830.38s)]
*  As soon as I can get it from my interagency partners and get it approved. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2832.6200000000003s)]
*  Six months from now. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2837.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know, ma'am. Well, how do we as Congress do our budget [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2838.94s)]
*  and our work without that request and without the spend plan? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2842.42s)]
*  Ma'am, I'm here. I'm doing the best I can. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2845.82s)]
*  I can't make up answers. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2847.42s)]
*  I'm going to commit to you to work on getting you the information you need. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2848.54s)]
*  That is insufficient and deeply disturbing. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2852.34s)]
*  No response. I've given my response. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2857.5s)]
*  Well. Again, can you imagine if Pete [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2863.58s)]
*  Buttigieg, transportation secretary, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2867.14s)]
*  can you imagine if the previous FBI director under Donald Trump [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2870.66s)]
*  was who was competent, showed up and did that? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2876.18s)]
*  Can you imagine what what we'd be talking about here? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2880.5s)]
*  And again, what the hell is that? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2884.62s)]
*  This is where I get I don't care what political party you're from. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=2886.22s)]

*  She's making me tacos. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3408.14s)]
*  And by the way, Sean Duffy's wife, I'm not making that play word for it, a tweet that [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3409.98s)]
*  he says, hashtag Latino wife. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3413.74s)]
*  And then Sean Duffy's wife is currently a host on the Fox morning show right now. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3415.9s)]
*  Lara Trump has her show on Fox. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3422.0600000000004s)]
*  It's just a bunch of Fox hosts and it's a bunch of people who cosplay and they dress [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3425.1000000000004s)]
*  up like it's Halloween or I guess for Duffy, Dia de los Muertos. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3431.26s)]
*  And they're like pretending they're playing make believe and politics has become so [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3437.9s)]
*  gamified by corporate news. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3448.94s)]
*  And we're like, these people are not... [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3450.86s)]
*  These aren't the people who should be in these positions. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3452.54s)]
*  Again, stop Republican Democrat. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3454.86s)]
*  I don't really think that we should have WWE wrestlers become actual professional athletes. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3457.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3466.46s)]
*  What in the world is going on here anyway? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3469.34s)]
*  There's nothing to say about judging. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3471.26s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3472.94s)]
*  This is an embarrassment right here. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3474.38s)]
*  Maybe not quite as embarrassing of the secretary general or the surgeon general [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3478.38s)]
*  that Trump's picking. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3484.3s)]
*  Casey Means not actually being a licensed doctor and not passing her residency, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3485.7400000000002s)]
*  but maybe it's tied or quite close. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3492.54s)]
*  The big beautiful budget bill, that's what Donald Trump's calling the stupid thing, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3496.46s)]
*  which is going to gut your Medicaid, like $880 billion. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3501.1s)]
*  One of their scams they're trying to do is shift the Medicaid financial burden to states. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3505.26s)]
*  Many states already have trigger laws, which would automatically stop state funding of [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3510.94s)]
*  Medicaid if federal funding shuts off. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3518.3s)]
*  But then even states that don't have the trigger laws, they don't have the funds to fund Medicaid. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3520.54s)]
*  There's a role for federal government. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3525.1s)]
*  You need federal government to do certain things. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3527.8199999999997s)]
*  States don't have the ability to coordinate natural disasters themselves. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3529.8199999999997s)]
*  They can help. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3533.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't have those resources. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3534.7799999999997s)]
*  States don't. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3536.06s)]
*  That's why our system of federalism relies on cooperation between the federal government [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3536.54s)]
*  and state governments. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3540.7799999999997s)]
*  So Trump fired the FEMA guy, who is a MAGA guy, because the guy said he takes his job, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3541.74s)]
*  but even though he's MAGA, he says FEMA needs to do a better job reacting to the states. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3547.98s)]
*  See you later. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3553.1s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3553.74s)]
*  That gets you fired. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3554.14s)]
*  They walked him in and they perp walked him out today. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3554.94s)]
*  MAGA FEMA guy, just because he said he cares about FEMA. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3558.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to be like a Linda McMahon, who runs the Department of Education, who's willing to gut [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3561.02s)]
*  $2 billion in mental health money for mental health treatment in schools. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3566.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what they're doing because she's so rich, it doesn't affect her, and she doesn't give a crap [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3573.5s)]
*  about public schools. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3577.5s)]
*  They care about private schools and helping businesses run private schools. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3578.54s)]
*  Linda McMahon gets rid of all mental health treatment in public schools and she says, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3583.82s)]
*  she's so rich, nothing matters to her. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3589.7400000000002s)]
*  She's like, yeah, I'm going to fire myself. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3592.3s)]
*  They try to destroy the Department of Education from within. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3595.42s)]
*  Anyway, moving back to this budget, what they call the big, beautiful bill that gets Medicaid [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3598.38s)]
*  and it's not beautiful, it's a big disaster. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3604.86s)]
*  You have MAGA Republicans at war with each other, basically, because [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3607.6600000000003s)]
*  one group of MAGA Republicans want to get rid of Medicaid, the other group of MAGA Republicans [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3612.06s)]
*  want to get rid of Medicaid, they just don't want people to know about it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3616.7799999999997s)]
*  Because you all have made loud noise, we've all exposed it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  Democrats have exposed it, the people have exposed what they're doing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3623.74s)]
*  They tried to hide it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3626.94s)]
*  They tried to say, no, this is actually $800 billion getting removed from the Commerce [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3628.2999999999997s)]
*  Committee. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3632.62s)]
*  Everyone's like, okay, that means Medicaid. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3633.18s)]
*  Okay, that means you're getting rid of Medicaid. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3634.46s)]
*  So they got caught there. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3636.2999999999997s)]
*  Now they're like, oh crap, now we're going to get voted out for sure. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3637.58s)]
*  If we cut Medicaid, so we can't do that. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3641.1s)]
*  So now you have this tension taking place. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3643.42s)]
*  And then on the Senate, while this reconciliation is happening, where the Senate has a bill [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3645.5s)]
*  and the House has a bill and they have to blend them together through these markups [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3650.94s)]
*  and whatever, the MAGA Republicans in the Senate are already saying, we're not going [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3655.3399999999997s)]
*  to pass the House bill, zero chance. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3658.7s)]
*  So we're all wasting your time. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3660.2999999999997s)]
*  Don't believe me. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3661.98s)]
*  Here's the pretty far right-wing guy, MAGA Republican Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3662.94s)]
*  Here's what he's got to say. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3668.06s)]
*  Let's play. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3668.86s)]
*  The tax bill, will we get it before Memorial Day? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3669.82s)]
*  No, no, there's no way because again, unfortunately, President Trump chose the one big, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3674.86s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3679.82s)]
*  What he should have done is the multiple step process. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3680.46s)]
*  I suggest the three steps, get the border funding. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3683.1000000000004s)]
*  Second step, just extend current tax law. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3685.9s)]
*  So we take an automatic tax increase off the table. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3688.7000000000003s)]
*  Will we get it before the end of the year quickly? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3689.98s)]
*  Not if we don't come down with a reasonable pre-pandemic level spending. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3693.6600000000003s)]
*  There's enough of us in the Senate that will not agree to that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3696.78s)]
*  Oh boy, that's bad news. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3698.62s)]
*  Senator, thank you for that. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3700.2999999999997s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3701.66s)]
*  Have a good weekend. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3702.14s)]
*  Appreciate you coming on. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3703.02s)]
*  You too. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3704.14s)]
*  And again, this is like, don't look up, right? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3705.18s)]
*  Like we know what's going to, you don't believe him there. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3707.98s)]
*  He said it again today. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3712.06s)]
*  Here, let me show you him saying it again today. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3712.8599999999997s)]
*  Here, let me play this clip. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3714.7799999999997s)]
*  Arguing over additional tax provisions and getting down to a reasonable pre-pandemic [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3716.62s)]
*  spending level, but that's not the path we chose. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3721.3399999999997s)]
*  So I think the sooner we acknowledge the fact that this current effort is doomed to fail. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3723.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3728.86s)]
*  I've got a discreet press on this. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3729.98s)]
*  It's doomed to fail. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3731.98s)]
*  I'm not going to vote for it. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3733.34s)]
*  I know a number of senators who will not even come, we're not even contemplating. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3734.38s)]
*  This is, this is not a start right now as it's being written, we would actually increase [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3738.06s)]
*  the deficit. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3742.86s)]
*  Many people realize that we would actually increase the deficit. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3745.5s)]
*  That's a complete non-starter. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3748.3s)]
*  So no, we're, we're not even close. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3749.58s)]
*  It's not a moral. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3751.5s)]
*  So as I was saying before, you know, the movie don't look up, right? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3753.98s)]
*  The comet or the asteroids coming and everybody's acting like it isn't. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3757.5s)]
*  So we know what's happening at the ports. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3761.26s)]
*  We know what's happening with this bill. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3763.5s)]
*  We know what's happening with inflation. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3765.42s)]
*  We know what's happening with the fundamentals of the economy. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3767.42s)]
*  We know where that's moving. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3770.14s)]
*  So as I said, this Tom Hanks moment where it's like, ah, that should never happen. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3772.38s)]
*  Leadership should avoid that from happening. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3777.5s)]
*  That may mean when you're a leader, you have to be honest. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3780.86s)]
*  You have to confront the situation. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3784.62s)]
*  You have to explain things. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3786.78s)]
*  You have to let people know you have to, you have to alter your strategies if they're not [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3788.78s)]
*  working. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3793.34s)]
*  But Donald Trump's like a miracle. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3794.94s)]
*  It's all going to go away. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3796.46s)]
*  It's not what you're happening. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3797.7400000000002s)]
*  This tariffs are the greatest thing ever. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3798.7000000000003s)]
*  Things are amazing. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3801.26s)]
*  Gas is a dollar and 89 when it's not eggs are down 87% when it's not. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3802.7000000000003s)]
*  We've solved inflation. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3808.2200000000003s)]
*  Inflation's up. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3809.5s)]
*  Which is not, that's just not how you run things. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3811.34s)]
*  And we just want us to use our logic and our basic humanity, you know, and common sense [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3813.74s)]
*  to say, we know where this is headed. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3820.22s)]
*  We know where this is headed. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3823.18s)]
*  Brett, I want you to talk about the pope if you can, because, you know, that was, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3825.74s)]
*  that was an interesting pick today when we found out, right, that it was going to be [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3833.1s)]
*  an American pope. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3836.3s)]
*  And so there was a lot of, there was a lot of people wondering, you know, who is Cardinal [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3837.66s)]
*  Robert Prevost, right? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3845.02s)]
*  He's someone who was, spent most of his time in Peru, but he is American, who was in Chicago [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3847.9s)]
*  for quite some time. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3853.34s)]
*  We saw this from the guy who sits on the White House's Commission on Religious Liberty, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3854.86s)]
*  someone named Bishop Robert Barron. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3860.54s)]
*  And he said, until America goes into political decline, there won't be an American pope. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3862.7s)]
*  He was citing a Cardinal George of Chicago, you know, he goes, because the Vatican doesn't [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3869.66s)]
*  want America to have a pope while it's running the world politically, culturally, and economically. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3875.3399999999997s)]
*  They don't want America running the world religiously. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3881.02s)]
*  But one of the signs of America declined by the Vatican would be to pick an American [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3884.06s)]
*  pope. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3888.22s)]
*  And so it seems that the Vatican was actually sending a message here as well to the United [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3889.02s)]
*  States. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3894.86s)]
*  All right, we'll give you your pope now because that's like, because he wasn't the front [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3896.06s)]
*  runner, you know, from, you know, and by the way, this guy's, by all accounts, this pope [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3900.62s)]
*  seems like, you know, he's, he's gonna facilitate some of the good stuff that Pope Francis did. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3905.26s)]
*  But he wasn't the easy pick. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3912.38s)]
*  But then when you explain it like that, you're like, oh, and Magus freaking out, Brett. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3913.9s)]
*  Yeah, Magus losing it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3918.3s)]
*  I mean, just to kind of, you know, get back to the beginning here, just the basic facts, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3919.5s)]
*  you know, this morning, I think we all saw the white smoke emanating from the Sistine [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3923.9s)]
*  Chapel chimney that signifies that a new pope has indeed been elected in conclave. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3929.42s)]
*  By the way, the timing of that movie, I mean, my God, did they get lucky. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3935.42s)]
*  But we saw yesterday there was the black smoke, which meant that, you know, that there was no [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3940.2200000000003s)]
*  pope elected. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3944.6200000000003s)]
*  And some people thought that this was going to take quite a bit. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3945.26s)]
*  And then I think everybody was shocked when all of a sudden the white smoke was coming up [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3947.82s)]
*  today. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3951.02s)]
*  And we then learned about, I don't know, about an hour or so later that the person who was [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3951.26s)]
*  selected is Cardinal Robert Francis Pravos. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3955.5s)]
*  He is from Chicago, of all places, the first pope from the United States in history, the [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3958.2200000000003s)]
*  267th pope. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3963.98s)]
*  He has now taken the name, you know, the popes take, take other names. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3965.98s)]
*  He's taken the name of Pope Leo the 14th. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3969.1000000000004s)]
*  And immediately, you know, our researchers started looking him up and found his Twitter [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3972.06s)]
*  account right away. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3977.18s)]
*  He tweets and not that much, but when he does tweet, he's quite intentional about it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3977.8999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, his tweets are honestly the kinds of things that you would expect somebody [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3982.06s)]
*  who embraces the tenets of Christianity to be speaking about, right? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3986.2999999999997s)]
*  Speaking about, you know, positively about immigrants, speaking about, you know, caring [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3990.62s)]
*  for thy neighbor. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3995.4199999999996s)]
*  When you look at his tweets, it is like the fundamentals of Catholicism, of Christianity. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=3996.8599999999997s)]
*  But I think the funny thing that kind of happens in these moments, and it happened all the time [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4001.8199999999997s)]
*  with Pope Francis, and by the way, Pope Leo the 14th was actually very close with Pope [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4006.62s)]
*  Francis, shares a lot of his beliefs about things, is known to be kind of centrist, but [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4011.5s)]
*  more progressive on a lot of these kind of key social issues. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4015.5s)]
*  One of the things I think we realize when there are these moments is how contradictory [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4018.7799999999997s)]
*  the MAGA ideology and the Republican notion of Jesus in the United States is to that of the [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4025.1s)]
*  actual church. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4032.38s)]
*  And when those come into conflict, MAGA doesn't know how to react. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4033.58s)]
*  And so they lash out. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4037.2599999999998s)]
*  They call him a DEI Pope. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4038.7799999999997s)]
*  They call him a Democrat. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4041.1s)]
*  They call him a woke lib. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4043.1s)]
*  Like they call him, they try to just throw all these words out here to try to smear the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4044.54s)]
*  person who is simply just speaking about the tenets of his religion and somebody who hasn't [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4049.2599999999998s)]
*  even said much, even in English at all, I think at this point, about his papacy. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4054.06s)]
*  And so when you look at his old tweets, I think they're very revealing about who he [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4058.38s)]
*  is as an individual. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4062.38s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why MAGA is so furious right now, because you look at [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4063.6600000000003s)]
*  his tweets, you see some of the ones right here. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4067.58s)]
*  Recently, this is in February 2025, he wrote on Twitter, Pope Francis's letter, JD Vance, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4070.62s)]
*  and what the gospel asks of us all on immigration. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4078.78s)]
*  One of the other tweets he posted around then was JD Vance is wrong. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4081.82s)]
*  Jesus does not ask us to rank our love for others. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4085.1800000000003s)]
*  A very recent post from him was about Donald Trump sending immigrants to these prison camps [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4088.7799999999997s)]
*  in El Salvador. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4095.66s)]
*  You know, he was harshly critical of Donald Trump on that and was retweeting other people [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4096.62s)]
*  who were being critical about that. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4101.0199999999995s)]
*  He retweeted Senator Chris Murphy on gun control in 2017. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4102.94s)]
*  He's tweeted in the past about Donald Trump, you know, going back at least we saw going [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4107.34s)]
*  back at least to 2015 about the things that Donald Trump has said about migrants, being [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4111.9s)]
*  highly critical of him there. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4116.46s)]
*  And you could just go through kind of all of his tweets, you know, go through what the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4118.62s)]
*  things that he was saying about COVID-19. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4121.34s)]
*  You see November 2015, sign the Catholic climate petition. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4123.82s)]
*  So, you know, you have all these things that are happening. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4127.58s)]
*  And so you have the typical MAGA folks, the MAGA propagandists, once again, lashing out [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4130.14s)]
*  because the concept of faith and their ideology, where they, their religion, let's face it, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4136.3s)]
*  is MAGA. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4143.0199999999995s)]
*  Their religion is Donald Trump. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4143.98s)]
*  That is their God. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4145.66s)]
*  And so when anybody, especially in a role like this, goes against their God, they don't [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4147.02s)]
*  know how to react. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4152.14s)]
*  And so we saw just all these deranged posts. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4153.26s)]
*  Laura Loomer called him a woke Marxist pope. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4155.580000000001s)]
*  She was like leading the charge against the new pope. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4158.780000000001s)]
*  We saw this guy, Joey Manarino, saying, Pope Leo XIV is not an American. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4161.900000000001s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4166.860000000001s)]
*  Just read his Twitter feed. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4167.900000000001s)]
*  That's very revealing also about the way that they view Democrats in this country. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4169.26s)]
*  One of the comments to that person said another MAGA wrote, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4173.9s)]
*  This bolstered the New World Order fight against Donald Trump and the American people, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4177.42s)]
*  feeling discouraged. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4181.58s)]
*  I mean, these people are, this is like mental illness that we're seeing right here. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4182.78s)]
*  Laura Loomer was just on a rampage today. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4186.3s)]
*  She said, This is the new pope. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4188.3s)]
*  His name is Robert Prevost. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4189.66s)]
*  He's the first American pope. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4191.34s)]
*  He's anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4192.62s)]
*  Catholics don't have anything good to look forward to. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4197.74s)]
*  Just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4200.22s)]
*  Sean Davis, another one of these MAGAs, the new pope seems to be anti-Trump and pro-open borders. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4203.26s)]
*  It's just so pathetic when you see this, like every kind of moment, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4208.62s)]
*  they just have to like view everything through the lens of what does Donald Trump think about this? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4212.94s)]
*  I must be loyal to my leader. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4217.34s)]
*  I must be loyal to my God, Donald Trump. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4218.86s)]
*  And it's just so incredibly embarrassing when you see it like that. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4220.94s)]
*  This reaction was no different. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4223.66s)]
*  But obviously a big day for Catholics, a big day for the world. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4226.94s)]
*  And a historic moment to have an American pope. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4233.34s)]
*  Crazy thing. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4237.9s)]
*  You know, just think of a pope from Chicago who graduated from Villanova University. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4238.38s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of wild, no? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4242.06s)]
*  He's finally spent like, what, 20 years, I think, in Peru, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4243.42s)]

*  He speaks like eight languages, obviously like a brilliant dude. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4247.5s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it was like the second day of them doing the voting and he's in. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4253.5s)]
*  There you have it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4258.22s)]
*  So wild. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4259.66s)]
*  I don't know if this is going to come out correct, but it's just like, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4260.54s)]
*  MAGA attacking the pope? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4264.7s)]
*  It's Chef's Kiss, like just pure comedy. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4268.7s)]
*  What timeline are we living in? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4272.54s)]
*  These people are so sick. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4273.82s)]
*  Like, please, MAGA, go touch some grass. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4275.099999999999s)]
*  Go outside, take a breather. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4278.86s)]
*  You're attacking the pope? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4281.58s)]
*  It's utterly ridiculous. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4285.179999999999s)]
*  Think about how much they smeared former president Joe Biden and his religion. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4286.46s)]
*  And he was a devout Catholic, a practicing Catholic, somebody who went to church every [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4292.46s)]
*  single week and how they hold up Donald Trump as this beacon of religiosity and piety when he [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4296.54s)]
*  represents like quite literally every sin that Donald Trump did. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4303.34s)]
*  But you did nail it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4307.26s)]
*  The MAGA, their God is Donald Trump. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4308.54s)]
*  And he is infallible to them. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4312.700000000001s)]
*  So those two things are in contradiction at the end of the day. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4315.1s)]
*  And so, I mean, you see it play out. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4318.9400000000005s)]
*  But that's why we always say here that this whole MAGA movement, the only way it can operate [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4320.9400000000005s)]
*  when there are no facts, right? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4327.5s)]
*  The only way it could operate is when they live in this alternate reality. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4329.26s)]
*  So, Ben, you were speaking before about what a leader would do is tell the truth, right? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4333.42s)]
*  What a leader would do is say, these are the things that are going to be happening. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4338.3s)]
*  There are going to be these shortages. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4341.5s)]
*  It is going to be difficult. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4342.94s)]
*  But I think what they learned from, I think they always learn the wrong lessons. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4345.66s)]
*  They learn that you got to lie more. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4348.54s)]
*  From COVID, they didn't learn that, oh, we should have been more prepared for this disease. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4349.98s)]
*  We should have been more open with the American people. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4354.7s)]
*  We should have tested more people. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4357.02s)]
*  No, if you ask these MAGA people right now, they double down on everything they did in COVID. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4358.54s)]
*  They say that, oh, we were actually right during COVID. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4362.94s)]
*  Actually, COVID wasn't really that bad, even though millions of people died. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4365.1s)]
*  It actually wasn't that bad. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4368.46s)]
*  People, you know, it was just, you know, everyone just went crazy and it was just like a little cold. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4369.82s)]
*  And why did everybody freak out? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4374.62s)]
*  And they refuse to ever step back for one second and say, you know what? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4376.3s)]
*  Maybe, just maybe it would have been better, you know, if we actually acknowledged the reality of [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4382.46s)]
*  the situation, the gravity of the situation. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4387.099999999999s)]
*  They just know that if they continue to steamroll with their propaganda networks and their lies, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4389.34s)]
*  and they just keep going, that they will ultimately be able to bring those MAGA die [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4393.74s)]
*  hearts along with them on this fake reality journey that they have. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4398.38s)]
*  That applies whether we're talking the pope, it applies whether we're talking COVID shortages, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4402.22s)]
*  you name it. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4407.1s)]
*  It's all propped up by this house of cards of lies. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4408.06s)]
*  Again, if the tariffs are working so well against China right now, we're crushing it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4411.18s)]
*  Why are we rushing to try to make a deal? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4416.06s)]
*  Why is Besant even talking to them? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4418.9400000000005s)]
*  Isn't this winning? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4420.62s)]
*  I mean, isn't this what they say is great? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4422.14s)]
*  I mean, if tariffs were so great, why don't you do 500%? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4423.74s)]
*  Why don't you do a million percent? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4427.02s)]
*  If that's the correlation, I mean, obviously, because the tariffs aren't so great. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4429.1s)]
*  And then let's just assume there's a pause on the tariffs with China, and that that's [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4433.900000000001s)]
*  viewed somehow as a deal and a win. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4440.06s)]
*  I just want everybody to think about just the framework of the win for Trump. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4442.9400000000005s)]
*  This is how much he's babied by corporate news. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4448.7s)]
*  And it's viewed as a deal or a win when he slightly backpedals on a disastrous decision [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4451.58s)]
*  that he made. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4459.82s)]
*  And whereas former President Biden has to be perfect with everything, and then even [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4461.18s)]
*  when he has 50 to 60% returns in the market, the 16.2 million jobs, 40,000 infrastructure [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4465.82s)]
*  projects, record low unemployment, energy independence, the most drilling ever while [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4471.74s)]
*  focusing on climate change, bringing the semiconductor industry here to the United [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4476.7s)]
*  States. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4481.099999999999s)]
*  Even when you do all of that, that's doing all of that's never strengthening NATO, two [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4481.5s)]
*  new nations joining NATO, countering Putin's aggression. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4486.3s)]
*  Like you can do all of that, but you're viewed negatively. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4490.86s)]
*  And Donald Trump can do the most disastrous things for corporate news and then slightly [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4495.26s)]
*  unwind a disastrous thing that he did. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4501.1s)]
*  And then that's viewed as like, oh, look, wow, he did a deal. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4505.18s)]
*  He didn't do a deal. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4507.820000000001s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4508.860000000001s)]
*  He didn't do a deal with UK with all of these 90. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4509.660000000001s)]
*  A trade deal takes three and a half years to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4513.1s)]
*  So the fact that Donald Trump ripped up the USMCA, the United States, Mexico, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4517.900000000001s)]
*  Canada agreement, ripped up a deal he did with Japan, ripped up prior deals with the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4522.46s)]
*  UK, ripped up a trading relationship with the European Union. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4527.18s)]
*  I can go on and on and on and then slightly adopts something that was part of a deal that [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4530.62s)]
*  was already in place. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4538.46s)]
*  A deal that does not make. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4539.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4541.5s)]
*  That's not called a deal. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4541.74s)]
*  The problem is the incentive structure, though, I think that's in our media and in our [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4543.34s)]
*  financial system, which is completely backwards, which is when Donald Trump does backtrack on [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4547.58s)]
*  something a little bit after making everybody suffer, you know, and then he cuts the tariffs [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4553.82s)]
*  from, okay, instead of 100%, it's 95%. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4557.66s)]
*  When he does these little stupid moves, what happens? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4560.06s)]
*  You get a quick stock market pump, right? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4562.780000000001s)]
*  You get the news making all these headlines that they made a deal like that whole machine [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4564.780000000001s)]
*  turns on. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4569.660000000001s)]
*  And what Trump, I think, is savvy enough to know through all of his batch of crazy moves [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4570.46s)]
*  is that he can manipulate the media easily. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4575.9800000000005s)]
*  He can manipulate the stock market easily. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4577.9800000000005s)]
*  He can manipulate all of his followers easily. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4580.14s)]
*  All he has to do is do one little sort of thing and they go, oh, my God, this is amazing. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4582.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4587.26s)]
*  He didn't do anything. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4587.900000000001s)]
*  He's made things so much worse. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4589.02s)]
*  Everything is still on. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4590.780000000001s)]
*  There is no deal. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4591.900000000001s)]
*  Let's get back to reality, folks. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4593.1s)]
*  I know that's what we're trying to do here at the Midas Touch Network. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4594.620000000001s)]
*  Ben, like you said at the Milken Institute in your speech, like, we just got to look [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTW3ipT4fXw&t=4597.34s)]
