# ðŸš¨ California STRIKES BACK with MAJOR ACTION against Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y)
*  California has just said enough is enough and is bringing a massive legal action against the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  regime for their federalizing of the National Guard in California unlawfully. The grounds for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=7.44s)]
*  this lawsuit is exactly what we predicted it was going to be. The lawsuit is brought by [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=16.64s)]
*  California's Attorney General Rob Bonta and the governor's office as well, California Governor [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=21.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom in coordination with each other. What this lawsuit is alleging is that Donald Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=27.36s)]
*  unlawfully invoked this statute, 10 USC section 12406, which calls for federalizing the National [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=34.08s)]
*  Guard under very specific circumstances. When you look at the statute, it's not all that long when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=44.4s)]
*  you actually go and read it, but it actually says that what's required is that the Secretary [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=50.16s)]
*  of Defense coordinate with the governors of the states and the National Guard Bureau in identifying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=56.08s)]
*  and ordering federal service the appropriate members and units of the National Guard. That [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=63.12s)]
*  never happened at all. Donald Trump just sent a letter to the adjudicant general of the National [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=68.16s)]
*  Guard in California saying you are hereby federalized, which in my view makes it on its face [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=74.24s)]
*  unlawful when you go through these specific instances where you can even invoke section [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=79.68s)]
*  12406 in addition to the provision that requires that it take place in coordination with governors. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=85.92s)]
*  It calls for you could only invoke it if there's repelling an invasion by a foreign nation, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=92.56s)]
*  suppressing a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States or subsection [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=99.2s)]
*  3 of 10 USC 12406 says execute that the president can no longer execute the laws of the United [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=105.44s)]
*  States. None of that happened at all. I mean, if you go back and think about what was taking place [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=113.36s)]
*  on Friday, the LAPD talked about that these were peaceful protests, that they thanked the organizers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=117.84s)]
*  and the groups for remaining peaceful. And when things were under control by the L.A. sheriffs, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=125.12s)]
*  by the LAPD, that's when Donald Trump really initiated the National Guard and escalated matters [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=131.52s)]
*  and made it worse. One of the things I'm wondering as well in this major lawsuit that's being brought [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=137.52s)]
*  by the state of California against Donald Trump to enjoin or essentially stop their behavior [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=143.68s)]
*  of federalizing these National Guard troops is I think Trump created evidence against himself. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  In 2020, Donald Trump sat down with George Stephanopoulos and he said that he could not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=156.96s)]
*  move in the National Guard. This is Trump in his own words in 2020. Let's play it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  I promised four years ago at the Democrat, the Republican convention, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=167.44s)]
*  I'm going to restore law and order. And I have accepted Democrat run cities. Look, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=171.68s)]
*  we have laws. We have to go by the laws. We can't move in the National Guard. I can call [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  insurrection, but there's no reason to ever do that. Even in a Portland case, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=182.8s)]
*  we can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=186.8s)]
*  He said it right there. Let's bring in California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who just filed this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=191.84s)]
*  lawsuit. Attorney General Bonta, tell us about the lawsuit that's being filed and if you can describe [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  to us the importance of it. Absolutely. Thank you for having me. We brought a lawsuit today [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=206.0s)]
*  on behalf of the governor and the state of California, challenging as unlawful the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=212.64s)]
*  president's federalization of the National Guard and calling them in to Los Angeles through an [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=218.48s)]
*  executive order that he issued over the weekend. The authority that he relies on, 10 USC 12406, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=225.6s)]
*  does not provide for his ability to call in the National Guard unilaterally the conditions precedent [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=232.32s)]
*  that are required under the statute, either an invasion by a foreign nation or a rebellion to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=238.96s)]
*  overthrow the US government or the regular forces not being sufficient to execute the laws of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=244.08s)]
*  United States. None of those elements are present. There is also a required element that the order [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=250.96s)]
*  to call in the National Guard be issued through the governor of the state at issue. Here, of course, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=258.32s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom, who does objected to the National Guard coming in, did not issue an order [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=264.8s)]
*  and so we believe that the action by the Trump administration is completely unlawful. We sent a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=271.92s)]
*  letter to Pete Hegseth over the weekend. It was ignored, so we are filing a lawsuit in the Northern [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  District of California today seeking an order declaring the president's executive order unlawful [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=282.64s)]
*  and also seeking injunctive relief through a restraining order. We're seeing the consequences [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=289.2s)]
*  of the chaos from Washington, DC being brought here into the state of California, but this is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=295.84s)]
*  actually not limited to California, is it? And the lawsuit is, but the implications here are not in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  the sense that Donald Trump's memo that invokes this statute does not actually mention California [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=309.36s)]
*  or Los Angeles in it at all. It does talk about these specific troops, but in terms of being open [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=316.32s)]
*  for 60 days, it seems that it's not limited to any specific geographic area. It could be interpreted, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=323.52s)]
*  I think, as saying the entire country at Trump's discretion and it's not limited to National Guard. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=331.36s)]
*  It also says, or as other troops as may seem necessary, basically in a former Fox News host, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=337.36s)]
*  Pete Hegseth's discretion, he gets to pick whatever he wants to do. So there's larger [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=344.32s)]
*  implications, not to say that what's going on in California isn't large enough, but there's other [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  states that are going to be impacted by this. No doubt about it, and which is why it's important [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=354.88s)]
*  that we have acted, are acting swiftly, are seeking a rapid court order striking down this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=359.12s)]
*  unlawful executive order that applies, as you mentioned, outside of Los Angeles and throughout [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=366.4s)]
*  the state of California and potentially other states. It's why Democratic governors wrote a letter [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=370.24s)]
*  speaking out against this unlawful action by President Trump. Democratic attorneys general [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  are very active as well because they see what is happening here. It's another attempt by President [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=383.52s)]
*  Trump to unlawfully secure power that he doesn't have, to try to deploy troops that he doesn't have [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=390.16s)]
*  the authority to deploy within the United States, in states, on American soil, in violation of the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=395.84s)]
*  law. The statute that he invokes here, 10 USC 12406, was only used once in the history of the United [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=402.08s)]
*  States. And it was used when in 1970 there was a U.S. Postal Office strike that shut down the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=408.56s)]
*  movement of the U.S. mail because the U.S. Post Office didn't have the workers to operate the system. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=415.44s)]
*  And so the National Guard came in to make mail move and that presumably was based on the third [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=422.24s)]
*  element of the statute that says that the regular forces are not adequate to execute the laws of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=431.04s)]
*  United States of America. So it's never been used in a situation like this. So it's this sort of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=438.08s)]
*  fringe theory, never adopted by a court that the Trump administration is trying to adopt because [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=443.04s)]
*  they like what it gives them, more power on the other end, this ability to deploy troops [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=450.56s)]
*  throughout the nation potentially. So we think we have a really strong case. We think the facts and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=457.12s)]
*  the law are on our side. We've sued the Trump administration today. We are hopeful for an order [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=461.84s)]
*  in short course. You know, as our viewers know, I always want to, I always, when I bring up these [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=467.6s)]
*  things, I always want to stay away from hyperbole and I don't want them to ever think, hey, Ben, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=474.88s)]
*  you and Midas touch, you're just fear mongering. You're just scaring when you say that Donald Trump [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=479.36s)]
*  wants to have troops everywhere. So my catchphrase here, you know, is kind of like when I used to be [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=484.32s)]
*  a litigator and I would call up an exhibit, you know, I would look at the jury and I would say, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  hey, play the clip because we have Donald Trump in his own words, say, we're going to have troops [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=493.92s)]
*  everywhere. This is what he said here. Play this clip. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, we're going to have troops everywhere. We're not going to let this happen to our country. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=509.36s)]
*  We're not going to let our country be torn apart like it was on the fight and this, uh, auto pen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  He says the bar is what I think it is. Now, attorney general Bonta, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=533.84s)]
*  I think something that's not getting enough attention also is just seems that Donald Trump [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  was so thirsty to invoke this statute or declare that he was federalizing the national guard because [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=543.68s)]
*  there's escalation before you ever get to that federalization. I mean, you know, there is the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=552.64s)]
*  governor can use the national guard. There is the governor can work with other states. There's, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=559.2s)]
*  you know, there's escalation within the LAPD and the sheriff. There's, you know, interstate things. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=564.16s)]
*  So it's just for the way he did it. It just seems so intentional and malicious. And I don't think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=569.6s)]
*  that's getting enough attention. Oh, great. You know, the whole project 2025 and the planning [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=576.0s)]
*  and strategy leading up to the election and being implemented since the election is review of these, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=581.36s)]
*  you know, archaic rarely used because they rarely should be used because the factual [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=588.64s)]
*  predicate required for their use is rarely present. Statutes that provide additional authority to the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  executive branch to the president. And you see he's calling everything or many things an emergency or [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=599.36s)]
*  and he's calling immigration and invasion. He chooses those words because those are the words [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=606.96s)]
*  in the statutes that provide him with more authority. So this is by design. He wanted this. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=611.52s)]
*  You're absolutely right that there's a progression to be followed when there's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  law enforcement incidents that need response on the ground. I'll just emphasize that the Los Angeles [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=624.64s)]
*  County Sheriff's Department is the largest sheriff's department in the nation. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department is the third largest police department in the nation. These are [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=635.84s)]
*  huge law enforcement departments and agencies, very well resourced, highly trained, very capable [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=640.24s)]
*  of addressing nearly any issue. And the issues that LA was facing over the weekend, I was in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=646.4s)]
*  close contact with the highest levels of leadership in both departments, was completely under control [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=652.0s)]
*  within the existing resources of the departments. LAPD said it was crickets, it was quiet, they had [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=658.4s)]
*  20 peaceful protesters over the weekend. LA Sheriff had an issue in Paramount later in Compton, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=664.88s)]
*  but they were able to address it with their own resources. They never even had to go to the next [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=670.24s)]
*  step, which is mutual aid, calling the police departments from the other cities in LA County [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=674.32s)]
*  to help, for example, or the neighboring sheriff's departments in Ventura County or Orange County or [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=679.6s)]
*  Santa Barbara to assist. Never even got close to having to ask for mutual aid, much less depleting [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=685.36s)]
*  mutual aid. And then if the National Guard is needed, Governor Newsom can call in the National [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5HC5qFfE-Y&t=692.4000000000001s)]
