# FURIOUS Museums STRIKE BACK against Trump ATTACKS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss)
*  The Trump regime is attacking the museums right here in Los Angeles where I live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=0.0s)]
*  They're going after the Japanese American Museum in Washington, D.C. They're going after the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=5.2s)]
*  African American Smithsonian Museum throughout California. They're going after funding for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=11.84s)]
*  museums and libraries. It's not just unique to California or D.C. We've seen attorney generals [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=17.84s)]
*  throughout the country, whether it's been in Arizona, whether it's been wherever. I mean, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=23.68s)]
*  Michigan, you name it. The Trump regime is shutting down or taking things away from museums, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=29.12s)]
*  not giving funding for critical things. They're in New York. They're going after [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=35.52s)]
*  cultural institutions. Hundreds of nonprofits in New York, for example, are having cuts, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=40.0s)]
*  theater, dance museums, galleries. I gave a speech about this yesterday where I was telling the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=47.6s)]
*  audience, I'm like, I don't want to be the bad guys. Why are we just doing as a country? I know [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=53.76s)]
*  it's not we, the might is mighty. It's just cruelty for the sake of cruelty. And of course, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  we can talk about all the other things, disappearing migrants and just the horrific gutting of Medicaid, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=65.2s)]
*  the treatment of veterans and the firing of veterans. But also, it's like you're going into [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=71.84s)]
*  museums, you're getting rid of artifacts, you're stopping the funding. Why? Just the cruelty is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=76.08s)]
*  the point. This is what I saw this out of Washington, D.C., where they were removing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=80.32s)]
*  the artifacts for the African American History Museum there. Play this. Some artifacts are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=86.32s)]
*  already being removed. Recent executive orders signed by President Trump aimed at removing what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  he called improper ideology could already be affecting the African American History Museum. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Civil rights activist and pastor, Reverend Amos Brown says he was recently notified two of the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=102.24s)]
*  artifacts he loaned to the museum would be returned. One precious and most historic book, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=106.96s)]
*  The First History of the Negro Race, that was written by Reverend George Washington Williams [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  in 1880. The other, a Bible from when he went to demonstrations with Dr. Martin Luther King, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=122.8s)]
*  Jr. and Jesse Jackson. Brown says that he lent the artifacts to the Smithsonian in 2016. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=128.16s)]
*  They would always give him the option of donating the books permanently or renewing the loan. But [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=133.68s)]
*  this time he wasn't asked. Improper ideology, they're going after museums. Let's bring in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=138.56s)]
*  California's Attorney General Ron Bonta. Attorney General Bonta, you've filed lawsuits here in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  California on this issue and you've joined with attorney generals on many other issues which we'll [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=151.12s)]
*  discuss. But you won two preliminary injunctions on Trump's attack on museums and education [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=156.24s)]
*  institutions in California. Can you talk about those cases and the significance of the order? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=162.88s)]
*  Absolutely. And first, I'm grateful that Democratic attorneys general across the nation are [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=169.2s)]
*  working together to make sure that we have a president who follows the law and complies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=173.76s)]
*  with the constitution. Unfortunately, we have a president who is acting in a way that's been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=178.24s)]
*  unacceptable and abnormal. He's violated the law at a very fast pace, high volume, high speed of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=182.72s)]
*  actions. And we've brought 19 lawsuits in 15 weeks, more than one a week. And yesterday, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=188.56s)]
*  within a matter of hours, we got two preliminary injunctions ordered by courts stopping some of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  the unlawful conduct. One is the case you were mentioning where the president sought to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=199.84s)]
*  withhold already congressionally appropriated funding for museums, for libraries, for other [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=205.52s)]
*  agencies, critical and essential services. And in a separate case, we got our preliminary [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=211.84s)]
*  injunction yesterday that enjoined stop prevented the president from withholding critical COVID-19 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=217.6s)]
*  funding that went to schools to address some of the challenges that arose out of COVID-19, like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=226.64s)]
*  learning loss and mental health issues, also technological capacity. That funding was also [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=231.76s)]
*  congressionally appropriated and the president does not have the right to stop it from being [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  sent to the states after it's already been appropriated. So some good wins yesterday. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=243.84s)]
*  And that's been our hallmark so far. We've been winning our cases, broadly speaking, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=249.28s)]
*  getting injunctions, temporary restraining orders, stopping the president from his [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=256.24s)]
*  unconstitutional and unlawful activity. You joined with Democratic attorney generals across the country [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=261.68s)]
*  also to file a lawsuit against Donald Trump and R.F.K. Jr. gutting health and human services. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=267.2s)]
*  I saw the list of the things that were being dismantled by Trump and R.F.K. Everything from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=274.32s)]
*  preventing the first responders in 9-11 to have the full access that they needed to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=283.12s)]
*  people on call and appropriate cancer diagnoses to... You listed them all in the lawsuit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=290.64s)]
*  People who work in mining were not being able to get health care services. They're very specific [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=298.4s)]
*  stuff. It's not a Republican or a Democrat thing. This stuff is literally going to be [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  killing us. It's like the result of people dying. I just feel like we're back to the COVID years [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  again where they didn't give a crap about death. And it's like, what are we talking about here? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=315.92s)]
*  Talk to us about that lawsuit. While not surprising, unfortunately, it's always shocking [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  when you think about it as a human being and the common sense, science-based, evidence-based, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=328.4s)]
*  data-driven steps that we've taken to save lives, extend life, improve people's health. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=333.44s)]
*  We're a long way away from waste, fraud, and abuse here. These are the opposite of waste, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=339.12s)]
*  fraud, and abuse. These are core, essential, critical services that, as you rightfully say, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=344.32s)]
*  save people's lives. And there's this ongoing attempt to dismantle critical agencies at the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=349.44s)]
*  education department, health and human services, and the critical services that they provide. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=355.28s)]
*  They're dismantling them. They're firing employees. They're pulling away resources [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  and critical services. And so it's hard to understand the point you appropriately propose. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=368.08s)]
*  Maybe cruelty is the point. It's certainly the impact and the outcome. And governments provide [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  critical, essential services. And they're taking them away and stripping them away, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=383.28s)]
*  including in the health and human services area where people's lives are at risk because of these [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  cuts. I'm taking these issues one by one. I started with the museums. We talk about health [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  and human services. Then you bring up Department of Education. In the past week, the Department [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  of Education said they were going to cut between a billion and $2 billion in mental health funding. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=403.84s)]
*  After the MAGA Republicans say the sole reason why there are school shootings, they always say [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=411.68s)]
*  it's only because of mental health, not the guns. Okay, so let's do mental health funding. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=418.16s)]
*  And let's also address the guns, which I know you as an attorney general are focused on. We'll get [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  there in a second. But let's just take it. Mental health. Okay, they're going after [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=430.48s)]
*  mental health services and getting rid of that in school. And I know you just spoke recently at a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=436.32s)]
*  mental health symposium or spoke on the issue recently at the Hoover Institute. And so I know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=442.4s)]
*  it's a very important issue to you. It's a very important issue. It is an important issue. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=449.28s)]
*  Cruelty is the point, it seems again. We are massively under-invested when it comes to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=453.68s)]
*  mental health. We need to do more. People need services yesterday. They need access. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=459.36s)]
*  We have high levels of anxiety and depression and other trauma. And we need trauma-informed care. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=465.84s)]
*  And these cutbacks are absolutely devastating. As a government, you're supposed to invest in [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=473.12s)]
*  the services and programs that meet the need, that meet the demand. And the demand for mental [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=480.88s)]
*  health services is through the roof. And so we need to be investing in doing more, not cutting back [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=485.84s)]
*  and pulling back. And so again, the irony you point out or the hypocrisy is very appropriate [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  when you talk about gun violence. Republicans like to say guns don't kill people. People kill people. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=498.88s)]
*  And mental health is the issue. And then you say, what are you doing about mental health? And then [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=504.64s)]
*  you've got crickets. And that's the truth of the hypocrisy. But it would be funny if it weren't so [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=507.84s)]
*  tragic and dangerous. And people's lives are at risk. Their health is at risk. And so it's hard [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=514.88s)]
*  to understand the end game here of destroying critical services from the federal government. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=523.76s)]
*  But we are seeing the human devastation. And unfortunately, it will only continue if these [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=528.32s)]
*  unlawful and cruel actions continue. Sometimes when I cover this, it feels like [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=534.32s)]
*  whack-a-mole. Because you have all the things that we discussed. And then it's like, oh, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=542.08s)]
*  then Donald Trump's offending Catholics by posting AI images of himself as the pope, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=547.44s)]
*  right as Pope Francis passed away and everyone's in mourning. You're like, do I follow that one? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=553.44s)]
*  Or he'll go, we need to tariff movies. What do you even mean, tariffing movies? But a lot of that's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=561.2s)]
*  distraction. It doesn't mean necessarily that we don't cover it. But we have to stay focused [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=567.6s)]
*  on these things. And I'm sure as the attorney general of now, California is the fourth largest [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=572.96s)]
*  economy in the world. There are things that you see that you're probably like, stop with these [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  distractions. We need to focus on this, this, and this. I wish there was more media attention on [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=584.64s)]
*  this. So we have an audience of now 5 million subscribers. What issue or issues do you think [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=589.36s)]
*  we need to be focused on more that's not getting enough attention from you as the top law enforcement [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=594.64s)]
*  officer in California? I'll first say that you're right. There's this flood the zone approach, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=599.6s)]
*  shock and awe, high volume, high speed, and it is easy to be distracted. Unfortunately, many of these [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=606.56s)]
*  actions are dangerous and devastating. And a high number of them are unlawful. Our North Star, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=612.88s)]
*  as the attorney general, mine as the attorney general for the largest state department of justice [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=620.88s)]
*  in the nation, is identifying what is unlawful. When the president does something that is unlawful [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=625.36s)]
*  and harms California, that's when we act. And we don't necessarily get to set the agenda on that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=632.8s)]
*  We are responding to what he does. It's pretty simple. If Trump breaks the law, we sue him. If [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=639.68s)]
*  he doesn't break the law, we don't because there's nothing to sue him on. And this isn't about, we [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=644.96s)]
*  can't go to court with political grievance or ideological or policy difference. We'll get thrown [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=649.28s)]
*  out of court immediately. So we go to court when he breaks the law. And he's been, he's had patterns [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  of breaking the law here. He violates the separation of powers quite regularly. He wants to usurp and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  trespass on legislative authority, Congress's authority, particularly the power of the purse, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=666.56s)]
*  the power to appropriate and spend. He has done that many times. I think focusing on that attempt [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=670.8s)]
*  to violate the constitution and infringe upon a co-equal branch of government's authority is [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=677.84s)]
*  something to keep an eye on. He's also gone after rights and freedoms, including on day one, January [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=682.72s)]
*  20th, hours after he raised his hand and swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution, he went and violated [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=688.64s)]
*  it by issuing an executive order that sought to strike down and revoke birthright citizenship, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  a right that is right there in black and white in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=700.08s)]
*  the Citizenship Clause. If you're born on American soil, your U.S. citizen period, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=704.0s)]
*  full stop, doesn't matter with the immigration status or citizenship statuses of your parents. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=707.44s)]
*  So all of these cases at 19 is a lot, but they really break down into two major categories. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=713.36s)]
*  Either the president is trying to strip away someone's constitutional or other legally [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=719.36s)]
*  protected rights, or he's trying to withhold critical federal funding. In California's case, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=725.52s)]
*  to the tune of over $168 billion that he tried to revoke and withhold that we, through our actions, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=731.76s)]
*  have continued to make flow. The big oral argument on the birthright citizenship [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=737.6s)]
*  case is coming up on May 15th, right? The New Jersey attorney general, is he going to be the one [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=745.36s)]
*  making that argument? How do you pick who gets the oral argument? I mean, I'm sure, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=752.8s)]
*  do you get an oral argument coming soon? We're the fourth largest state by GDP. Why are we giving it [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  to Jersey? Yeah, I will say I am not arguing this case because I want to win this case. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=763.76s)]
*  So we have the New Jersey solicitor general, who is outstanding, and we have the most confidence in, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  the person in the New Jersey attorney general's office whose specialty is appellate advocacy, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=777.12s)]
*  who writes incredible appellate briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court and the circuit courts and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=782.48s)]
*  other appellate courts, and also can argue with great persuasion and skill. So we're confident in [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=788.48s)]
*  our advocate. We're confident in our case. The case is about the issue of a related and critical [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=795.84s)]
*  issue in the case, but not the actual substance of the constitutional right of birthright citizenship. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=803.2s)]
*  It's about national injunctions and whether a group of states who go to a court can get an order [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=809.04s)]
*  from the court, an injunction that applies throughout the whole nation as opposed to in [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=817.76s)]
*  their states. And this is a great case for us to be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on because [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=822.64s)]
*  this is about a U.S. constitutional right. And constitutional rights belong to all in the United [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=829.28s)]
*  States. They either apply to all of us or they apply to none of us. They don't apply [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=835.2s)]
*  to the people in blue states, but not the people in red states. So we think a national injunction [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  is very appropriate in this case, and we're looking forward to the argument and being able to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=844.24s)]
*  make a compelling and persuasive case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Well, I remember during former [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=848.72s)]
*  President Biden's administration that a lot of these MAGA attorneys would go right to the Northern [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  District of Texas, get nationwide injunctions that took away rights and freedoms that or [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=861.12s)]
*  took away things like student debt relief and things like that. So they were perfectly happy [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=867.6s)]
*  then, but now when it comes to protecting a constitutional right of birthright citizenship, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=873.04s)]
*  they go, foul, we don't want that. So, you know, we'd love to have you back on, Attorney General [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=879.52s)]
*  Bonta, to discuss with us after the case. I'd love to have a look back. So let us know there. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=885.28s)]
*  And I think we covered a lot. Anything else you wanted to say before we go? It's the first time [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=890.88s)]
*  on the Midas Tech Network. I'm honored and hopefully not the last. I'm grateful to have [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=894.32s)]
*  the opportunity to join you and talk to your amazing followers and audience. And one thing I [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=898.24s)]
*  do want to say to your point about the Republican attorneys general, they haven't filed one lawsuit [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=902.32s)]
*  given all of these unlawful actions that hurt their people, that hurt their constituents, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=907.76s)]
*  that strip away their constitutional rights and other federal rights, that pull away millions and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=911.36s)]
*  billions of dollars of already congressionally appropriated funding to their states. They're [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=916.08s)]
*  sitting on their hands and saying, this is fine, letting it happen. Meanwhile, you know, Speaker [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  Johnson and the Republicans in Congress are doing the same thing, letting the president run rough [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=926.88s)]
*  shot over their over their co-equal branch of government while they were asleep at the wheel. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=931.6s)]
*  And we need people with backbone and spine who stand up for the rule of law and for rights and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=938.0s)]
*  freedoms of Americans and to uphold the Constitution. And we are not getting that, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=943.68s)]
*  nor do we expect that from Republican AGs or the Republican Congress. But Democratic AGs are in the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=948.2399999999999s)]
*  House. And we believe we're the first and last line of defense when it comes to these unlawful [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=954.16s)]
*  attacks on Americans. And we are not backing down. We are not slowing down. We are immovable and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=958.4s)]
*  unapologetic in our commitment to each and every time the president of the United States of America [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=965.28s)]
*  breaks the law, we will take him to court to stop him and hold him accountable. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=971.12s)]
*  California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Thank you so much, Attorney General. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=975.76s)]
*  Honored to be with you. Thanks for having me. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ng_X-TJwss&t=980.5600000000001s)]
