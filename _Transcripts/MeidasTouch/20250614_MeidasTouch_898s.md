# FURIOUS King Charles DESTROYS Trump FOR PARADE
**MeidasTouch:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w)
*  You know, there was a 50-50 chance Donald Trump would actually dress like this to his dictator parade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a look at him right there in his little teeny tiny tank. Does that make you feel like a big boy, Donald? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=6.0s)]
*  Anyway, a real king, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, is apparently disgusted by Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=11.5s)]
*  And in a very statesman-like way, you have King Charles showing Donald Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=20.5s)]
*  what a real king looks like and how a real king is supposed to act. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=26.5s)]
*  And apparently King Charles just thinks it's utterly pathetic that Donald Trump needs to hold a dictator parade [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=31.0s)]
*  to make himself feel good about himself. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=39.0s)]
*  And it's funny because this article by Vanity Fair called King Charles, irked by Trump's Canada overtures, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=41.0s)]
*  sends his own political message with soft power. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=48.5s)]
*  It talks about how King Charles, since his diagnosis of cancer several months back, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=51.5s)]
*  has been trying to focus more on exercising soft power and political authority [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=57.5s)]
*  to just raise the profile of the monarchy and an evolving age as Donald Trump wants to be a mad king. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=65.5s)]
*  And the contrast between Charles and Trump cannot be more stark. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=76.0s)]
*  And the article goes on to basically show that King Charles is also almost intentionally drawing out this contrast. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=81.0s)]
*  And you saw it at first when Donald Trump invited Ukraine president Zelensky to the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=89.0s)]
*  And then Donald Trump started yelling at him and saying, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=95.5s)]
*  You don't hold the cards. You don't hold the cards. You're horrible. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=98.0s)]
*  What an embarrassing meeting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=101.5s)]
*  And then shortly thereafter, President Zelensky got this warm state welcome at the Royal Palace with King Charles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=104.0s)]
*  And King Charles treated Zelensky with respect. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=112.5s)]
*  And it was one of the first direct response gestures by King Charles to contrast himself to Donald Trump, the wannabe king. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=116.0s)]
*  And then, of course, there was the speech from the Crown by King Charles in Canada. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=126.0s)]
*  It was the first time you had a speech from the Crown since like the 1970s, since Queen Elizabeth gave her speech. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=131.5s)]
*  And King Charles really drew the contrast between Canada and between the Commonwealth and the 56 nations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=139.0s)]
*  that were formerly under British rule and the weakening of the United States of America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=148.0s)]
*  In other words, exalting the British Commonwealth and showing the United States as kind of very, very isolated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=154.0s)]
*  One of the things we know about Donald Trump, again, is his wannabe king behavior. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=161.5s)]
*  Like Donald Trump posted in response to this like weird gossipy article from the Sun. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=167.0s)]
*  Trump wrote, I love King Charles. Sounds good to me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=173.0s)]
*  This article was from March 20th of 2025. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=176.5s)]
*  The Trump card. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=179.5s)]
*  King Charles to make secret offer to Donald Trump during state visit after Keir Starmer hand-delivered letter from the king. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=181.0s)]
*  The move could symbolize Britain's close relationship with the US. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=189.5s)]
*  And this bizarre article from March 20th, 2025 from the Sun, it's got this like funny picture of like King Charles as though he's scheming, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=194.0s)]
*  is basically saying that the United States should be sub should basically be a subject of the throne [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=202.0s)]
*  and become a member of the Commonwealth and basically pledge loyalty to King Charles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=209.0s)]
*  And so if you go look at what Donald Trump reposted, Trump reposted, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=215.5s)]
*  King Charles is said to have made a secret offer to Donald Trump during a state visit after Starmer hand-delivered him a letter from the king. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=220.5s)]
*  And Donald Trump like reposted that favor favorably like I love King Charles. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=228.5s)]
*  How great is how great is this right here? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=233.0s)]
*  So again, this Vanity Fair article goes on to talk about how Donald Trump is going to be doing the dictator parade. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=237.0s)]
*  How King Charles and how there's going to be the no King's protest and then how King Charles, the real king is exercising soft power. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=245.0s)]
*  I mean, if you just think about the lead up to this Donald Trump dictator parade, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=254.0s)]
*  just look at what was going on yesterday and just how utterly embarrassing this is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=260.0s)]
*  as you have these soldiers rehearsing for Donald Trump's wasteful military parade here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=266.0s)]
*  Just play this clip. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=271.0s)]
*  Now, yesterday also a soldier died in the lead up to Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=275.0s)]
*  Donald Trump made no statements about the death of this soldier. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=299.0s)]
*  At first, it was believed that the soldier died preparing for Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=303.5s)]
*  Although the 101st Airborne Division said we actually want to clarify our statement. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=308.5s)]
*  The accident occurred during a routine aviation training mission inside Fort Campbell. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=314.5s)]
*  And it just so happened that it was the day before Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=319.5s)]
*  So but who knows? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=324.5s)]
*  I mean, at this point, the Trump regime lies about everything. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=325.5s)]
*  And you can see Donald Trump, who's called our dead soldiers suckers and losers before sending a message to the base. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=329.0s)]
*  Because the first story that was reported was in preparation for the Army's 250th birthday. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=336.0s)]
*  It is with deep sorrow that we share the loss of our teammate, a soldier named Dustin Wright. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=343.0s)]
*  The official release is included below. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=350.0s)]
*  And it clearly says in preparation for the Army's 250th birthday. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=352.5s)]
*  That's referring to Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=356.5s)]
*  And they had to pull back the statement. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=359.5s)]
*  Our heart goes out to Dustin Wright and Dustin Wright's family for his death. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=361.0s)]
*  He's identified as the soldier who died as a result of wounds from the AH-64 Apache helicopter training accident at Fort Campbell. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=367.5s)]
*  And we do know that those helicopters are going to be used in the dictator parade. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=376.5s)]
*  So you can assess and judge for yourself what you think is going to be happening there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=381.0s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump was asked about the several no-kings protests planned across the country earlier in the weekend. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=387.0s)]
*  Here is what he said. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=395.0s)]
*  There are several no-kings protests planned across the country on Saturday as well. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=397.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on those? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=402.0s)]
*  What are they going to do? No kings? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=403.0s)]
*  No kings. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=404.0s)]
*  I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=405.0s)]
*  A king would say, I'm not going to get this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=408.5s)]
*  A king would have never had the California mandate to even be talking to him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=411.5s)]
*  He wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, fellas, you got to pull this off. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=415.5s)]
*  And after years, we get it done. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=420.0s)]
*  No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all. Thank you very much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=422.0s)]
*  And again, you can see Donald Trump's obsession with kings. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=425.5s)]
*  Like this was a month or so ago where Donald Trump kept on talking about how he loves to take kings and queens and dictators. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=428.5s)]
*  Into the Oval Office. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=438.0s)]
*  When you add up the importance, I take people into the Oval Office and the biggest people, foreign leaders, princes, kings, queens, and presidents, and prime ministers, a couple of dictators, I guess. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=440.0s)]
*  They don't say that. They say, no, I'm a prime minister or I'm a president. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=454.0s)]
*  And I say, no, you're a dictator, but that's okay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=458.0s)]
*  The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature has a huge impact on your sleep quality. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=461.0s)]
*  If you wake up too hot or too cold, I highly recommend that you check out Miracle Maid's bed sheets. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=466.5s)]

*  And here's what he said delivering the speech. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=583.5s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=586.5s)]
*  My dear late mother Queen Elizabeth II opened a new Canadian parliament in 1957. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=589.0s)]
*  The Second World War remained a fresh painful memory. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=596.0s)]
*  The Cold War was intensifying. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=601.0s)]
*  Freedom and democracy were under threat. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=604.0s)]
*  Canada was emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=607.0s)]
*  In the decades since, history has been punctuated by epoch making events. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=615.5s)]
*  The Vietnam War, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the start of the war on terror. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=622.5s)]
*  Today, Canada faces another critical moment. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=629.5s)]
*  Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=636.0s)]
*  And ones which the government is determined to protect. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=647.0s)]
*  The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades is changing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aylW1l5k_2w&t=654.0s)]
