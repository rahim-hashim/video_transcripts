# PANICKED Trump gets UNGLUED as PROTESTS GROW
**MeidasTouch:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA)
*  Those are tanks rolling through Washington DC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's America looks like as he federalizes the National Guard [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=9.68s)]
*  and sends the Marines into Los Angeles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=15.5s)]
*  As Donald Trump gave a speech yesterday in front of active troops at Fort Bragg where [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=19.12s)]
*  Donald Trump egged them on to boo the city of Los Angeles, part of the country that they've [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=26.4s)]
*  sworn an oath to protect as he egged on active troops, active members of the military to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=33.8s)]
*  boo the media. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=41.4s)]
*  He's got tanks rolling through Washington DC. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=43.56s)]
*  So I ask you, choose your fighter. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=46.4s)]
*  You've got California Governor Gavin Newsom, or you've got Donald Trump and Steven Chung, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=50.08s)]
*  who's Donald Trump's communication director, who makes posts like this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=56.92s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's communications director. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=62.12s)]
*  This guy works in the White House. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=65.78s)]
*  He's Donald Trump's main mouthpiece. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=68.12s)]
*  Just take a look at how he talks and communicates. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=71.16s)]
*  Talk shit, get hit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=75.12s)]
*  What's he responding to? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=78.44s)]
*  The fact that Terry Moran, one of the correspondents at ABC, got fired. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=80.4s)]
*  His agreement was terminated by ABC, which is owned by Disney, because Terry Moran made [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=87.8s)]
*  a post criticizing Stephen Miller, Donald Trump's top advisor, and Donald Trump for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=95.52s)]
*  not having a heart because they are ripping families apart and relishing in the suffering [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=102.56s)]
*  of migrants who are not criminals. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=109.88s)]
*  Wow, a political correspondent like Terry Moran at ABC, who gave probably the best interview [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=112.48s)]
*  of Donald Trump I had seen of really anybody who's interviewed Donald Trump, he had the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=119.2s)]
*  audacity the other night to make a post saying that Trump and Miller have no heart. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=124.56s)]
*  Boom, immediately fired. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=130.88s)]
*  The regime, because America's not a democracy, I call him a regime, the Trump regime, calls [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=133.04s)]
*  up ABC. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=139.14s)]
*  They say you fire the guy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=140.62s)]
*  Boom, he's gone. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=142.24s)]
*  And then Stephen Chung, this guy, says talk shit, get hit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=144.2s)]
*  So then Donald Trump, as I mentioned, spoke in front of active troops at Fort Bragg yesterday [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=150.76s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=157.32s)]
*  Here he goads the troops into booing the, quote, fake news covering the event. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=159.16s)]
*  So we have our military in uniform booing the free press. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=165.26s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  And for a little news for the fake news back there, the fake news, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  look at them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=177.12s)]
*  Look at them all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=178.12s)]
*  Oh, what I have to put up with. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=179.12s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=181.2s)]
*  What I have to put up with. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=182.2s)]
*  But they're all right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=186.72s)]
*  They've been very nice today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=188.48s)]
*  They were impressed with that display, I can tell you that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it took them a little by surprise. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=192.64s)]
*  So I ask you again, choose your fighter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=194.92s)]
*  That guy, that fascist, terrorist, felon criminal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=200.44s)]
*  Yeah, we don't mince words on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=205.2s)]
*  We just say what he is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=208.2s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=209.2s)]
*  He's convicted of felonies. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=210.2s)]
*  He's a sexual abuser. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=212.32s)]
*  He's found liable of sexual abuse. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=214.2s)]
*  He's Epstein's buddy, hung out with Epstein. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=216.52s)]
*  He said Epstein's a great guy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  He's all over Epstein's phone log and Epstein's flight log. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=220.08s)]
*  We know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=223.8s)]
*  We know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  Call him out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  Call him out for it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  He's a fraud. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  He's found liable for fraud. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  He's a bankruptor. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  He's a loser. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=231.68s)]
*  We call him out. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  Pick your fighter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  That guy or California Governor Gavin Newsom, who gave an exclusive address to the nation [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  and to the state of California last night. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=242.58s)]
*  We had the exclusive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=244.54s)]
*  We were so honored here at the Midas Touch Network to get that exclusive of California [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=246.54s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=251.06s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=253.18s)]
*  Thanks to our law enforcement officers and the majority of Angelenos who protested peacefully, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=254.18s)]
*  the situation was winding down and was concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=260.5s)]
*  But that's not what Donald Trump wanted. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=266.82s)]
*  He again chose escalation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=270.2s)]
*  He chose more force. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=272.42s)]
*  He chose theatrics over public safety. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=274.38s)]
*  He federalized another 2,000 guard members. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=277.18s)]
*  He deployed more than 700 active U.S. Marines. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=280.44s)]
*  These are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  We honor their service. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=290.76s)]
*  We honor their bravery. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=292.04s)]
*  But we do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces, not in LA, not in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=294.08s)]
*  California, not anywhere. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=299.78s)]
*  So I ask you again, choose your fighter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  That clip I just showed you of California Governor Gavin Newsom or Donald Trump's top [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=305.24s)]
*  adviser Stephen Miller. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=310.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller was running for student government in high school. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  His speech was apparently the janitors really made him angry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=316.66s)]
*  And he always had hate in his heart. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=323.76s)]
*  And he gave this speech saying, and these janitors, I'm going to throw my food on the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  floor and watch them clean it up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=330.72s)]
*  Watch what Stephen Miller says in high school. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=333.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=335.44s)]
*  Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=336.44s)]
*  And we have plenty of janitors who are paying that huge sum. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=343.44s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump yesterday during a disastrous Oval Office press conference where he said, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=346.76s)]
*  If anybody protests my military parade, my dictator parade over the weekend, over the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=352.6s)]
*  weekend, excuse me, over the weekend, they will be met with heavy force. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=360.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=366.24s)]
*  Celebrating big on Saturday, we're going to have a lot of, and if there's any protest [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=367.24s)]
*  that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  By the way, for those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=373.56s)]
*  big force. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=377.12s)]
*  And I haven't even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=378.12s)]
*  country, but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=382.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of the definition of dictatorship right there, isn't it? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=386.08s)]
*  Isn't that the definition? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=391.4s)]
*  If you protest, I'm going to attack you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=392.8s)]
*  What in the Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin is that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=396.08s)]
*  We're so much better than that, America. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=399.96s)]
*  We really are. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=401.36s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of people who have hate in their hearts who vote for that guy, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=402.36s)]
*  but let's just be normal human beings with empathy, love and respect and decency. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=405.88s)]
*  Let's act like grownups. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's act like adults. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=413.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's call it out when Donald Trump is giving this press conference where he said [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=415.0s)]
*  that was supposed to be about FEMA. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=420.48s)]
*  And what was Donald Trump's message about FEMA? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=423.36s)]
*  We want to wean off FEMA. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  We shouldn't, as the federal government, have to deal with FEMA. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=429.2s)]
*  It should be a governor's issue or a state government issue. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=436.62s)]
*  We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=437.62s)]
*  A little bit like education, we're moving it back to the states so the governors can [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=442.22s)]
*  handle it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=447.14s)]
*  That's why they're governors now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=448.14s)]
*  If they can't handle it, they shouldn't be governor. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=449.14s)]
*  But these governors can handle it and they'll work in conjunction with other governors. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=451.3s)]
*  They'll give each other a hand. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=455.14s)]

*  Like Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, is a Congress member from Louisiana. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=459.74s)]
*  Like 18 billion for Hurricane Katrina. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  FEMA brought in about 78 billion dollars of resources. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=470.09999999999997s)]

*  The purpose of the federal government is to supplement and basically help the states. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=491.86s)]
*  There are states' rights and then the federal government is supposed to work with the states [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=497.54s)]

*  Think for Donald Trump, he views the federal government as a tool of the dictatorship. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=505.06s)]
*  I guess that's what all the Republicans meant by states' rights. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=509.54s)]
*  I guess for them states' rights really just meant when we get our dictator in, he'll invade [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=512.62s)]

*  like Virginia Jouffre, underage girls, and bring them to Epstein. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=572.26s)]
*  Virginia Jouffre was unhoused, homeless, was working at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=576.4200000000001s)]

*  You gotta do it right away. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=613.06s)]
*  Trump's amplifying, escalating the dictator stuff. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=615.5799999999999s)]
*  Apparently now they're going back to their Guantanamo plan and they're gonna start sending [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=619.5s)]
*  9,000 people. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=624.74s)]
*  The Trump regime is planning to dramatically ramp up sending undocumented migrants to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=626.9s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay, starting this week with at least 9,000 people being vetted for transfer, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=630.82s)]
*  according to documents by Politico. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=636.7s)]
*  That would be an exponential increase from the roughly 500 migrants who have been held [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  for short periods of time at the base since February and a major step toward realizing [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=642.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump's plan announced in January to hold 30,000 migrants. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=648.5400000000001s)]
*  But you see how they kind of nonchalantly just talk about that, just throwing people [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=653.82s)]
*  in concentration camps in Guantanamo Bay, which used to be reserved for the worst of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=660.02s)]
*  the worst terrorists. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=665.34s)]
*  And even then the Supreme Court said that they had due process rights. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=666.34s)]
*  That's what the United States of America is and absolutely should not be. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=670.9399999999999s)]

*  I'll just show you a small portion of it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=687.3s)]
*  Eating meatpacking factories, people hard at work, and throwing them in ICE trucks and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=689.8s)]

*  I mean, it pains me to talk about that. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=719.8s)]
*  It pains me to show you that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  It's horrible stuff. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=726.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're learning that just so far already what the Pentagon expects Donald Trump [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  deploying the Marines and National Guard to LA, it's going to cost $134 million already. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to be significantly more than that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=744.5s)]
*  That's why I've been saying over and over again, I don't believe for a second that military [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=747.3s)]
*  parade over the weekend is only going to cost, what do they say, $45 million total BS. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  They are downplaying that number. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=760.3599999999999s)]
*  Just think about it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  They have thousands of tanks, hundreds of helicopters and airplanes, and they're shutting [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=763.6999999999999s)]
*  down Washington DC. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=770.92s)]
*  They've got gates everywhere. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=772.62s)]
*  They're bringing in thousands of troops to march in the street like a Kim Jong-un dictator [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=774.16s)]
*  style parade. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=779.86s)]
*  And you're telling me that that's going to cost $45 million. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=781.76s)]
*  I think it's going to cost like half a billion dollars. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=785.12s)]
*  And I think they're hiding the costs. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=787.8399999999999s)]
*  That's my suspicion. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=789.4s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=790.86s)]
*  But if this operation so far is $134 million, what do you think that's going to cost? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=791.86s)]
*  As Carl Quintanilla also says, escalating to de-escalate. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said in an interview [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=801.28s)]
*  with CBS's Face the Nation that a goal of the talks with China would be to get shipments [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=806.42s)]
*  of rare earth minerals from China to flow just as they did before the beginning of April, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=812.92s)]
*  as Ryan Grim says. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  So we started a trade war and are now figuring out what we can offer just to get back to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=821.28s)]
*  where we were before we started the trade war. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=827.82s)]
*  And then yesterday, and I'll leave you with this, that the Trump regime announced that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=832.2s)]
*  they had some breakthrough in the talks with China in London. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=837.82s)]
*  And they announced that they have developed a framework to implement the consensus that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=842.2800000000001s)]
*  was reached on May 12th. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=849.1s)]
*  Just look at this language right here. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=851.46s)]
*  This is how it's being reported. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=853.4200000000001s)]
*  US and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a two days of intense talks, intense, here in London, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=854.66s)]
*  with what they said was a framework to get their trade truce back on track and ratchet [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=861.38s)]
*  down tensions between the two biggest economies. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=866.62s)]
*  Okay, so as Justin Wolfer says, so the US and Chinese trade negotiators have negotiated [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=870.18s)]
*  a handshake agreement to seek sign off to agree that they previously agreed agreement [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=877.34s)]
*  is still their agreed upon agreement. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=884.94s)]
*  But that agreement is not an agreement, but a framework for seeking future agreements. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=887.94s)]
*  It's a concept of a deals concept. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=895.1s)]
*  And that is where we are today. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WRONY43lZA&t=898.38s)]
