# Trump gets NEWS HE FEARED this AM as PROTESTS RAGE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ)
*  Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That was one of the thousands of protests in the United States and across the world right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=6.88s)]
*  Hands-off protests against the Trump regime that was in Concord, New Hampshire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=12.56s)]
*  Now we're seeing millions of people in the aggregate in the United States and across the world [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=19.2s)]
*  protesting the Trump regime. That is what Trump is waking up to today as he is once again golfing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  in Florida as Americans are out there on the streets protesting. Donald Trump, bunker boy, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=33.6s)]
*  is golfing away. This was the front page of the Wall Street Journal this morning. Market carnage [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=41.36s)]
*  worsens. You see a straight line basically down. That's the markets crashing right there, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=48.8s)]
*  and then this photo on the Wall Street Journal owned by Rupert Murdoch is a photo of Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=54.88s)]
*  golfing or heading to golf. Trump heads to golf amid tariff turmoil. That is what Murdoch even [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  thinks about Trump right now as well. Let me just take you here to Boston where there's over a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  100,000 protesters in the hands-off protests there courtesy of Rob Way. Here's about 100,000 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=77.04s)]
*  protesters in Boston. Let's take a look at what's going down there. Let's play the clip. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=84.64s)]
*  Now let me give a shout out to a bunch of the other protests taking place like the protest [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=105.6s)]
*  in Fort Lauderdale. Let's talk about the protests taking place in Germany. Let's talk about the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=110.8s)]
*  protests in London. We could talk about the protests in Portland, Maine, the protest in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Cincinnati, in Buffalo, in Winchester, Virginia, in Columbus, Ohio, in Asheville, North Carolina, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  in Duluth, Minnesota, in Pennsylvania, in Brussels, Belgium. There are protests. Obviously, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=127.52s)]
*  I'm going to be missing cities and countries and locations and towns, but I want to highlight all [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=134.24s)]
*  the people who have been tagging me on those. We'll be doing more coverage, of course, in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=140.0s)]
*  morning on these protests, but shout out to everyone everywhere protesting the Trump regime. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=145.04s)]
*  So what's Donald Trump posting while he's golfing right now? The following. Big business is not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=151.2s)]
*  worried about tariffs because they know they are here to stay, but they are focused on the big, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=156.48s)]
*  beautiful deal, which will supercharge our economy. Very important going on right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=162.24s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posted this this morning. China has been hit much harder than the USA, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=167.2s)]
*  not even close. They and many other nations have treated us unsustainably badly. We have been the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=171.6s)]
*  dumb and helpless whipping post, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=177.92s)]
*  like never before. Already more than $5 trillion of investment and rising fast. This is an economic [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=183.44s)]
*  revolution and we will win. Hang tough. It won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  will. Then he puts us all in caps. Make America great again. Exclamation point, exclamation point, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=195.76s)]
*  exclamation point. Literally a demented individual, right? Demented Donald. They're golfing, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=199.44s)]
*  saying it ain't going to be easy. Hang tough, everybody. While I inflict and me and Elon Musk [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=205.44s)]
*  inflict pain and suffering, but business is going to love this, by the way, as the MAGA Republicans [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  in the Senate were working overtime to bring $5 trillion in tax cuts to billionaires as Donald [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump is tanking our markets. Hey, Donald, you promised that on day one you are going to bring [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=225.28s)]
*  prices down. There are going to be so many jobs. You're not going to know what to do with them. You [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=230.16s)]
*  also promised that there would be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours, that housing would be affordable [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=232.88s)]
*  right away. Also, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. You promised all of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=237.44s)]
*  those things right away and all you're doing is crashing the economy and making the world [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=242.8s)]
*  far less stable and destroying America's alliances abroad. By the way, Donald Trump sent the following [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=247.36s)]
*  email to his supporters. I subscribe to this email list so you don't have to. Do you want a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=253.84s)]
*  Doge check? Tell me here. Would you take a check, Ben? I'll even sign it. I'm proposing something [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=260.24s)]
*  completely unprecedented. 5,000 Doge dividend checks. Tell me you want one. It's your money, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=267.52s)]
*  anyway. I'm just giving it back to you. It's why I call this presidency the rug poll or Ponzi scheme [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=274.4s)]
*  presidency. Just pull the rug over you and like a Ponzi scheme, they just do it again and again [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=280.56s)]
*  and again. Now that they know that they're taking people's pensions, life savings and 401k's, I'm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=285.76s)]
*  going to give you a $5,000 check. You want me to give you some money? Will you beg for it, Ben? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=290.4s)]
*  Please beg for it and maybe I'll give you a $5,000 Doge check that I'm never going to give you and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  then I'm going to come up with my next Ponzi scheme as I pickpocket you and give the money [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=300.0s)]
*  to the billionaires. Yeah, we know what you're doing. That's why there are millions of people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=304.24s)]
*  protesting in the United States of America and throughout the world. By the way, why? Now that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=308.08s)]
*  the Midas Touch Network is the biggest and has the most views of any news network in the world, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=312.56s)]
*  that's why we're covering these protests as well. Live all day here on the Midas Touch Network, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=318.08s)]
*  exactly as the people wanted, even though corporate news is not covering it the way they should. Okay, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=323.12s)]
*  let's take a look at this also, this article from the Wall Street Journal today. Americans were [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=327.76s)]
*  souring on Trump's economic plans even before Trump's tariff bloodbath. A majority of voters [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=332.72s)]
*  oppose Trump's levies on important goods and disapproved of how he is handling inflation and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=339.6s)]
*  prices. The polls suggest that the president who promised that tariffs are about making America [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=345.04s)]
*  rich again is facing unease. That's an understatement right there. What are the Trump influencers like [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=349.68s)]
*  Benny Johnson saying? Well, they're saying this. Losing money means nothing. Digital ones and zeros. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=355.68s)]
*  In the end, you won't miss any of it. Seriously, that's the message from the Trump influencers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=362.96s)]
*  Digital ones and zeros, as Tom Nichols says, spoken like someone with money who won't retire [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=369.36s)]
*  for another 40 years anyway. No one hates the working class now like the mag worlds, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=374.88s)]
*  Carl Quintanilla posts. The coming weeks are going to be a big rolling crash of platitudes, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=380.88s)]
*  or we can say Trump propaganda and lies versus reality. We're seeing multiple companies that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=387.12s)]
*  were preparing IPOs, now no longer preparing IPOs. We're seeing companies pausing their exports into [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=392.24s)]
*  the United States. We're seeing factories shut down, as Carl Quintanilla reports as well, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=398.88s)]
*  via Apollo's slide deck this AM. It's not just about the tariffs. The risks that we're seeing, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=404.32s)]
*  the harm to the economy also includes consumer confidence, the lowest ever. Corporate confidence, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=410.48s)]
*  almost the lowest ever. Negative impact of tariffs, earnings on our GDP as well. Negative impact of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  retaliation, including less tourism into the United States. For example, the Canada boycott of all US [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=422.16s)]
*  tourism is now 75 to 85%. Canadians are not coming to the US. By the way, in addition to Donald Trump [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  threatening to annex and invade it, also if you show up at the United States, you might end up in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  an ICE detention center or a concentration camp in El Salvador, and then once you're sent there, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=438.8s)]
*  the Trump regime will tell federal courts in the United States, like they did last week with [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=443.92s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, oopsies, oopsies, nothing we can do. Go tell Naib Bukele. Maybe he can help out. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=447.76s)]
*  That's literally what the Trump regime's response is. After writing oopsies, we sent wrong people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=453.92s)]
*  to concentration camps in El Salvador. Elbows up, Canada. Elbows up, world. Hands off, Donald, of our [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=458.48s)]
*  country. Also, don't forget the Doge layoffs of federal workers, how that's going to cause [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=465.44s)]
*  significant harm and make us less safe here and abroad. Negative impact of a $6 trillion decline [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=470.08s)]
*  in the S&P. Let me bring you to the protest in Washington, DC that we're covering here on the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=475.76s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. Over 100,000 people protesting in DC. Democratic Congress member [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=480.4s)]
*  Jamie Raskin speaking at the protest. Let's take a look. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=485.52s)]
*  Fire. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=516.24s)]
*  Now belong in the nonfiction section. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=530.96s)]
*  We even got the right to call the president deranged for crashing our economy, destroying [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=536.0s)]
*  $6 trillion of wealth and turning 5401K into a 201K. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=542.88s)]
*  By the way, remember when we flagged for everybody as well two months ago? The following. Hedge funds [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=550.16s)]
*  are betting big that the stock market is going to suffer a devastating crash due to Donald Trump. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=555.92s)]
*  Data from Goldman Sachs is sending shockwaves through financial circles revealing a dramatic [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=561.36s)]
*  surge in short positions against the U.S. stock market. First reported in Daily Mail, we flagged [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=566.24s)]
*  that for everybody saying look at what they're saying. Also remember during the election we [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=571.76s)]
*  flagged what Donald Trump and Elon Musk were saying privately. We were doing exposés on it while [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=575.76s)]
*  corporate media was saying everyone's going to get so rich under Donald Trump. Remember we said [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=580.96s)]
*  privately in Mar-a-Lago we hear they're saying that they want to inflict economic hardship. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=585.04s)]
*  Remember and they're also saying publicly too on some clips. Yeah, hardship is necessary, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=590.48s)]
*  hardship is needed. But look, this was from the economist before the handover, former president [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=594.16s)]
*  Biden to Donald Trump. We were the envy of the world, America's economy, the envy of the world [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=600.24s)]
*  at that time. But you know who would have ever thought that someone like Donald Trump who's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=606.0s)]
*  bankrupted literally everything said, not literally most things in his entire life, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=609.52s)]
*  casino stakes and whatever, the university, you know someone who's been found civilly liable for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=614.8s)]
*  fraud and making up financial valuations, someone who's a convicted felon for business records [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=622.16s)]
*  fraud, someone who is a sexual predator found liable for sexual assault. I don't know, someone [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=628.48s)]
*  who led an insurrection against the country. Who could have expected that someone like this hates [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=633.84s)]
*  our country and would try to inflict this pain on our country. But hey Donald, while you're golfing, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=640.32s)]
*  we the people are rising up. The place to watch it is here on the Midas Touch Network, the network [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU7OA8ZkLQ&t=644.8000000000001s)]
