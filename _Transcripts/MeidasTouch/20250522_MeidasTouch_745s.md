# MAGA Mike SURRENDERS on Pledge as DISASTER GROWS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA)
*  You know, the market volatility we're seeing right now is not normal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=0.0s)]
*  In my view, the economy of the United States of America should not look like a Trump meme stock. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=4.32s)]
*  And we know with Trump meme stocks that there are a group of insiders who are usually the ones benefiting. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=11.76s)]
*  I mean, I think it's 22 of the crypto wallets made money on the Trump meme stuff, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=17.92s)]
*  while like 50,000 people ended up losing money. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  So when I see this in our markets, it really pisses me off. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=28.32s)]
*  And then layer on top of that, all the unusual trading patterns around when Trump announces tariffs, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=30.8s)]
*  when he takes off the tariffs, you see all of this activity that at least resembles insider trading. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=37.44s)]
*  And then it pisses me off to no end when you see that members of Congress are involved in trading these stocks [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  and making huge amounts of money off it and doing weird trades that would never otherwise exist [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  unless you had some knowledge about what the heck was taking place. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=57.04s)]
*  And we showed the photo there of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a rapacious stock trader, all of a sudden. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=60.4s)]
*  But look, let's be clear. It's a bipartisan issue in my view. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=66.16s)]
*  I think that public servants should be public servants. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=70.0s)]
*  And so even though Mike Johnson has, you know, he's claimed to some extent that he's against [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  stock trading by members of Congress, I guess, but who knows what the hell he says is true or not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  But then he gave this weird press conference also where he said, well, I don't like this stock trading, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=83.76s)]
*  but I have sympathy. I get it. Members of Congress, they're not making enough money. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=87.92s)]
*  They need this. They need stock trading. I get it. Here's what he said. Let's play. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=92.4s)]
*  Well, look, you know, the salary of Congress has been frozen since 2009. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=96.72000000000001s)]
*  You know, when you adjust for inflation, a member of Congress today is making 31% less than they made [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  in that year. It goes down every year. And over time, if you stay on this trajectory, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=106.0s)]
*  you're going to have less qualified people who are willing to make the extreme sacrifice to run [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  for Congress. I mean, it's just people just make a reasonable decision as a family on whether or not [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  they can come and move to Washington, have a residence here, residence at home and do all the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  things that are required. So the counter argument is, and I have some sympathy, look, at least let [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=124.32s)]
*  them like engage in some stock trading so that they can continue to, you know, take care of their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=129.68s)]
*  family. Let's bring in Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, who today, along with Senator Ossoff, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=136.16s)]
*  introduced the Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act as well. Tell us about everything. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=142.72s)]
*  Well, Ben, let me start off by saying I have zero sympathy. Zero. I mean, Mike Johnson, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=149.28s)]
*  a speaker of the House, he can work to raise the salary of members of Congress. These things are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=155.04s)]
*  totally unconnected. When you're in this job, you get enormous access to information. I sit on the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=162.16s)]
*  Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. There are people on the Ad Committee that know [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=169.52s)]
*  what's going on with, you know, with crops and cattle and could use that information to trade [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=174.48s)]
*  futures. I do believe there is somebody that sits on the Senate Ad Committee. I'm not going to name [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=182.0s)]
*  names here, but does actually trade future contracts for agricultural products. So with this access to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=187.44s)]
*  information, I imagine there is a temptation by members of Congress to use this information to gain, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=196.16s)]
*  to just build their wealth. And that is not right. That's not information that the general public has. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=205.92s)]
*  I get the issue that Mike Johnson has with the salaries of members of Congress. He is the speaker [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=213.2s)]
*  of the freaking House of Representatives, and he could do something about that. And I think there [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=219.84s)]
*  should be something done. Folks that have been here for a long time because of inflation, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=224.72s)]
*  buying power has been reduced. I'm sympathetic to that argument. So Ossoff and I, Senator Ossoff and I [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=233.44s)]
*  reintroduced our legislation to basically compel the rest of Congress to do what the two of us do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=240.24s)]
*  And that's putting your assets into a blind trust where you don't have the ability to use any of the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  information you have to make money because of your job. We're supposed to be public servants here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=255.04s)]
*  And Senator Ossoff and I take this very seriously. You could also diversify. And, you know, so there's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=261.68s)]
*  another option there, too. But we want this to be the rule for all 535 members of Congress. In the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=267.52s)]
*  Senate, as far as I know, it's just the two of us that have taken these steps in the House. I'm not [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=274.24s)]
*  sure how many people. But this needs to happen. And there is bipartisan support for this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=280.24s)]
*  You know, we see what's going on with the House, though, and the budget. And we see what's going on, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=286.32s)]
*  you know, with some of your colleagues in the Senate. You know, the focus seems to be, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=291.76s)]
*  I don't know, cruelty seems to be the point with, you know, with this budget. And I guess, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=298.48s)]
*  enriching the billionaires. I think the second part is really the point. I think it's the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=304.32s)]
*  enriching the billionaires. It's making sure that they don't have to pay more taxes if we got, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=310.56s)]
*  if Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts went away. And these are the guys that are supposed to be, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  you know, the fiscal conservatives. They're going to add trillions of dollars of debt, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=322.8s)]
*  you know, to the, well, to the deficit and to the ultimately to the national debt in order to give, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  put more money in the pockets of rich people. The cruelty part comes in where they're trying [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=335.92s)]
*  to make it not look so bad. Instead of adding six trillion, it'll be only four trillion. So [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=340.64s)]
*  they can feel a little bit better about it. But to do that, they're going to kick people off their [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=346.64s)]
*  health care. And kids aren't going to get meals. I mean, that's the cruel part is hungry kids are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=351.2s)]
*  going to continue to go hungry. So rich people can pay less in taxes. And I'll say this, Ben, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=358.96s)]
*  you know, I had some teachers in here today with some kids from schools in Arizona. And [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=367.28s)]
*  these teachers pay a higher percentage of their income in federal taxes than many, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=376.24s)]
*  many billionaires and millionaires. I mean, Warren Buffett is a guy who pointed this out all the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=383.36s)]
*  time, the secretary paid a higher percentage of taxes than he did. And I think that is that that's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=387.68s)]
*  true. And it's a problem. And we got to fix it. They're doing the opposite thing here. They're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=394.88s)]
*  making this situation worse. You know, there was a moment, I thought it was a month or so ago, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=399.68s)]
*  where Donald Trump had some tech billionaires in the Oval Office, and he was asked a question [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=404.56s)]
*  about profiting off of his own mean coins. And he looked at the billionaires. And he said, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=409.36s)]
*  well, they're very rich. Why shouldn't I be rich? And it feels like these MAGA Republican Congress [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=413.76s)]
*  members who hang out at Mar-a-Lago, see all these billionaires and doing all the things that they're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=419.84s)]
*  doing and saying, you know what, me too, I deserve that as well. Look at what I'm doing for them. I [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=424.72s)]
*  want to be rich like them. And the greed trickles down to all of the MAGA Republicans, but the wealth [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=431.44000000000005s)]
*  doesn't trickle down to the rest of the Americans. No, and a lot of envy, I think, among these [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  billionaires. I mean, we have a whole different class of billionaires now. It used to be if you [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=444.48s)]
*  were worth a billion or two or three, you were incredibly wealthy. Now we have folks that are [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=448.88000000000005s)]
*  worth 50, 60, 100, $150 billion and more. I mean, Elon Musk is somewhere north of that. I don't keep [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=454.0s)]
*  track of how rich the guy is. Or Zuckerberg or others are just so incredibly wealthy that I think [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=461.36s)]
*  there's a lot of envy from the poorer billionaires. The reality of the situation is that the wealth [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=468.24s)]
*  has moved from, you know, predominantly the people around the middle income in our country used to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=474.72s)]
*  own an enormous amount of wealth collectively. And a lot of that wealth has been transferred [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=483.44s)]
*  to the people in the top 0.1%. It's not sustainable. It means the buying power of people in the middle [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=488.56s)]
*  has gone down dramatically. These are folks that are having to deal with rising costs. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=496.16s)]
*  Billionaires don't have to deal with, you know, the price of groceries going up or housing. It [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=500.88s)]
*  doesn't matter to them. And this trend is unsustainable. Billionaires can pay more in taxes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=505.28s)]
*  They can do it right now. And then we don't have to kick kids off of their health care. And we can [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=513.28s)]
*  continue to give them, you know, free lunch and school when they can't afford to bring lunch money. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=519.28s)]
*  So that's what we're talking about here. It's taking money. I mean, physically taking money [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=525.84s)]
*  from the people that can least afford it and putting it in the pockets of the wealthiest [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=531.68s)]
*  Americans. And that's just not right. Well, I got John, I got to ask you a national security [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=536.88s)]
*  question, of course, which is Trump's trip to the Middle East, I think just a stain on the United [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=541.52s)]
*  States, you know, when he was doing in Qatar and United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=547.12s)]
*  We know that the Pentagon formally accepted the free gold plated Qatari jet. But we're even seeing [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=553.12s)]
*  with the president of South Africa, President Ramaphosa, who was in the Oval Office today, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=560.24s)]
*  basically saying, I'm sorry that I can't get you a jet, if that's going to influence you, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=565.2s)]
*  you know, and just seeing how it is that the international community is now perceiving us, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  seeing China hosting that meeting last week with the Latin American and Caribbean countries, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  projecting itself now as a stabilizing force and speaking the way America once spoke as America [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=582.0s)]
*  under Trump sounds like China used to speak and me as an American saying, what the hell is happening [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=588.16s)]
*  here? It's gone upside down. What do you what's your observations of it from all the national [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=593.6s)]
*  security experience you have? Well, you're right, Ben. The big problem is China is going to step [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=599.68s)]
*  into this this vacuum. This, you know, a place where we were the most, you know, ethical. We [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  were the leaders of the free world. We helped other countries when they were in need. It didn't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=613.28s)]
*  cost us a tremendous amount of money. We fed starving kids on the other side of the planet [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  just because they were starving. And and the programs that we I was in South Africa last year, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=625.12s)]
*  and President Bush's PEPFAR program has saved more lives than probably any federal government [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=632.24s)]
*  program the United States government has ever supported was George Bush's program. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=639.92s)]
*  And it provided medication and it kept babies from being born HIV positive. That program's ended [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  because of Elon Musk and Donald Trump right now. And kids are starving around the world because [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=653.52s)]
*  they don't think we should support these programs. And that gives a wide opening for the Chinese. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXP5rEaWyA&t=659.68s)]
