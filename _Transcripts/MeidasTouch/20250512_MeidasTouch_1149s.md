# Trump has DISASTER Presser after GIVING UP
**MeidasTouch:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw)
*  Donald Trump just held a disastrous press conference in the Oval Office, where he attacked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=0.0s)]
*  members of the press for bringing up the fact that Qatar is giving Trump a $400 million [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=5.3s)]
*  private 747 jet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=11.64s)]
*  Also Donald Trump announced his latest price controls that he wants to unilaterally impose [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=14.52s)]
*  via executive order instead of actually systemically addressing our broken health care system. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  And of course Donald Trump needed a new distraction after completely caving and capitulating to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=26.82s)]
*  China in the negotiations that took place over this weekend, removing his tariffs on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=32.54s)]
*  China from 145% to 30%, and essentially getting nothing in return from China. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=37.76s)]
*  Just unleashing a trade war against the world that has shattered consumer confidence and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=46.54s)]
*  has harmed businesses across this country, essentially all for nothing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=52.1s)]
*  Let me show you what went down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=57.42s)]
*  Donald Trump here talks about how the European Union is now his big target. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=58.9s)]
*  They are in many ways, he says, nastier than China. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=64.04s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=67.56s)]
*  The European Union is in many ways nastier than China, okay? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=68.9s)]
*  And we've just started with them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=75.42s)]
*  Oh, they'll come down a lot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=78.54s)]
*  You watch. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=80.26s)]
*  We have all the cards. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=81.84s)]
*  They treated us very unfairly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=83.34s)]
*  They sell us 13 million cards. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=85.84s)]
*  We sell them none. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=88.48s)]
*  They sell us their agricultural products. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=90.92s)]
*  We sell them virtually none. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=94.84s)]
*  They don't take our products. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=96.68s)]
*  Next up, Donald Trump attacks members of the press and specifically an ABC reporter for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=99.28s)]
*  bringing up anything having to do with Trump getting a $400 million 747 jet from Qatar. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=111.14s)]
*  As a businessman, some people may look at this and say, have you ever been given a gift [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=112.14s)]
*  worth millions of dollars and then not received anything? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=116.5s)]
*  It's not a gift to me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=118.94s)]
*  It's a gift to the Department of Defense. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=119.94s)]
*  And you should know better because you've been embarrassed enough and so has your network. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=122.94s)]
*  Your network is a disaster. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=126.58s)]
*  ABC is a disaster. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=127.58s)]
*  Here is the bill. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Bobby, come on over here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump then claims that he does not intend to use the plane, but that he will just simply [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  put it in his library, he says. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=138.62s)]
*  He goes, it will go directly to the library. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=140.86s)]
*  I never intend to actually use the jet that you're getting as a gift. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=143.38000000000002s)]
*  I don't think I believe that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  Let's play that clip right here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=148.9s)]
*  And I think this was just a gesture of good faith. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=150.66000000000003s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=153.94000000000003s)]
*  Someday it'll be like Ronald Reagan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=155.78s)]
*  They decommission them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=157.74s)]
*  You know, they get to a certain age, they decommission them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=158.74s)]
*  It'll go to my library. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  They're talking about going to my library in years out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=162.86s)]
*  But I thought it was a great gesture. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=166.94000000000003s)]
*  And it's something that was done by Ronald Reagan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=170.06s)]
*  They actually decommissioned the plane and he put it in his library. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  And it actually has made the library, I think of Boeing 707, it's actually made the library [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=174.5s)]
*  more successful. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  So it was good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Do you plan to use the plane after you leave office? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  It would it would go directly to the library after after I leave office. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't I wouldn't be using it now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=191.73999999999998s)]
*  And then says that it would be utterly stupid for him to reject a 400 million dollar gift [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=194.46s)]
*  from a Middle East country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=201.22s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  And it's going to be a while before we get them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=204.66s)]
*  And I think Qatar, who has really we've helped them a lot over the years in terms of security [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=207.78s)]
*  and safety. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  I felt that I think they and very, very nicely. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  And I have a lot of respect for the leadership and for the leader, Qatar. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think they very they knew about it because they buy Boeing's, they buy a lot of Boeing's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=223.14s)]
*  and they knew about it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=228.26s)]
*  And they said we would like to do something. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=229.46s)]
*  And if we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=232.34s)]
*  couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=241.38s)]
*  Now, I could be a stupid person to say, oh, no, we don't want a free plane. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=246.74s)]
*  We give free things. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=250.82s)]
*  We'll take one, too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  And it helps us out because, again, we're talking about we have 40 year old aircraft. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  The money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to keep them tippy top is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  astronomical. You wouldn't even believe it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=263.62s)]
*  So I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=265.94s)]
*  I appreciate it very much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=268.82s)]
*  I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=271.46s)]
*  I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, no, we don't want a free, very expensive [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=275.42s)]
*  airplane. But it was I thought it was a great gesture. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=280.5s)]
*  No, I think it's utterly stupid and in fact, a crime, in my opinion, to be accepting a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=283.98s)]
*  400 million dollar 747 jet that actually goes to your own library, which essentially [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=289.82s)]
*  means you're getting it as a gift for yourself, not to mention these serious security [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=296.9s)]
*  concerns that come along with it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=302.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is next asked about his executive order, which Trump claims will bring [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=305.42s)]
*  down the cost of health care and prescription drugs by 50 to 80 percent. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=310.82s)]
*  Donald Trump just makes up these numbers recklessly. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=316.58s)]
*  The Ponzi schemer, the rug pulling president just makes up things to get people's hopes [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=319.38s)]
*  up. And people go, well, aren't you just setting price controls also? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=324.74s)]
*  And why aren't you addressing the broader issue of health care? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=328.22s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=331.26s)]
*  They have to we have to equalize. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=332.42s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your price controls? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=334.86s)]
*  Say it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=337.62s)]
*  How do you respond to this? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=338.62s)]
*  It's not price control. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=340.5s)]
*  No, no. What was price control is before. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=341.42s)]
*  If you want to talk about price control is what they were doing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=345.46s)]
*  They were making us pay. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=348.74s)]
*  They set a price and they said, here's what we're going to pay. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=349.98s)]
*  And anything else charge America because at that time, they had a very stupid president. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=354.58s)]
*  And it really went crazy during the last four years. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=361.14s)]
*  Now, folks, I've made another video about this earlier this morning. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=364.26s)]
*  And look, I would like to see prescription drug prices go down 50 to 80 percent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=368.26s)]
*  You're not going to achieve it the way Trump is by doing it via an executive order [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  for price controls. The way you would do it is you would actually pass legislation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=378.86s)]
*  to lower prescription drug prices. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  But you see, what actually happens is is that when Democrats want to pass that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  legislation, the mega Republicans block it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=389.7s)]
*  The Trump supporters block it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=392.94s)]
*  So I think that every American should have health care and very cheap and affordable [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=394.94s)]
*  health care. That's my view of it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  So why don't we actually address the issue versus doing these gimmicks that are just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=401.34s)]
*  intended to get people's hopes up? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=406.14s)]
*  Because what it seems the Trump regime is actually doing here is using this as a way [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  to attack European countries and actually make the price of prescription drug prices [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  go higher. A reporter asked Donald Trump about what do you say to people who think [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=417.66s)]
*  it's not great that you're getting a luxury jet as a gift? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=422.06s)]
*  And Donald Trump then makes some golf analogy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=425.98s)]
*  Play this clip. It's going to be very interesting. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=428.62s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=431.1s)]
*  to you? Why not leave it behind? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=435.38s)]

*  You know, there was an old golfer named Sam Snead. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=457.5s)]
*  Did you ever hear? He won 82 tournaments. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=460.5s)]
*  He was a great golfer. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=462.58s)]

*  I don't know how we can go unless that situation is taken care of. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=505.06s)]
*  But it's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want to write about. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=508.66s)]
*  But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=512.5s)]

*  But white farmers are being brutally killed and their land is being confiscated [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=523.94s)]
*  in South Africa. And the newspapers and the media [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=529.46s)]
*  television media doesn't even talk about it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=533.1s)]

*  of a law and is not a law, is going to allow the Republicans to do health care [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=540.02s)]
*  better than Obamacare. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=545.34s)]
*  I don't know. Why don't you actually do what's called legislation, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=547.9s)]
*  which is the way our system works? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=551.82s)]
*  And if you want to expand Obamacare, which I think that we should [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=553.62s)]
*  we should make prescription drugs more affordable, then do it through the process. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=559.38s)]
*  You're supposed to do it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=563.1s)]
*  But no, actually, you and the MAGA Republicans block that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=564.34s)]
*  because you want to take away people's health care. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=567.62s)]
*  But then you do this gimmick, which is really just a stunt [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=570.06s)]
*  that that puts people's hopes up and ends up screwing them here. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=573.66s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=576.5s)]
*  So we're going to maybe come up with something. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=577.9s)]
*  I think this gives the Republicans a chance to actually do a health care [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=579.66s)]
*  that's much better than Obamacare and for less money, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=582.66s)]
*  which I think you guys would work on that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=585.94s)]
*  My dogs, Taquito and Chiquito, are the happiest dogs ever. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=588.74s)]
*  You know why? Because I give them Sundays for dogs, which is, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=592.02s)]
*  let's face it, the best dog food ever. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=596.26s)]
*  What I love about Sundays for dogs is that, like, unlike other fresh dog food, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=598.98s)]
*  Sundays does not require refrigeration or preparation [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=604.22s)]
*  because of their air drying process. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=607.82s)]
*  You just pour it and serve it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=609.98s)]

*  It's fresh dog food. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=619.86s)]
*  It's made from a short list of human grade ingredients, which I love. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=620.9000000000001s)]
*  And I know my doggies love. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=625.5s)]
*  It was co-founded by Dr. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=626.98s)]
*  Tori Waxman, a practicing veterinarian who tests and formulates [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=628.58s)]
*  every version of each recipe. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=633.4200000000001s)]
*  And Sundays contains 100 percent all natural meat and superfoods [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=636.22s)]

*  Donald Trump then claims that he knows [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  Obamacare and health care better than anybody to play this clip. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=675.9000000000001s)]
*  I've had a president that had the courage to do this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=679.1400000000001s)]
*  and nobody knew the system like I do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=682.7s)]
*  I mean, I've gotten to know this system so well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=685.1400000000001s)]
*  And I don't think it's fair that it benefits Obamacare. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=689.22s)]
*  Obamacare is a failure. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=691.94s)]
*  It's not a good it's not a good health care. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=693.1s)]
*  It works. I made it work. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=695.86s)]
*  I had an obligation to make it work or an obligation to let it die. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=697.7s)]
*  I chose that we had to make it work. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=702.7s)]
*  I had to make it as good as possible. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=704.34s)]
*  And I had a choice. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  I could have let it fail or make it as good as possible. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=709.3000000000001s)]
*  As good as possible means it was still not very good, but it was it survived. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=712.98s)]
*  Then Donald Trump says that he's going to he just starts making up numbers. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=717.5s)]
*  We'll lower prescription drugs 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  We'll just lower it all. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=725.94s)]
*  You're playing this clip. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=726.82s)]
*  I have to do that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=727.7s)]
*  So for the first time in many years, we'll slash the cost of prescription drugs [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=729.5s)]
*  and we will bring fairness to America. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=733.22s)]
*  Drug prices will come down [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=735.46s)]
*  by much more, really, if you think 59. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=738.38s)]
*  If you if you think of a drug that is sometimes 10 times more expensive, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=741.22s)]
*  it's much more than the 59 percent. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=746.66s)]
*  You know, it depends on the way you want to analyze it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=749.26s)]
*  But in one way, you could analyze it that way. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=751.22s)]
*  But between 59 and 80 and I guess even 90 percent. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=753.66s)]
*  So when I worked so hard in the first term and if I got prices down, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=758.22s)]
*  I remember I was the only one to ever get prices down for a full year. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=763.34s)]
*  But I get them down like two percent. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=767.26s)]
*  And I thought it was like a big deal. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=768.82s)]
*  Well, we're getting them down [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=770.26s)]
*  60, 70, 80, 90 percent. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=772.6600000000001s)]
*  But actually more than that, if you think about it in the way mathematically. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=776.02s)]
*  And Farmer has then he just goes on this word salad about somehow [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=780.82s)]
*  if you add up all of the money that's coming in from tariffs, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  which, by the way, you just remove the tariffs that you say are so great. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=790.54s)]
*  If they're so great, why are you removing it? Makes no sense. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=794.54s)]
*  That's going to pay for golden domes, he says. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=798.02s)]
*  Then he just randomly starts talking about Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=801.1s)]
*  You know, he doesn't know the difference between either play this clip. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=803.9s)]
*  They just called the leader, our leader in the Senate, John Thune, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=806.3399999999999s)]
*  the Mike Johnson spoke to both of them. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=811.86s)]
*  I said, when you score, you're going to have to score two things. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=815.14s)]
*  You're going to have to number one, score that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=817.78s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money is coming in. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=820.1s)]
*  But even bigger than that, you're going to have to score that your [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=824.38s)]
*  your costs for Medicaid and Medicare and just basically [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=827.22s)]
*  pharmaceuticals and drugs is going down at a level that nobody has ever [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=831.4200000000001s)]
*  seen before. It'll pay for the golden dome. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=837.66s)]
*  I see the golden dome is there, see that'll easily pay for the golden dome. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=840.0600000000001s)]
*  And we'll have a lot of money left over. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=845.14s)]
*  We need the golden dome, by the way, in this world. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=847.58s)]
*  Although this world is a lot safer today than it was a week ago [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=851.26s)]

*  President, he calls me, he used to call me Donald. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=898.62s)]
*  Now he calls me President. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=900.82s)]
*  So that's nice respect. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=901.94s)]
*  But he's a rough guy, smart guy. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=903.1400000000001s)]
*  Very successful, very rich. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=905.9000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't even know how we would know this, but because he's got comments. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=908.1s)]
*  The president, could I ask you a question? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=910.98s)]
*  What? I'm in London and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=912.62s)]
*  I said, it's not working. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=918.22s)]
*  He said, he said, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=920.1s)]
*  I just paid $88 and in New York, I pay $1300. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=923.62s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=929.1s)]
*  Donald Trump then says that as it relates to India and Pakistan, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=931.7s)]
*  the way he negotiated a ceasefire, which he didn't do, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=935.46s)]
*  is he says, I'll do trade, you do trade, but I'll just do trade. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=939.78s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=942.5s)]
*  And the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=943.1800000000001s)]
*  and to understand the gravity of the situation. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=946.1s)]
*  And we helped a lot. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=949.3000000000001s)]
*  And we helped also with trade. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=953.22s)]
*  I said, come on, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=955.02s)]
*  Let's stop it. Let's stop it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=958.5s)]
*  If you stop it, we're doing trade. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=961.42s)]
*  If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=962.86s)]
*  People have never really used trade the way I used it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  That I can tell you. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=968.54s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they said, I think we're going to stop. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=969.86s)]
*  And they have. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=973.22s)]
*  And they did it for a lot of reasons. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=974.1s)]
*  But trade is a big one. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=977.26s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=978.9s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with India. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=981.66s)]
*  We're negotiating with India right now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=983.22s)]
*  We're going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=984.9s)]
*  And we stopped the nuclear conflict. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=987.9s)]
*  I think it would have it could have been a bad nuclear war. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=989.7s)]
*  Millions of people could have been killed. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=993.46s)]
*  So I'm very proud of that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=995.14s)]
*  And by the way, India today issued a statement directed at Pakistan [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=996.22s)]
*  saying that we don't appreciate nuclear blackmail. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1000.98s)]
*  We'll respond to you on our own terms. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1004.9s)]
*  Trump's had nothing to do with any of this, but let him take credit for things. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1006.98s)]
*  But I mean, that's what he does. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1010.98s)]
*  The corporate media lets him take credit for things. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1012.42s)]
*  Donald Trump then lies and claims that he has 11 committed [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1014.54s)]
*  massive car factories that are being built, which is easily verifiably false. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1017.9s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1022.86s)]
*  We have at least 11 committed [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1023.74s)]
*  massive car factories that are going to be built [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1028.02s)]
*  that are going to be that are in the process of being built. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1032.18s)]
*  And some are going through some have actually started. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1035.1399999999999s)]
*  We also have renovations of existing factories [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1038.46s)]
*  where they weren't utilizing the full factory from years gone by. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1041.7s)]
*  And now they're under full renovation. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1045.66s)]
*  They'll be opening up full factories in a very short period of time. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1047.38s)]
*  Our car industry is I think we're going to have the number one industry. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1050.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, if you look at Japan and these others, they they do tremendously with cars. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1053.3400000000001s)]
*  And and they can do that, too. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1057.94s)]
*  But, you know, when they if they want to sell cars in the United States, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1060.5s)]
*  they're going to have to build factories in the United States [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1063.46s)]
*  because I'm interested in cars for the United States. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  So one other thing I'm going to do a whole other video about Donald Trump. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1068.38s)]
*  Caving and blinking to China. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1071.54s)]
*  But if you just think about it, China got all the demands it wanted. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1074.34s)]
*  America removed the tariffs on China that America placed on it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1078.18s)]
*  because our bond markets and overall markets were suffering and jobs were being lost. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1083.06s)]
*  So Trump, LinkedIn capitulated. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1089.18s)]
*  And just ask yourself for all of what we've been through [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1090.8999999999999s)]
*  since Trump announced his Liberation Day or whatever you want to even call it, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1093.74s)]
*  which is actually Liquidation Day or Recession Day. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1097.46s)]
*  What did we gain from this at all other than ships not coming to the port? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1100.74s)]
*  And wasn't Donald Trump saying that that's a great thing? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1106.46s)]
*  And so if all these tariffs were great, why are you reducing them? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1109.46s)]
*  There was no sense to this at all other than to cause chaos. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1112.54s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1116.42s)]
*  Donald Trump takes his 400 million dollar Qatari jet [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1117.02s)]
*  that he claims he's not going to use. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkImexuYDGw&t=1120.46s)]
