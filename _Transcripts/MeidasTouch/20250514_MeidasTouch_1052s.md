# Fox News LOSES IT on AIR over Trump SHOCK ADMISSIONS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8)
*  State regime media known as Fox is at it again. They're getting more and more desperate each and every day now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=0.0s)]
*  They've been spending all of their time trying to justify [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=7.18s)]
*  Why they think it makes sense that their dear leader Donald Trump is getting a four hundred million dollar gold plated jet [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=10.42s)]
*  From the Qatari so cue in one of their chief propagandists Sean Hannity who tries to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=17.8s)]
*  Normalize this all and he attacks anybody who dare criticize dear leader [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=23.98s)]
*  Accepting bribes from the Middle East in plain view play the clip despite a flu a slew of recent accomplishments [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=29.34s)]
*  groundbreaking diplomacy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  The legacy state-run media mob still managed to find their new obsession an offer from the government of Qatar for a Boeing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  747 jumbo jet to serve as Air Force one. Do you get more utterly pathetic than that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=47.18s)]
*  I don't know but each and every day the depths of depravity that Fox goes through to justify [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=52.94s)]
*  Donald Trump's criminality seems to know no bounds going from Sean Hannity to one of the other [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=59.54s)]
*  propagandists on Fox Jesse waters here Jesse waters devotes a segment to talking about the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=66.86s)]

*  RFK jr. Was swimming in and photographed in something that would be a clear and present danger [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=79.02s)]
*  To your health that can cause life-threatening injuries swimming with bacteria or swimming in bacteria [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=85.14s)]
*  Infested waters it could be potentially lethal and this is what our health and human services secretary is doing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=91.5s)]
*  Here's how Jesse waters characterizes it play this clip. Jesse [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  Would you fill would you swim in a sewage filled creek that creek looks clean? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't look like it's filled with sewage and I've seen [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=107.22s)]
*  swim miles and miles [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=110.82s)]

*  I think it's fine for these clowns fascist clowns. No offense to real clowns. This is all one big joke to them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=119.82s)]
*  They just try to make this all one big humorous segment when people's lives are on the line [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  Here's another portion of that segment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=134.18s)]
*  Let's play it Terry RFK jr. Is testing his immunity this weekend by jumping into a sewage filled creek in Washington, DC [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  Deemed unsafe due to its high levels of bacteria, but RFK who's allegedly already survived a brain worm [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=143.62s)]
*  Clearly isn't worried Katie. I think he also took his grandkids in with him. Hey, it's good for your immune system [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  I myself have swam in the Potomac. I have to get Potomia [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=157.86s)]
*  It's probably just as bad as this Creek and I have a friend named Corey and he ate a raw clam ones from the bowels [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=162.14s)]
*  The Potomac he survived so I think it's okay. All right, you'll have a little enjoy get outside [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=169.85999999999999s)]

*  Transportation secretary Sean Duffy's kind of biggest claim to fame on his resume [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=188.38s)]
*  Is that he was once on the reality TV show called the real world and then he was on the reality show called the real world [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=193.73999999999998s)]

*  It's a gift. Yeah, it'll go to the Waters Foundation after I'm finished with it and that's how they try to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=254.06s)]
*  Utterly destroy just serious discourse by making a total mockery of very serious things [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=260.38s)]
*  We know what a disaster air traffic safety is right now and Sean Duffy's been going on TV each and every day [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=266.66s)]

*  It's all their fault even though none of these issues were happening under Biden Buttigieg [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=278.62s)]

*  Not fixing things is because of Biden Buttigieg or maybe it's just y'all are so incompetent and the fact that your main [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  Qualifications are real-world road rules challenge. Maybe that's one of the issues [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  So then Jesse Waters brings on Christine gnome dog killer Homeland Security Secretary [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=305.97999999999996s)]

*  Opposing with her hundred thousand dollar Rolex with her thumbs up [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=318.9s)]

*  But here she now is saying that the Democratic members of Congress [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=329.94s)]
*  Attacked the private security guards in New Jersey [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=334.46s)]
*  And that in Newark and it's actually the Democratic members who were assaulted there to blame [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=338.5s)]
*  She says they were the ones who assaulted the private security. This is the dystopian move that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=345.06s)]
*  All of these Trumpers do whatever actually took place in this case the private security [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=350.66s)]
*  Assaulting Democratic Congress members. They just said nope Democratic Congress members and the Newark mayor [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=357.14s)]
*  They assaulted the private security guards and now the Department of Justice is gonna go over gonna go after them here play this clip [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=361.98s)]
*  I tell you what Jesse what happened last Friday was we had members of Congress assaulting law enforcement officers [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=369.02s)]
*  they were [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=374.5s)]
*  Cooperating with criminals to create criminal acts and then they're saying that they were providing oversight [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=376.14s)]
*  This wasn't oversight. This was committing felonies. This was going out and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=382.32s)]
*  Attacking people who stand up for the rule of law. Here's Kristi Noem again [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=387.1s)]
*  Let's play it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=390.86s)]
*  Ace officers get up every single day and they love their jobs because they finally get to do their jobs with President Trump in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=391.5s)]
*  the White House and the fact that a member of Congress [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=397.86s)]
*  Punched them hit them body slammed them and then claimed that they were the victims [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=401.1s)]
*  It's astounding to me that someone would even vote for someone and put them in a place of leadership [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=407.24s)]
*  When they perpetuate something as hypocritical and as criminal as what these individuals did [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  So I I hope that the rest of the members of the House of Representatives will hold them accountable [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=417.86s)]
*  They shouldn't be allowed to to be on the committees that they're on [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=422.62s)]
*  One of them is supposed to be conducting oversight over ice and instead she's assaulting them [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=425.94s)]
*  And they don't deserve to be in the house. They should be censured by it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=431.46s)]
*  I just I it's it's what's happening in this country and what agendas the Democrats are embracing is absurd and it's not American [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=434.34s)]
*  And I'm hoping that the American people [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=442.36s)]
*  Recognize it and hold them accountable for what they're doing for criminal acts against people in this country [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=445.38s)]
*  And now they've been bringing out this other [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=449.98s)]
*  Propagandist Trisha McLaughlin who's the Department of Homeland Security Public Affairs [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=453.06s)]
*  Assistant secretary they have her in Fox all of the time and now she's pushing this line that it was the Democratic members of Congress [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  At this Delaney Hall at this detention center this migrant detention center that they were the ones who ended up attacking [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  The security guards and maybe the Department of Justice is gonna have to prosecute the Democrats and outplay this clip [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=475.18s)]
*  He's not fighting for American victims [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=481.5s)]
*  And I'd like to lay out the facts the fact that it was these three members of Congress who trespassed [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  Broke the law and stormed that ice detention facility. They put law enforcement at risk [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=487.98s)]
*  They put our detainees at risk and they put our staff at risk had they asked for a tour [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  We would have happily facilitated one for them [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=497.94s)]
*  But there was absolutely no notice and the fact that they put hands they body slammed body rammed push shove [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=500.06s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it was assault on our ice agents and it's unacceptable [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=506.58000000000004s)]

*  Donald Trump just blatantly admits to the violation of the Constitution. He goes why would I turn down the gift? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=589.94s)]
*  They offered me a gift. Of course, I'm going to accept it by the way, it then goes to his [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=595.66s)]
*  Presidential library. Why do you need? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=600.76s)]
*  747 gold-plated jets for your presidential library. This is a security threat. This in my opinion is a bribe [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=603.98s)]
*  It's a clear violation of the emoluments clause. Here's Donald Trump saying in his own words played this clip [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=611.14s)]
*  They had a plane not a new plane at all [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=616.0999999999999s)]
*  But they had a plane and you know these planes a plane that you're on right now is almost 40 years old [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=618.5s)]
*  and when you land and you see Saudi Arabia and you see [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=624.02s)]
*  UAE and you see Qatar and you see all these and they have these brand new bowling 747s mostly and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=628.0999999999999s)]
*  You see ours next to it. This is like a totally different plane. It's much smaller [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=635.14s)]
*  It's much less impressive as impressive as it is and you know with the United States of America [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=640.54s)]
*  I believe that we should have the most impressive life. So anyway, so they said to me [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=645.74s)]
*  We would like to in effect. We would like to make a gift. You've done so many things and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=651.0999999999999s)]
*  We'd like to make a gift to the defense Defense Department, which is where it's going [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=657.54s)]
*  And they said well, that's nice now some people say oh you shouldn't accept gifts for the country [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=662.5s)]
*  My attitude is why wouldn't I accept the gift we're giving to everybody else? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=668.6600000000001s)]
*  why wouldn't I accept the gift because it's gonna be a couple of years I think before the bowings are finished and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=673.14s)]
*  And they'll be wonderful when they're finished, but that's a long time next Donald Trump then lies and says that he has personally studied [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=679.6600000000001s)]
*  The healthcare industry he's figured it all out and he goes the Democrats are the ones who have raised the price the Republicans [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  We've always been trying to lower costs literally as we speak the Republicans are trying to get rid of Medicaid [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=694.14s)]
*  They're trying to eliminate [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=701.26s)]
*  880 billion dollars that goes to Medicaid the mega Republicans are the ones who have consistently [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=703.4200000000001s)]
*  Voted against lowering prescription drug prices any effort to lower health care costs the mega Republicans have been against but [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=710.74s)]
*  This is again. This is their strategy the same way earlier [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=718.62s)]
*  You see the mega Republicans attacking Democrats and saying Democrats are the ones who went after the private security guards when it was the opposite [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=722.4599999999999s)]
*  You're seeing them do that again right here and saying the Democrats were the ones who want to increase your health care costs [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  Literally as the Republicans are getting rid of your Medicaid right now play this clip and now after studying the industry [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=736.4599999999999s)]
*  It's a very complex industry, but I figured it out and I said it's not gonna happen [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=742.62s)]
*  But the Democrats fought very hard to keep the prices of drugs very very high [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=747.26s)]
*  they really ought to blame for this because they should have done something about it and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=752.62s)]
*  When the Republicans went with requests they said we're not gonna approve it and then Donald Trump goes on and then starts [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=756.9399999999999s)]
*  Talking about what he calls fat shots and he says he's got a fat friend and that his fat friend gets fat shots and that's some [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=764.14s)]
*  Reason that has to do with an executive order [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=771.9s)]
*  That doesn't have the force of law that's just a scam that he says he's going to be able to lower health care costs by up [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=775.62s)]
*  To 50 to 90 percent just goes 50 to 90 percent. I've lowered health care costs [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=782.9s)]
*  I did it by an executive order because of my fat friend and his fat shots [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=787.98s)]
*  Donald Trump says play this clip a friend of mine who's slightly overweight to put it mildly [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=791.8199999999999s)]
*  Went to a drugstore in London and he was able to get one of the fat shots. I caught the fat shots [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=797.5s)]
*  You lose weight a lot of people laugh at that. Some people get offended by I don't get offended by I'm just glad I didn't use [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=804.9399999999999s)]

*  He knows exactly who I was talking about. He called he said that was interesting [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=816.6999999999999s)]
*  He said he was very concerned that I might use his name. I might slip now [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=821.1s)]
*  He doesn't have to work, but he went to London and he bought this [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=824.3399999999999s)]
*  I guess [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=829.02s)]
*  Ozempic will go over you one of those I guess yeah, I'm not sure which one they bought he bought one of them. Maybe is epic [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=831.02s)]
*  And he bought it and he's told me he said hey [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=837.66s)]
*  Strange thing happened. I just bought a drug [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=842.14s)]
*  Same company same plan same everything everything was the same in one case. I paid in New York [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  $1,300 and in London, I'm paying $88 [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=852.66s)]
*  He said what's going on now he knew that he's a very smart guy is a very rich guy [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=855.7399999999999s)]

*  Okay, to be honest with you, but makes him feel good. Anyway, I pointed this out before and let me point it out again [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=864.3s)]
*  This is just one of Donald Trump's scams [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=869.9799999999999s)]
*  This way he says I'm lowering health care costs, which he's not while the MAGA Republicans in their tax budget [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=872.54s)]
*  Which Trump calls a big beautiful bill is literally taking away [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  Ripping away from you health care [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=883.18s)]
*  I think the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office believes there's gonna be what tens of millions of Americans who will lose health care as [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=885.5s)]
*  A result of this policy lose health care [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=893.62s)]
*  But Donald Trump signs a fake executive order and says 90% health care costs and then he feeds that to his base [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=896.18s)]
*  And this has real-world impacts. I mean, let me show you what's going out there in America [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=903.5s)]
*  And this was an event that Charlie Kirk had just hosted and in this event [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC17PztJ-8&t=908.7800000000001s)]
