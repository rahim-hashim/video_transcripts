# Wall Street TURNS AGAINST Trump WAY TOO LATE!!
**MeidasTouch:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc)
*  Yes, Wall Street and the financiers are turning against Donald Trump with another week of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=0.0s)]
*  economic chaos, market volatility, the dollar crashing, the bond market imploding, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=6.96s)]
*  treasury yields going to some of the highest levels in a very long period of time, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=14.64s)]
*  consumer confidence at the lowest levels in about 45 years. But in turning against [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, we're now trying to throw him under the bus, these Wall Street execs, these hedge funders, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=27.52s)]
*  they're also kind of telling on themselves, aren't they? Because weren't these the same people who [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=34.16s)]
*  teamed up with corporate media when former President Biden was in charge? And we got headlines like [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=39.84s)]
*  this. Forecast for US recession within the year hits 100% in blow to Biden. A 100% projection [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=46.16s)]
*  of a recession that never happened under former President Biden. How about headlines like this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Why a US recession is still likely and coming soon? This was from Bloomberg. The government is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  staying open for now, but Bloomberg economics sees risks ahead from strikes to higher rates and oil [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=68.88s)]
*  prices. There was no recession under former President Biden. How about this headline from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=73.84s)]
*  the New York Times back in January 2024? The US seems to be dodging a recession, but what could [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=78.56s)]
*  still go wrong? Economists have become increasingly optimistic about the odds of a soft landing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=85.28s)]
*  But as 2024 begins to unfold, the risks remain. Now, what do you think those same corporate media [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=91.2s)]
*  headlines and economists and hedge funders, what were their projections of recession [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=98.8s)]
*  under Donald Trump? Let me take a look at it right here. This from Business Insider, and I could show [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  you half a dozen more, but you get the point. The probability of a US recession in 2025 is 0% [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=109.28s)]
*  according to a top economist. But here's what to worry about instead. Nothing about a recession. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=118.32s)]
*  Where are we now? Well, you have JP Morgan believing that there's about a 60% [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=125.04s)]
*  recession call despite Trump's 90-day tariff pause, which is not really a tariff pause. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  He's basically just moved the effective rate of tariffs from 27% to 25%. Now you have people like [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=137.44s)]
*  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink saying, we're probably already in a recession right now. You've got [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=144.08s)]
*  people like Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, who previously said, suck it up when it comes to a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=151.12s)]
*  little bit of inflation, saying Donald Trump's inflationary measures are likely to cause a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=158.16s)]
*  recession. You know, we come with receipts here at the Midas Touch Network, so let's bring those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=164.16s)]
*  receipts one by one and let me make the case for you. First, I'm going to show you, of course, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=169.12s)]
*  that all of these hedge funders and private equity people and wall streeters are turning [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=174.4s)]
*  against Trump, but I also want to call them out because they're doing it for self-preservation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  right now. This from the independent. Fund managers quietly fear Trump doesn't have a tariff plan [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  and that he might be insane. Some fund managers concern that the White House is not acting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=193.12s)]
*  rationally, but rather on ideology. And some even fear this may not even be ideology, that it's just [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=198.64s)]
*  his utter insanity causing this all. How about this headline from the Wall Street Journal? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=205.6s)]
*  Wall Street sounds an alarm. The economy is at risk thanks to tariffs. Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=211.44s)]
*  and the big bank executives say cracks are already showing following volatility in markets and policy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  By the way, the way I think about it right now to give you a visual, you know how the shore [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=224.72s)]
*  recedes when there's a tsunami about to hit and you know the danger is coming? Well, what's happened [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=231.04s)]
*  in the American economy already is we've got a tsunami that hit us already sooner than people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=239.12s)]
*  expected and you have the waters receding for the bigger tsunami that's about to happen when there's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=245.76s)]
*  going to be a ripple effect when these tariffs start to impact businesses where what you'll end [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=252.96s)]
*  up seeing is bankruptcies which trigger more bankruptcies and more defaults which then cause [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=260.8s)]
*  bankruptcies and more defaults within the lenders. And what we're seeing right now with the dollar [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=267.52s)]
*  crash and with the treasury yields surging is that foreign markets or foreign governments and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=272.88s)]
*  people in other countries no longer trust the United States as a stable economy at all. They [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=279.36s)]
*  view the United States like an Argentina. Doesn't Donald Trump love the leader of Argentina? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=287.04s)]
*  Yeah, Javier Mal√© or kind of like El Salvador where the economy is about a $26 billion GDP. So [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=294.88s)]
*  we've attacked our friends, Canada with trillion-dollar GDPs, Europe one of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  biggest markets in the world, Australia and others and we've made friends with Hungary and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  El Salvador and North Korea and I'm not sure they're even the friends there. They probably look at us [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=315.76s)]
*  you know as kind of weak and pathetic based on Donald Trump as well. Let me bring some receipts [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  right now. This is Larry Fink. Here he is on CNBC where he says that he thinks we are either [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=326.24s)]
*  very close to a recession or in a recession right now. Play this clip. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=335.12s)]
*  United States post-World War II was a global stabilizer. We are the global destabilizer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=339.92s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=348.24s)]
*  Now that's a very, you know that's a very hard thing to say because I pride ourselves [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=349.76s)]
*  of being you know bringing the leadership, bringing the conversations. Yes, I do believe [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=355.6s)]
*  we're probably starting if not we're in a recession. Yes, I think the market is still [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  anticipating, underestimating how high inflation can get. If you factor in all the tariffs, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=365.92s)]
*  right, you factor in all these other issues it's going to be quite additive. I mean I read in a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  report that if you just take the tariffs in the cost of home building the average new home could [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=380.72s)]
*  be up as much as 26 percent. We already have a housing affordability problem. None of this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=386.24s)]
*  sounds any good to me. All right, I mean and it's all self-inflicted by the way. None of it needed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  to happen. This is not a pandemic. This is not a financial crisis. This is something that we've [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=396.0s)]
*  created but in the short run I'm I'm petrified in some of these issues. Petrified. Let's speak [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  being petrified. And here's Larry Think again CEO of BlackRock saying most CEOs I talked to would [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=405.6s)]
*  say we're in a recession now. Let's play this clip. Are we headed for a recession? Are we in a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=412.32s)]
*  recession? I you know most CEOs I talked to would say we are probably in a recession right now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=419.92s)]
*  Right now. Right now. All right well now let me go to Jamie Dimon. Remember when Jamie Dimon [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=427.04s)]
*  was you know attending this fancy event. You see him right here and he said you know Americans just [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=435.2s)]
*  need to suck it up when it comes to a little inflation. Here he is right here on Squawk Box [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=441.52s)]
*  on CNBC. He goes just get over inflation. Play this clip. An economic tool. That's it. They're [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=448.16s)]
*  an economic weapon. You know depending how you use it and why you use it and stuff like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=454.88s)]
*  And you know people argue is inflationary and non-inflationary. I would put in perspective if [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=458.72s)]
*  it's a little inflationary but it's good for national security so be it. I mean get over it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=463.68s)]
*  National security trumps a little bit more inflation. Well then on April 7th JP Morgan CEO [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=468.88s)]
*  Jamie Dimon said the Trump tariffs will boost inflation and slow and already weakening [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=473.44s)]
*  U.S. economy. And here earlier in the week when Jamie Dimon was asked do you personally expect [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=478.88s)]
*  a recession? You can listen to what he says. Play this clip. So are you hearing that from [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=486.0s)]
*  CEOs as well in terms of business managers? Are they now going to start pulling it in and cutting [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=491.36s)]
*  back on various expenses? I think you're going to see a little bit of that. Yes. But how significant [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=497.2s)]
*  would you expect that? Do you personally expect a recession? I am going to defer to my accounts at [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  this point but I think probably that's a likely outcome. Because markets I mean when you see a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=507.92s)]
*  2000 point decline it sort of feeds on itself doesn't it? Because it makes you feel like you're [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=515.44s)]
*  losing money in your 401k. You're losing money in your pension. You got to cut back. Yeah I always [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=520.8s)]
*  remind people markets aren't always right but sometimes they are right. I think this time they [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  are right because they're just pricing uncertainty at the macro level and uncertainty of the micro [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  level at the actual company level. And then how it affects consumer sentiment it's hard to tell. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  You know consumers still have jobs. Wages are going up the low end which I think is a good thing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=539.68s)]
*  But if companies start cutting back yeah the consumer sentiment changes and business sentiment [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  changes. I think you've already seen business sentiment change a little bit. Hopefully no one's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=548.08s)]
*  wishing for that but hopefully if there is one it'll be short. But I do think fixing these tariff [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=552.96s)]
*  issues and traders should be a good thing to do. That will get one major uncertainty behind us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=559.6s)]
*  We have the strongest economy in the world. It would be good not to add to the uncertainty out there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=564.48s)]
*  Also Jamie Dimon is now saying that he expects in the Spencer Akimian reports. Spencer Akimian does [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  a good job reporting this. He expects the Fed, Jamie Dimon who you just saw in those clips, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=574.64s)]
*  expects the Federal Reserve to have to step in and rescue the bond market because the bond market [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=579.28s)]
*  is imploding. Unprecedented times. We had a 3% real GDP a quarter ago. JP Morgan and Chase CEO, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=586.8s)]
*  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he expects a kerfuffle in the U.S. Treasury market [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=595.6s)]
*  that prompts a Federal Reserve intervention. There will be a kerfuffle. You know like these [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=600.88s)]
*  languages. A kerfuffle. I guess to billionaires a kerfuffle. You're going to be kerfuffled. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=605.84s)]
*  I mean when people are suffering your 401ks are being destroyed. Your pensions are being destroyed [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=611.84s)]
*  to these billionaires. That's a kerfuffle. And then the Fed we're going to have to intervene. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=616.4s)]
*  You know a kerfuffle here and here and there. Larry Fink was at that same event where Jamie [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=620.24s)]
*  Dimon was. Here's BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. This was January 23rd, 2025. It was the same day Jamie [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=630.0s)]
*  Dimon was there in the early days of the Trump regime. Literally the earliest days. And here [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=637.92s)]
*  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink just said he wants the SEC to rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=644.32s)]
*  and stocks. Play this clip. As a huge believer of crypto and blockchain and tokenization, I mean [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=650.32s)]
*  I want the SEC to rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks. That will simplify things, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=658.16s)]
*  make things easier. Some of the tax on BlackRock. BlackRock would never have to vote on a proxy [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=665.28s)]
*  vote anymore because every owner record would be notified through a tokenization of equities. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=670.0s)]
*  And we had and it would save more money for more people. It would bring down the cost of ownership [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cToOhGpvUc&t=675.52s)]
