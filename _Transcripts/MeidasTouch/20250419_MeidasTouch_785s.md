# Trump’s NIGHTMARE RETURNS as MASS PROTESTS are BACK
**MeidasTouch:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU)
*  The protests are not going away, Donald. They're just going to keep on growing and growing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Shout out to 5051 organizing more mass protests today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  There's expected to be over 400 protests scheduled across the United States, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=12.0s)]
*  also protests in Mexico and in Europe as well. We will be covering them all throughout the day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  In addition, there's expected to be over 525 broader events in connection with 5051 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  being run by We The People Descent, a 5051 affiliate listing all of these events. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=36.32s)]
*  So the movement continues and of course this follows the massive hands-off protests [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=43.92s)]
*  that took place earlier in April when you added up all of the towns and cities [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=51.52s)]
*  where those protests took place. There were several million people by some estimates, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=57.92s)]
*  about five million people protesting when you added up all of the protests. Big protests in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=63.6s)]
*  Chicago, big protests in Boston, big protests in Salt Lake City. And one of the things we're seeing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  too is with that momentum running parallel, we've seen the Fight The Oligarchy Tour by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=77.6s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders and AOC and we've seen Democrats going into red districts and purple [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=84.88s)]
*  districts and just speaking to people about issues that are not being covered enough that need to, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=93.28s)]
*  that people are suffering from. We have to talk about education. We have to talk about health care. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=99.84s)]
*  We have to talk about the oligarchs taking all these tax cuts for themselves while screwing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=106.48s)]
*  over others. We have to talk about wages. There's got to be not just a living wage, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=112.4s)]
*  there's got to be a wage with dignity and right now there's a minimum of minimum wages while the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=118.4s)]
*  billionaires get richer and richer. We need to talk about why it is that in the richest country [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  in the world, right, the richest country in the world, people struggle to get health care. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=131.92s)]
*  Those are the types of issues that are on people's mind and of course the fact that the Trump regime [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  is disappearing human beings without due process and sending them to concentration camps in El [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=143.44s)]
*  Salvador and then just saying, oopsies, there's nothing I can do about it. I want to share with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  you some of the sites of these protests, but I think it's important to note the very significant [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=155.04s)]
*  drop in Donald Trump's polling as well and in the Republican polling as well and to me though, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=161.2s)]
*  that speaks to people getting out there, talking to your neighbors, your friends, your colleagues, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=168.32s)]
*  and letting them know about these protests. I want to talk about where these protests are as well [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=174.0s)]
*  today and I hope you will attend if you can or if you can't attend because you're unable to. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=179.6s)]
*  Just let people know about them if there's protests nearby. Let me just show you Donald [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump's polling data recently. It's really, really bad. It kind of looks like his signature [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  going on a downward angle at this point. If you ask Americans, is the economy getting worse? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=197.68s)]
*  Most Americans by significant margins say it's worse or much worse now than under former President [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=204.16s)]
*  Biden. If you look at the Trump regime, their polling when it comes to handling of the economy, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=210.88s)]
*  it is far worse than the first Trump administration. The economy, even though I thought it should never [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=217.84s)]
*  be viewed as a strong suit for Republicans and Trump, that's really how it always was, but here [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=224.24s)]
*  as G. Eliot Morris, the great pollster writes, Trump's job approval rating on the economy is now [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=231.2s)]
*  at an all-time low, even worse than during COVID-19. Opinion on his handling of inflation is at [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=238.08s)]
*  negative 18 on average. He has now lost the GOP's single best political asset of the last decade, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=244.8s)]
*  and it should never have been because the Democrats of the 52 million jobs that have been created [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=251.84s)]
*  over the past three decades, they've been created by Democrats. 50 million of those created by [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  Democrats, and Trump was the only president other than Herbert Hoover. I called Trump pervert Hoover [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=261.76s)]
*  because he's a sexual abuser who lost jobs in his term. You take a look at some of these other [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=266.72s)]
*  issues. Trump is underwater on the economy, negative 9.3 percent. On trade, negative 15.2 percent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  On inflation and cost of living, negative 17.5 percent. If you look at the data here, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=280.8s)]
*  while it does show that he's above water on the issue of immigration by plus 4.7, when you actually [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=287.12s)]
*  dig into the issue and you talk about deporting people who have been here for 10 years with no [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=294.24s)]
*  criminal record or kidnapping people and sending them to El Salvador concentration camps, Trump is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=298.88s)]
*  very unpopular when you talk about comprehensive immigration. The type that frankly Democrats [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=304.88s)]
*  support and former President Biden supports. Americans in a vacuum are okay with deportations. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=310.72s)]
*  They're okay with borders. So am I. The issue is kidnapping people without due process, throwing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=316.88s)]
*  them to concentration camps, recklessly rounding up migrants, destroying the economy of people here [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=323.2s)]
*  working and contributing and providing no process at all and going after people without criminal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  history. I don't like that and neither do the American people when you really break down [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=336.08s)]
*  the issues. If you just take a weighted average also of these polls involving Donald Trump, even [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=341.36s)]
*  if you add all of these right wing like Rasmussen where Trump has 51 percent disapproval from Rasmussen, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=347.28s)]
*  which is like as pro Trump as you can get right now, you still have 51.6 percent of Americans [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=356.0s)]
*  disapproving them. Then when you go into some of the cross tabs in month three of the second term, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  under 100 days, Trump's average approval rating is under 40 percent among the following groups. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=369.52s)]
*  Black people, people ages 18 to 29. Black people only support 23 percent support. Ages 18 to 29, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=375.6s)]
*  Trump only has 34 percent. Independence 37 percent. Moderates 37 percent. Women 39 percent. Latinos 39 [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=382.88s)]
*  percent. And when you go to ages 30 to 44, 41 percent. White college grad 41 percent. Urban 41 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=390.88s)]
*  percent. And houses 50k household incomes 42 percent. College grads 42 percent approval. All [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=398.32s)]
*  underwater there. Here's the Rasmussen poll showing that Donald Trump 51 percent disapprove. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  And as Adam Carlson says, I think the argument that D should talk about immigration, that D, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  that Democrats shouldn't talk about immigration because Trump and Republicans currently pull [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=417.68s)]
*  better on it off its base. I get the logic. But when you go through asking people, do you agree [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=422.64s)]
*  you should deport undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=428.0s)]
*  That has negative 37 percent approval. Deport undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=432.64s)]
*  citizens by birth. Negative 36 percent. Deport undocumented immigrants who have not broken laws [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=439.28s)]
*  in the U.S. except for immigration laws. Negative 18 percent. Deport immigrants who are in the U.S. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=445.36s)]
*  living illegally back even if they've lived here for a number of years have jobs and no criminal [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=450.8s)]
*  record. Negative 14 percent. So you go through all of these issues and Trump's policies of revoking [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=455.44s)]
*  temporary protected status is not popular. All right, let's talk more about the protests. But [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=462.8s)]
*  I wanted to show you that the protests are working. People are, it's forcing people not just to take [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=468.88s)]
*  to the streets, but now it has this, it's a solve for the first mover problem where lots of people [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=475.28s)]
*  go, wait a minute, is this normal? Is this normal? No, it's not normal. Oh, got it. And then you start [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=482.16s)]
*  paying attention to what's going on. Here's how Newsweek reports it. List of cities hosting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  nationwide anti-Trump protests on Saturday, April 19th. A wave of protests is set to sweep across all [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=492.72s)]
*  50 states on Saturday, April 19th, organized by the grassroots group 5051 in opposition to Trump's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=499.6s)]
*  policies and executive orders. Organizers cite concerns over civil liberties, judicial independence, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=506.0s)]
*  and what they describe as authoritarian overreach. The group 5051 also organized protests like [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=512.64s)]
*  the Not My President's Day event in February. The global hands-off demonstration on April 15th [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=519.6s)]
*  has become a fixture of the national resistance. April 19th is expected to span the entire country [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=526.32s)]
*  and these protests continue to grow. And one of the things 5051's focused on is really trying to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=533.2s)]
*  get that 3.5% of the U.S. population to show up and get out there, and hopefully more than that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=540.08s)]
*  But they understand that it's growing it protest by protest by protest. And I've always said, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  I expect there to be a democracy summer. So you take a look at where these protests are, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=554.48s)]
*  and you should all check out the 5051 website as well to see if there's a protest near you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  You spell it out 50 f i f t y f i f t y. So it's 5050.1. 5050.1. And then you go and check it out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=567.44s)]
*  There are everywhere these protests from Montgomery, Alabama, to Maui, Hawaii, to Lexington, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=578.08s)]
*  Kentucky, to Quincy, Illinois, to Kansas City, Missouri, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to Rutherford [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=583.36s)]
*  County, North Carolina. There's the locations and all these other cities and towns. So search the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=589.92s)]
*  one nearest you if you wanted to go out there today. And let me just read. Here's a map so [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=595.52s)]
*  you can see on the map what it looks like for this is being called the people dissent event. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=600.32s)]
*  And you can see on the map right there where all of the protests are going to be virtually [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=606.16s)]
*  everywhere. You can see right there. And let me just share this with you as well. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  This was from April 5th. This is what it looked like in Chicago. Let's play this clip. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=616.88s)]
*  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. Let's talk about numbers. Traditional in-person therapy can [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVP6suq7mHU&t=632.8000000000001s)]
