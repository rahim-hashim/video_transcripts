# Trump gets TERRIBLE NEWS in AM and MAKES IT WORSE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw)
*  The vile grifter and felon Donald Trump continues to be a vile grifter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Emails like this were being sent from Trump to people on his email list this morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=6.0s)]
*  Please, please confirm receipt, please! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=11.5s)]
*  And then when you click it, it says, I need three million responses right away. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=14.5s)]
*  And then when you click the button, it asks you for money. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=18.0s)]
*  Now, this says Donald Trump had the MAGA Republicans push through that disastrous budget bill [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=21.0s)]
*  that's going to get rid of your Medicaid, probably get rid of your Medicare. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=27.0s)]
*  It's going to get rid of supplemental nutrition assistance programs, get rid of rental assistance. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=32.0s)]
*  I think 13 to 14 million Americans at least are going to lose their health care. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=37.0s)]
*  And we're probably going to start to see about $4 trillion annual deficits pretty soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=42.0s)]
*  This thing is a massive disaster. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=48.0s)]
*  Even a MAGA Republican, Thomas Massey, who did not support this bill, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=50.0s)]
*  says you're probably looking at 20 to 30 trillion dollar additions to the deficit as a result of this disaster. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=55.0s)]
*  While all of this is taking place, what is Donald Trump doing? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=63.0s)]
*  Well, tonight is the big night for Donald Trump's crypto coin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=66.0s)]
*  The Trump crypto scam, shit coin, meme coin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=71.0s)]
*  They're holding a dinner right now, access for Donald Trump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=75.0s)]
*  It's about $1 million per seat when you actually look at the people who have bought Trump's meme coin. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=80.0s)]
*  About 55,000 or so people lost money off of Donald Trump's meme coin. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=87.0s)]
*  I think there was a report that said about 25 or 30 wallets actually made money off of it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=92.0s)]
*  And the people who put the most money into it get access with Donald Trump, literally selling access. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=99.0s)]
*  As you know, yesterday the Trump regime officially accepted the $400 million Qatari airplane to be used by Donald Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=106.0s)]
*  I call it a bribe because that's what I believe it to be. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=115.0s)]
*  Now, that's how you know. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=120.0s)]
*  The United States for sale, $400 million. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=121.0s)]
*  And also you saw yesterday the South African president Ramaphosa was there and said, sorry, I can't get you an airplane, Donald. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=124.0s)]
*  He goes, well, if you did, I would take your airplane. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=131.0s)]
*  How embarrassing and humiliating for the United States to have that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=134.0s)]
*  But the Wall Street Journal reports how a crypto billionaire who feared arrest in the US is now returning to the United States for dinner with Donald Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=139.0s)]
*  Justin Sun, whose digital currency network is popular with crypto industries, criminal underbelly, is a top investor in Trump's meme coin and other Trump crypto endeavors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=150.0s)]
*  He will be partying it up with Donald Trump because he's given millions of dollars to the Trump family. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=163.0s)]
*  Exactly what our Constitution and our laws seek to avoid. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=170.0s)]
*  But we now have a cacostocracy, an authoritarian regime in the United States and a pretty stupid one as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=175.0s)]
*  This also from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=184.0s)]
*  Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster clubs are taking in more money than ever. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=187.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is now raising the entry fees at many of his resorts, which attract donors seeking to influence his policy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=192.0s)]
*  So it now costs a record one million dollars to join Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida resort, according to people familiar with the membership fees, up from about five hundred thousand dollars during his first term. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=200.0s)]
*  So in addition to the meme coins, in addition to all the other crap that he sells, the sneakers, now it costs a million dollars to have access to his club, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=214.0s)]
*  which he declares as a residence to deflate its value by calling it a club, which he says is twenty six million dollars to pay less property tax, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=225.0s)]
*  but then claims to the world it's actually worth a billion dollars, which he doesn't pay property tax on. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=235.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and Melania made this announcement through Fox News as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=242.0s)]
*  A.I. Melania, the first lady, embarks on a new frontier in publishing with the audiobook, audiobook memoir. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=246.0s)]
*  OK, what's the new frontier here? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=256.0s)]
*  I mean, we've seen Google, Vio, we've seen all of these. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=259.0s)]
*  It's not a new frontier that Melania, after living in the United States for as long as she did, I mean, I'm not trying to be offensive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=262.0s)]
*  I can't understand what Melania is saying. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=269.0s)]
*  Very rarely can I understand what she's saying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=271.0s)]
*  And now they're having an A.I. Melania. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=274.0s)]
*  I wonder how that's going to sound. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=277.0s)]
*  And that's one of their big pushes today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=278.0s)]
*  This isn't going to help the American people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=280.0s)]
*  It's just further grifting from the Trumps. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=282.0s)]
*  As our editor and chief Ron Filipkowski writes, they have created an A.I. Melania to read her audiobook memoir. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=284.0s)]
*  Quote, I'm proud to be at the forefront of publishing's new frontier. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=291.0s)]
*  An A.I. generated replica of my voice under strict supervision will establish an unforgettable connection with my personal story. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=295.0s)]
*  You know, the unforgettable connection that you all should really care about, a connection with the people who are going to be suffering as a result of this disastrous budget bill, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=304.0s)]
*  which is the largest redistribution of wealth in the history. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=314.0s)]
*  As you steal people's health care, as you take away their Medicaid and their Medicare and supplemental nutrition assistance program, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=318.0s)]
*  as you literally steal their education, you're giving it to the billionaires who party at Mar-a-Lago for a one million dollar entry fee. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=325.0s)]
*  It is utterly pathetic and utterly ridiculous. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=334.0s)]
*  And it's going to further erode the United States of America's international standing or what is left of it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=338.0s)]
*  What is left of it? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=346.0s)]
*  Well, now the 10 year Treasury yields hit a high of 4.623 percent, which is the highest level in a very long period of time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=348.0s)]
*  The 30 year Treasury yields are way past a five handle at this point. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=357.0s)]
*  Oh, and if you want to take a look right now at the credit default swaps of the United States, they are priced just as expensively as Greece, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=365.0s)]
*  which went bankrupt recently. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=375.0s)]
*  So the United States and Greece, the United States and Argentina, the United States and Hungary, the United States and El Salvador. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=377.0s)]
*  That's kind of the group of kind of losers right there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=386.0s)]
*  While Donald Trump thinks that that makes him strong and he attacks our allies like Canada and Europe and others who have actually significant annual GDPs, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=390.0s)]
*  while Qatar's GDP is 200 billion dollars a year and Donald Trump takes a 400 million dollar jet from them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=401.0s)]
*  So yesterday also was the third worst stock market reaction to a bond auction in history. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=409.0s)]
*  It was a horrible bond auction because the international markets, international buyers of our bonds don't want to buy it anymore. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=417.0s)]
*  That's why the 10, 20, 30 year Treasury yields are going very, very high in order to actually find a buyer of these bonds. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=427.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=436.0s)]
*  But also as this impacts the consumer, the overall rise in prices charged for goods and services in May was the steepest since August 2022, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=437.0s)]
*  which is indicative of consumer price inflation moving sharply higher. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=449.0s)]
*  Now, you know this. We don't have to listen to pundits. You don't have to listen to me. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=454.0s)]
*  You go into the grocery store, you go into whatever stores you go into to buy things. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=458.0s)]
*  Right. And what do you see? The prices are higher. They're not going down. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=465.0s)]
*  So when Donald Trump and his idiots say, oh, it's going down, we fixed everything. Things are great. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=470.0s)]
*  They are not great. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=475.0s)]
*  So you ever try to split a bill with friends and someone goes, I'll get you back next time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah, next time never comes. Let's face it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=480.0s)]
*  And that's why I love Cash App. It's fast, super easy to use and honestly just way better than the other apps. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=483.0s)]
*  I signed up in like a minute and was sending money instantly. No weird fees, no nonsense. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=488.0s)]
*  And here's the thing. Cash App actually looks out for you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=493.0s)]
*  If you're about to send money to someone sketchy, it'll flag it and give you a heads up. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=496.0s)]
*  It's like having a bodyguard for your cash. And come on, it even lets you add custom text, stamps and backgrounds. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=500.0s)]
*  If I'm paying you back for brunch, I'm doing it with style. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=505.0s)]
*  So for some reason you're still living in the dark ages and don't have Cash App. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=508.0s)]
*  Here's how to get started. Download it from your phone's app store, sign up, enter our code MITUS into your profile, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=512.0s)]
*  send five dollars to a friend and you will get ten dollars just for getting started. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=518.0s)]
*  For a limited time only, new Cash App users can use our exclusive code to earn some additional cash. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=523.0s)]
*  For real, there is no catch. Just download Cash App and sign up. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=528.0s)]
*  Use our exclusive referral code MITUS, M-E-I-D-A-S, in your profile, send five dollars to a friend within 14 days [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=532.0s)]
*  and you'll get ten dollars dropped right into your account. Terms apply. That's money. That's Cash App. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=540.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's what they're saying. I mean, you have Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=546.0s)]
*  giving these tone deaf speeches or interviews at these conferences and say, we're doing just a stupid thing with his hand too. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=553.0s)]
*  We're doing so good right now. Like who? The stupid hand things these people do. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=562.0s)]
*  It's just like obvious that they're a con artist. We are doing so good right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=568.0s)]
*  This is the greatest. All prices are low. We've solved inflation. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=574.0s)]
*  No, you're just a fast talking, two bit con artist. That's who you are. Here, play this clip of him right here. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=578.0s)]
*  Everything in the world's got 10 percent. You go to the store now, you're feeling the pain. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=584.0s)]
*  No, why not? Because there is no pain. Because what happens is the sellers, the producers, the sellers and the currencies change [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=589.0s)]
*  and the price effectively mostly goes away. I'm not you know, what's the inflation rate in America? Two odd percent. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=599.0s)]
*  OK, two odd percent. But seriously, for the month of May, well, every product in the world's got 10 percent on it right now. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=605.0s)]
*  With no exceptions, no exclusions. This that we have 25 percent on cars and that are coming in from out. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=612.0s)]
*  Do any of you feel anything? Because I want you to understand in the month of May, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=618.0s)]
*  the United States of America is going to take in 35 billion dollars towards our deficit of tariff revenue in the month of May. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=625.0s)]
*  And consumers will feel that. Well, I said it's already on. This is on since April. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=637.0s)]
*  So when it's not that the tariff is coming, it's on. Have any of you felt any of it? Seriously? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=643.0s)]
*  Seriously. And folks, I think the people are seeing and I think the people are getting it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=650.0s)]
*  We've seen yet another ruby red Senate district flip blue. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=655.0s)]
*  Get this. A Democrat named Sam Sutton has won New York Senate's District 22 special election earlier this week by 33 points. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=661.0s)]
*  Now, Trump won this seat by 55 in 2024. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=671.0s)]
*  This was an 88 percent overperformance for Democrats in terms of Trump didn't actually win the seat in terms of in that district. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=676.0s)]
*  The people who voted for Trump, that was a red area in New York and people like, uh, this guy screwing us. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=683.0s)]
*  This guy's a con artist. We snapped out of it. Oh, yes. The felon is acting like a felon. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=690.0s)]
*  The sexual abuser is acting like a sexual abuser. Surprise, surprise. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=695.0s)]
*  The fraudster is acting like a fraudster. Oh, my gosh. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=700.0s)]
*  The guy who bankrupted all of his casinos and all of these companies is bankrupting us. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=704.0s)]
*  Oh, how could who could have predicted this? That this would happen? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=709.0s)]
*  The guy's a loser his whole life. He's a freaking felon. He deserves to be in prison. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=713.0s)]
*  That's why you have prisons to lock people like him up, not to send innocent people or people who have not committed crimes to concentration camps without due process. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=720.0s)]
*  Trump got due process over and over again. Liable, liable, liable, guilty, guilty, guilty. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=731.0s)]
*  He got due process. French President Emmanuel Macron, though, is like, OK, he's doing a trip to Asia and Southeast Asia. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=737.0s)]
*  He's going Europe, we're stable. That's the pitch right now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=746.0s)]
*  The pitch is America is done. That's what's going on in the international community. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=751.0s)]
*  America is over. America is done. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=757.0s)]
*  So the European Union is pitching themselves as we're stable. Do business with us. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=760.0s)]
*  China's out there pitching themselves. We're stable. Do business with us. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=766.0s)]
*  You know, you've you've heard Trump and Rubio talk about how they don't want to actually have America leading the world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=772.0s)]
*  Rubio's given speeches. He sees a multipolar world. We've got the United States, China and Russia as the leaders. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=779.0s)]
*  That's not what's shaping up, you idiots. First off, America was leading the world. Now America's isolated. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=786.0s)]
*  Now you have the European Union, you have China acting as adults in the room. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=792.0s)]
*  How crazy is that that the United States is speaking the way China used to speak and China is speaking the way the United States used to speak in China's like, whoa, you want your you want what we had? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=797.0s)]
*  We wanted what you had. What are you doing? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=810.0s)]
*  That's why Trump's such a loser. His framework for everything is being a loser in everything that he absolutely does. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=813.0s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, Trump and Xi Jinping have not spoken with each other because Xi Jinping doesn't want to talk to Trump. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=821.0s)]
*  Trust me, if Xi Jinping wanted to talk to Trump, he'd pick up the phone and give him a call. He doesn't want to talk to Trump. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=827.0s)]
*  He outmaneuver Trump. Trump capitulated. Trump caved. Xi Jinping and China did nothing. They gave nothing at all. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=832.0s)]
*  Nothing at all. If you're wondering why my chair's there and I'm sitting this way, my leg hurts from from sitting down. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=840.0s)]
*  I just noticed that you probably see the chair in the background right there. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=849.0s)]
*  Also, existing homes, the slowest sales pace for any since April 2009, slowest sales pace since April 2009. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=853.0s)]
*  Right now, really, really bad stuff. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=865.0s)]
*  Thomas Massey right here, MAGA Republican Congress member. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=868.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. This is the one MAGA Republican Congress member with the guts to oppose this bill. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=871.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. Play this clip. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=876.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I yield one and one half minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky, a man who is not afraid to speak his mind about fiscal responsibility. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=878.0s)]
*  Mr. Massey. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=886.0s)]
*  Gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 90 seconds. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=887.0s)]
*  Well, I'd love to stand here and tell the American people we can cut your taxes and we can increase spending and everything's going to be just fine. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=891.0s)]
*  But I can't do that because I'm here to deliver a dose of reality. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=899.0s)]
*  This bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term, but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=903.0s)]
*  Where have we heard that before? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=911.0s)]
*  How do you bind a future Congress to these promises? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=913.0s)]
*  This bill is a debt bomb ticking. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=916.0s)]
*  Congress can do funny math, fantasy math if it wants, but bond investors don't. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=919.0s)]
*  And this week they sent us a message. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=925.0s)]
*  Moody's downgraded our credit rating and the bond investors who buy our debt and finance finance our debt demanded higher interest rates on the 10 year note, 20 year note and the 30 year note. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=928.0s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=940.0s)]
*  Very soon the government will be paying $16,000 of interest interest alone per US family. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=942.0s)]
*  And what are we telling them? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=949.0s)]
*  Instead of taking care of that problem, we're going to give you a $1600 tax break. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=951.0s)]
*  Under the taxing and spending levels in this bill, we're going to rack up the authors say $20 trillion of new debt over the next 10 years. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=957.0s)]
*  I'm telling you it's closer to $30 trillion of new debt in the next 10 years. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=966.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, we're not rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic tonight. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=970.0s)]
*  We're putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=976.0s)]
*  If something is beautiful, if something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=980.0s)]
*  I oppose this bill. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=989.0s)]
*  Well, there you have it folks. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0QIIpJSfqw&t=991.0s)]
