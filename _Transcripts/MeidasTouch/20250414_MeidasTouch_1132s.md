# Trump has DISASTER Public Event DEFYING SCOTUS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas)
*  Donald Trump just held a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office with El Salvador's autocratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=0.0s)]
*  president Naib Bukele. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=4.84s)]
*  I am not being hyperbolic when I say that this was one of the single most shameful meetings [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=6.96s)]
*  to ever take place in the Oval Office in American history. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=11.76s)]
*  Trump spread Russian propaganda, said he'll be defying a ruling from the Supreme Court, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=15.96s)]
*  and said he's looking into sending American citizens to concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=20.32s)]
*  What we are witnessing right now is a full-blown constitutional crisis, and we must not avert [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=26.2s)]
*  our eyes to the reality unfolding in the United States of America. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=31.88s)]
*  My name is Brett Mycelis with the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=36.06s)]
*  Remember to subscribe to our YouTube channel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=38.12s)]
*  We are on the way to 5 million subscribers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=39.8s)]
*  So Trump gave Bukele a very warm greeting as he entered the White House. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  I gotta say, the difference between the respect that Trump shows to autocrats compared to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  our allies, like Ukrainian President Zelensky, for example, is striking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=50.36s)]
*  And by the way, Bukele did not wear a suit, but that did not seem to bother Trump and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=55.36s)]
*  his administration this time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=58.92s)]
*  As Midas Touch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski said, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=60.64s)]
*  What a contrast between how our allies get treated versus little dictators like Bukele. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=63.6s)]
*  Not a word about him not wearing a suit either, as he petitions the U.S. to expand his country's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=68.28s)]
*  mercenary penal colony by sending him more money. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=72.44s)]
*  In this moment, Kaitlin Collins asked Trump if he plans to ask to return Kilmar Abrego [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=75.92s)]
*  Garcia — that's the man the Trump administration admitted to sending to an El Salvadoran prison [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=79.84s)]
*  camp by, quote, mistake. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=84.04s)]
*  Trump attacked the press and then Attorney General Pam Bondi lied about Abrego Garcia's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=86.48s)]
*  past and immigration status. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=90.8s)]
*  As a reminder, he was here legally and said that it's up to El Salvador if they want [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=92.72s)]
*  to return him to the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=96.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=98.84s)]
*  Let's hear the question from this very low rated anchor at CB. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=99.84s)]
*  Do you plan to ask President Bukele to help return the man who your administration says [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  was mistakenly deported? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=111.2s)]
*  The man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Well let me ask Pam, would you ask to answer that question? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=115.5s)]
*  Sure, President. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=118.78s)]
*  First and foremost, he was illegally in our country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=119.78s)]
*  He had been illegally in our country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=123.42s)]
*  And in 2019, two courts — an immigration court and an appellate immigration court — ruled [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  that he was a member of MS-13 and he was illegally in our country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=132.26s)]
*  Right now, it was a paperwork. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=138.22s)]
*  It was additional paperwork that needed to be done. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=140.02s)]
*  That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=143.66s)]
*  That's not up to us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=147.26s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if, as El Salvador wants to return him — this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=148.26s)]
*  is international matters, foreign affairs — if they wanted to return him, we would [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=153.26s)]
*  facilitate it, meaning provide a plane. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=158.26s)]
*  So then the El Salvadoran president said that he doesn't have the power to return Abrego [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=161.46s)]
*  Garcia to the United States either. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=165.02s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=166.9s)]
*  I don't have the power to return him to the United States. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=170.1s)]
*  But you can release him inside El Salvador. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=172.74s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not releasing — I mean, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists into [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=174.7s)]
*  our country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=178.06s)]
*  I mean, you just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=179.06s)]
*  Western Hemisphere and you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=181.5s)]
*  to being the murder capital of the world? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=186.26s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, they'd love to have a criminal released into our country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's a fascinating issue. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  They would love it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  But all these people who like to consider themselves so powerful, all of a sudden they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=196.58s)]
*  are just powerless to do anything here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=199.94000000000003s)]
*  You see what's going on here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  And did you notice, by the way, what he said? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  Quote, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=204.9s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=208.18s)]
*  If they can call a wrongly deported innocent man a terrorist and send him to a foreign [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=209.18s)]
*  gulag, then nobody is safe. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  Kaitlin Collins then asked Trump about his own comments that he said the other day that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  he would listen to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump naturally insulted her. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=222.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=224.18s)]
*  Mr. President, you said that if the Supreme Court said someone needed to be returned, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=225.18s)]
*  that you would abide by that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  You said that on Air Force One just a few days ago. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  And they said it must be facilitated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=231.82s)]
*  Why don't you just say, isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=234.82s)]
*  Why can't you just say that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  Why do you go over and over and that's why nobody watches you anymore? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, you have no credibility. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=244.9s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=246.46s)]
*  Then Stephen Miller and Trump said that the Supreme Court's ruling was actually unanimous [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=247.62s)]
*  ruling in favor of the Trump administration. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=251.28s)]
*  This is one of the most heinous, bald-faced lies that we have witnessed yet. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=254.38s)]
*  I promise you, if he was your neighbor, you would move right away. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=258.1s)]
*  So you don't plan to ask for it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  But the Supreme Court is asking to... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  What was the ruling in the Supreme Court, Steve? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Was it nine to nothing? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=266.3s)]
*  Yes, it was a nine to zero. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=267.3s)]
*  In our favor? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=269.5s)]
*  In our favor, against the district court ruling, saying that no district court has the power [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=270.5s)]
*  to compel the foreign policy function of the United States. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=274.78s)]
*  As Pam said, the ruling solely stated that if this individual at El Salvador's sole discretion [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=277.54s)]
*  was sent back to our country, that we could deport him a second time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=284.38s)]
*  No version of this legally ends up with him ever living here because he is a citizen of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=288.06s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=292.58s)]
*  That is the president of El Salvador. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=293.9s)]
*  Your questions about it per the court can only be directed to him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  So that is, of course, the opposite of what happened. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=298.34s)]
*  That is utterly Orwellian and anti-American. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=300.78s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Trump must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=303.34s)]
*  There was no gray area here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=308.08s)]
*  The court wrote, quote, the rest of the district court's order remains in effect, but requires [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  clarification on remand. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=313.86s)]
*  The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=315.82s)]
*  custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=319.7s)]
*  had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=324.62s)]
*  Stephen Miller then called it, quote, arrogant for the press to ask about Abrego Garcia and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=328.06s)]
*  lied about the Supreme Court ruling some more. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=332.76s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=334.94s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=335.94s)]
*  Can you just also respond to that question? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=336.94s)]
*  Because, you know, it's asked by CNN and they always ask it with a slant because they're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=339.02s)]
*  totally slanting because they don't know what's happening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=344.34s)]
*  That's why nobody's watching them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=346.5s)]
*  But would you answer that question also, please? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=347.74s)]
*  Yes, gladly. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=350.42s)]
*  So as Pam mentioned, there's a legal alien from El Salvador. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=351.42s)]
*  So with respect to you, he's a citizen of El Salvador. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=356.3s)]
*  So it's very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=360.84s)]
*  how to handle their own citizens as a starting point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=366.66s)]
*  As two immigration courts found that he was a member of MS-13, when President Trump declared [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=369.58s)]
*  MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organization, that meant that he was no longer eligible [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=374.66s)]
*  under federal law, which I'm sure you know, you're very familiar with the INA, that he [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=380.22s)]
*  was no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the United States. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=383.86s)]

*  about this a long time ago now, four years ago, when I heard that this guy was having open borders, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  I said every single criminal from all over the world is going to be dumped into our country. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=631.88s)]
*  And that's what happened. Jails, the jails of the Congo were emptied out. And by the way, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=637.0s)]
*  here's footage that was captured on the El Salvadoran government's live stream. This did [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=642.2s)]

*  hear Trump endorse the idea of sending what he calls, quote, homegrowns. That means American [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  citizens to El Salvadoran prison camps. Watch this. Homegrowns are next. The homegrowns built, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=654.76s)]
*  you got to build about five more places. Yeah, that's better. All right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=665.24s)]
*  It's not big enough. Marco Rubio, a man who has completely sold his soul, jumped in during the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=668.44s)]

*  upset about the situation. I don't understand what the confusion is. This individual is a [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=681.96s)]

*  wasn't refusing to take people back or places like that. I can tell you this, Mr. President. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=696.04s)]
*  No, the foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the president of the United States, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=700.68s)]
*  not by a court. And no court in the United States has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=704.68s)]
*  United States. It's that simple. And the story. By the way, this is not the only court order that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=709.64s)]
*  Trump was defying today. The Associated Press reported that their journalists remain blocked [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=714.28s)]
*  from the Oval Office despite a court order demanding their reinstatement. The AP said, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=718.28s)]
*  quote, Our journalists were blocked from the Oval Office today. We expect the White House [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=722.92s)]
*  to restore AP's participation in the pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  Speaking of the media, Trump attacked CNN as fake news and said that they hate our country. Watch this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  Actually, what you're doing with the border is remarkable. It has dropped what? 95 percent? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=737.8s)]
*  Or it's incredible? As of this morning, 99 percent, 99.1 percent, to be exact. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=743.56s)]
*  What are those numbers? Not in the media? Well, they get out with the fake news. You know, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=750.68s)]
*  like CNN, CNN over here doesn't want to put them out because they don't like, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=754.68s)]
*  they don't like putting out good numbers. They only like putting out because I think they hate [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=759.2399999999999s)]
*  our country actually. Yeah, that's a good point. It's a shame. You're right. Isn't that a great [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=762.5999999999999s)]
*  question? Why doesn't the media, why don't they put out numbers? Yeah, 99 percent. I mean, it's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  crazy, right? We're doing great. The El Salvadoran president told Trump that he has 350 million [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=772.4399999999999s)]
*  people to liberate in the United States. But in order to do that, Trump must imprison people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=777.96s)]
*  Watch this. In fact, Mr. President, you have 350 million people to liberate. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=782.36s)]
*  But to liberate 350 million people, you have to imprison some. That's the way it works, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=789.64s)]
*  You cannot just free the criminals and think crime is going to go down magically. You have [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=794.76s)]
*  to imprison them so you can liberate 350 million Americans that are asking for. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=799.16s)]
*  Trump then spread Russian propaganda and refused to condemn Vladimir Putin after the horrifying [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=804.2800000000001s)]
*  attacks we witnessed this weekend in Ukraine. A Russian missile attack had killed 34 in Sumy [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=808.5200000000001s)]
*  in Ukraine on Palm Sunday, including two children. But Trump has refused to say a single bad word [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=813.08s)]
*  about the attack or about Putin. And instead he's ramping up his attacks on Zelensky. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump on social media this morning wrote, quote, President Zelensky and crooked Joe Biden did an [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=823.0s)]
*  absolutely horrible job in allowing this travesty to begin blaming Zelensky and Biden for Putin's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=827.48s)]
*  illegal invasion. Trump earlier also called Putin's attack simply a, quote, mistake. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=833.0s)]
*  He was asked about that during the Oval Office meeting, and he ended up attacking Biden and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=838.28s)]
*  Zelensky for, quote, letting the war happen. — Repeatedly mentioned last night that Russia's [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=842.04s)]
*  attack on Ukraine was a mistake. What is the exact mistake? And had you given Putin a deadline to [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=848.12s)]
*  actually move toward a ceasefire? — The mistake was letting the war happen. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=854.76s)]
*  If Biden were competent and if Zelensky were competent — and I don't know that he is. We [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=858.92s)]
*  had a rough session with this guy over here. He just kept asking for more and more. That war [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=864.6s)]
*  should have never been allowed to happen. That war — I went four years and Putin wouldn't even bring [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=869.4s)]
*  it up. And as soon as the election was rigged and I wasn't here, that war started. There was no way [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=874.28s)]
*  that war should have been allowed to happen. And Biden should have stopped it. And you take a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=881.24s)]
*  look at Putin. I'm not saying anybody's an angel, but I will tell you, I went four years and it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=888.2s)]
*  wasn't even a question. He would never — and I told him, don't do it. You're not going to do it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=893.6400000000001s)]
*  And it was the apple of his eye. — Trump then blamed Zelensky for starting the war and scolded [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  him for asking for weapons. Trump said, quote, when you start a war, you got to know you can [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=903.32s)]
*  win a war. Parroting Russian propaganda yet again and refusing to acknowledge that it was Putin [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=908.2s)]
*  who invaded Ukraine. Watch. — President Zelensky's turnabout is offered a purchase [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=913.72s)]
*  more Patriot missile batteries. — Or I don't know. He's always looking to purchase missiles. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=918.52s)]
*  You know, he's against — listen, when you start a war, you got to know that you can win the war. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=922.52s)]
*  Right? You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  and then hope that people give you some missiles. — Trump then bragged about passing another [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=931.96s)]
*  cognitive test over the weekend. Trump then bragged about passing another cognitive test [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=936.12s)]
*  over the past few days. This is one of those tests that are designed to detect signs of dementia. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=940.92s)]
*  And he bragged that he got the highest marks of anyone ever. Watch this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=944.92s)]
*  — Very low IQ, President. And by the way, I took my cognitive exam as part of my physical exam, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=948.28s)]
*  and I got the highest mark. And one of the doctors said, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=955.0s)]
*  sir, I've never seen anybody get that kind of — that was the highest mark. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=958.28s)]
*  I hope you're happy with that. Although they haven't been bugging me too much to take a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=962.5999999999999s)]
*  cognitive. But I did do my physical, and it was released. I hope you're all happy with it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=966.44s)]
*  I notice there's no question, so probably you are. But the cognitive — they said to me, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=971.08s)]
*  sir, would you like to take a cognitive test? I said, did Biden take one? No. Did anybody take one? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=976.12s)]
*  No, not too many people took them. I said, what about — what about Obama? Did he take one? No, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=983.72s)]
*  he didn't take one either. I said, let me be the only one to take one. But I've actually taken them [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=990.6s)]
*  three times already. I like taking them because they're sort of — they're not too tough for me [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=996.04s)]
*  to take. — Trump then said that he was going to raise prices on pharmaceuticals by implementing [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1000.04s)]
*  a tariff. Watch this. — Question? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1004.8399999999999s)]
*  — On tariffs? — No, not you. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1007.4s)]
*  — On the South Carolina power update today on the actual semiconductor tariffs and potentially [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1008.68s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. Semiconductor tariffs and potentially pharmaceuticals. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1014.68s)]
*  — Pharmaceuticals, we're going to do. We have — we don't make our own drugs, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1018.52s)]
*  our own pharmaceuticals. We don't make our own drugs anymore. The drug companies are in [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1022.92s)]
*  Ireland and they're in lots of other places — China. And all I have to do is impose [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdal-t0tqas&t=1027.8s)]
