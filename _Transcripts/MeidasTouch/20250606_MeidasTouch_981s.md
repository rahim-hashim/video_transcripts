# OMG! Trump RUNS AWAY from Press as SCANDAL GROWS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI)
*  Donald Trump is not taking any questions from the press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=0.0s)]
*  He basically ran away and avoided the press as he was going to his golf course in Bedminster [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=3.2s)]
*  to play more golf and vacation on the taxpayer dime. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=9.6s)]
*  Of course, reporters wanted to ask Donald Trump about Elon Musk saying that Trump's Department of Justice [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=14.4s)]
*  is intentionally covering up the Epstein files for Donald Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=20.6s)]
*  because Trump is all over the Epstein list and all over the files. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=24.8s)]
*  Also, Elon Musk called for Donald Trump's impeachment. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=30.0s)]
*  Elon Musk also said that Donald Trump would never have been elected if it wasn't for Elon Musk. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=33.2s)]
*  Let me show you what went down when Fox was trying to ask Donald Trump a question. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=39.6s)]
*  You'll see Fox and other media going to Donald Trump to ask questions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=44.0s)]
*  Trump kind of avoids them and kind of hides for them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Trump gets in the car as he goes to play golf at Bedminster on the taxpayer dime. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=51.3s)]
*  Here, watch this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=56.5s)]
*  Drew is where he is now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=57.3s)]
*  He's now going to board Air Force One, fly to his golf club at Bedminster to spend the weekend there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=58.9s)]
*  Let's see if the president's... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=65.3s)]
*  No, it doesn't look like he's going to stop and talk to reporters. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=67.3s)]
*  Looks like he is getting inside his vehicle. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=71.7s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=76.1s)]
*  I don't think we're going to get him to talk to us, unfortunately. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=78.9s)]
*  But anyway, he's going to be boarding. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  It looks like he got inside his vehicle. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=84.5s)]
*  Maybe they're going to motorcade there rather than fly Air Force One. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Now, what Donald Trump did instead was he called corporate news and they laundered his talking points for him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  He called CBS, CNN, and ABC, and he basically gave reporters there the exact same message. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  And they basically reposted it almost like doing a press release for Donald Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=107.7s)]
*  It's really frankly gross. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  You have Jonathan Karl at ABC. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=114.5s)]
*  He fortuitously got a phone call from Donald Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=117.3s)]
*  Here's how ABC's Jonathan Karl frames the issue. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  In a phone conversation this morning, Donald Trump told me Elon Musk is, quote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=124.1s)]
*  the man who has lost his mind. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=128.7s)]
*  Trump did not, however, seem angry or even concerned about the feud. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=130.5s)]
*  As for reports that there is going to be a Trump-Musk call scheduled for today, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=134.5s)]
*  Trump told me he is, quote, not particularly interested in talking to Musk, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=139.3s)]
*  although he says Musk wants to talk to him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=143.5s)]
*  Then to Robert Costa from CBS. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=146.7s)]
*  In a phone conversation, President Trump told me he is moving forward with his presidency today [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=149.7s)]
*  and, quote, totally focused on policy matters, not Musk. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=154.9s)]
*  Shrugged off the feud, brought up the economy, which he cast in a positive light, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=158.3s)]
*  quote, that's all I focus on, Trump said of the presidency. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=162.9s)]
*  I do not focus on anything else. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=166.3s)]
*  While Donald Trump was speaking to Robert Costa, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump was reposting Roger Stone, far right-wing extremist, who says, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=172.1s)]
*  it's time to put President Trump on Mount Rushmore. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=178.3s)]
*  Congresswoman Annapolina Luna has sponsored the legislation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=181.9s)]
*  to put our 45th and 47th president on this national monument. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  So sure, Robert Costa, Jonathan Karl, and I'll show you in a moment what Dana Bash said, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=189.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's just so focused on the economy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=194.9s)]
*  I mean, last weekend he was saying that former President Biden was secretly executed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=197.9s)]
*  and that a robot was actually in place of former President Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=203.9s)]
*  Stop normalizing and sanewashing the crap that we are dealing with. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=209.3s)]
*  But notice, I mean, Donald Trump has sued CBS. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=214.5s)]
*  He's in a lawsuit with CBS right now, which owns 60 Minutes, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=216.9s)]
*  He sued ABC and settled with ABC. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=220.5s)]
*  And take a look also, and he's sued CNN before. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=223.3s)]
*  This is what Dana Bash says. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=227.1s)]
*  I just got off the phone with President Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=229.1s)]
*  He told me he's, quote, not even thinking about Elon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  He's got a problem. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=235.5s)]
*  The poor guy has got a problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=236.9s)]
*  Do you notice the exact same talking points to ABC, CBS, and CNN [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  as he's not taking questions, as he's going to Bedminster, which, by the way, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=244.7s)]
*  scored a 32 of 100 from the health inspector in the county, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  like the lowest possible score with 18 separate violations? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=255.1s)]
*  You know, notably as Donald Trump's been avoiding speaking to the press about this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=260.3s)]
*  And really, since what? Last Friday, he's really been kind of in hiding and avoiding the press. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=264.7s)]
*  He did do the Frederick Mears Oval Office Presser, which was a total disaster. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=270.7s)]
*  But other than that, he's really been just kind of golfing, vacationing, avoiding the press. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=276.1s)]
*  So while this was all going on and Elon was, you know, going after Donald Trump and saying, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=281.5s)]
*  impeach Trump and saying, I got Trump elected. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=287.1s)]
*  If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't be elected. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=289.9s)]
*  Trump's all over the Epstein files. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=291.3s)]
*  And Musk was posting Epstein videos showing Donald Trump partying with Epstein as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=293.3s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel, who was a former right wing podcast host, he was on Rogan. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=299.5s)]
*  And I want you to watch the interaction where Rogan asked Patel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=305.7s)]
*  Patel has the files. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=309.1s)]
*  And many believe it's Patel and Bondi are the ones who are covering up the Epstein files [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=310.9s)]
*  because Trump's name is all over it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=315.7s)]
*  And Patel was freaked out when Rogan asked Patel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=318.3s)]
*  I want you to watch this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=321.7s)]
*  This is going to come up because it's been going on since we've been recording here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=322.9s)]
*  Elon and Trump seem to be in a little bit of a spat, Joe. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=327.5s)]
*  You want to check the tweet that Elon just put out a little bit ago? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=330.1s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=333.3s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=335.1s)]
*  That's the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=337.5s)]
*  Have a nice day. Jesus Christ. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=339.9s)]
*  I'm not participating in any of that conversation between Elon and Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=342.5s)]
*  What is he? Have a nice day? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=346.1s)]
*  DJD? So much day gets thrown away. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=347.5s)]
*  They're going back and forth about different things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=349.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=351.1s)]
*  Well, he said he was disappointed in Elon. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=351.7s)]
*  Yeah, he told him to leave. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=354.1s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that's a crazy thing to say. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=355.5s)]
*  How does he know? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=357.5s)]
*  Does he know that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=358.5s)]
*  Or does he have access to the Epstein files? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=360.9s)]
*  I don't know how he would, but I'm just staying out of the Trump-Elon thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=362.9s)]
*  That's way outside my lane. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=366.5s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=367.5s)]
*  I know my lane and that ain't it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=369.5s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=370.7s)]
*  I mean, I understand he owns Twitter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=372.5s)]
*  I think it's bad for your mental health. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=375.1s)]
*  I think posting things public all day and arguing with people all day is bad for you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=377.1s)]
*  Well, you raise a great point. Sorry to cut you off. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=381.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=383.5s)]
*  Half of what we have to respond to is the click army on social media. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=384.9s)]
*  And again, in the absence of Donald Trump saying anything and avoiding the press and running away, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  here's far right-wing influencer and Trump or Charlie Kirk. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  This is how they're trying to spin Trump being in the Epstein files. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=399.9s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=403.9s)]
*  Now, 10 years later, we're supposed to believe there's going to be a smoking gun of something in the Epstein files. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=404.7s)]
*  But what is in the Epstein files is yes, President Donald Trump is probably mentioned. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=410.7s)]
*  He was mentioned in the Epstein file dump back in February. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=415.1s)]
*  You know why? He lived in Palm Beach. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=417.9s)]
*  There's probably thousands of names in the Epstein files. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=420.3s)]
*  Was he part of the Epstein client list? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=423.5s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=425.5s)]
*  That is complete nonsense. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=426.7s)]
*  But to say that Donald Trump is not releasing the Epstein files because he's in them in some incriminating way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=428.3s)]
*  Yes, it's very clear that if you live in Palm Beach, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=436.5s)]
*  you might have been mentioned and caught up in some sort of conversation with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=440.7s)]
*  And then Charlie Kirk tries to kind of give advice to Donald Trump as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=445.5s)]
*  Like he goes, I just think you should largely ignore, be the better person at this point, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=449.5s)]
*  and maybe it will all go away. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=454.5s)]
*  Let's talk about the perspective here of where we as a movement go next. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=456.1s)]
*  Is it best to largely ignore this? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=463.8s)]
*  I think that's probably best. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=465.9s)]
*  We kind of have the blow up dust up. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=467.7s)]
*  Again, this alternatively could have been like a two week feud and it still might be. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  But like again, when you accuse someone of being in the Epstein files, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  oh, and they also want him to be impeached, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=476.7s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=478.5s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=478.9s)]
*  Interestingly, though, he might still be pro JD because he was like, I want Trump replaced with JD. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=480.5s)]
*  So whatever. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=486.29999999999995s)]
*  Long work weeks and busy weekends can leave you feeling and looking depleted. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=487.29999999999995s)]

*  You know, now notably, remember I showed you what ABC, CBS and CNN were saying. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=589.9000000000001s)]
*  Let me show you what Fox was saying as well. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=595.7s)]
*  So you can see literally there's really no difference anymore between those networks and Fox. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=598.5s)]
*  Here is Kayleigh McEnany, who's Donald Trump's former press secretary, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=605.3s)]
*  giving basically the same talking points on air that I just read from you from CBS, CNN and ABC, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  as Trump was running away from the press and hiding, playing this clip. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  We bring you some breaking news, this time from Brett Baer, who just spoke to President Trump on the phone. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=622.9s)]
*  He reflected on Elon Musk and here's what Brett learned in that phone call. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=628.5s)]
*  Trump is not interested in talking to Elon. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=633.3s)]
*  Trump is not worried about threats of a third party. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  Now that comes because Elon Musk tweeted this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=639.3s)]
*  He put up a poll and he said it is time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=642.9s)]
*  He asked that as a question of his followers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=649.9s)]
*  So he asked about a potential third party. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  President Trump says he's not worried to Brett Baer. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=654.5s)]
*  President Trump also pointed to his favorable polls and his strong support among Capitol Hill Republicans. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=657.1s)]
*  Noteworthy, Elon Musk called for constituents to call congressmen and women. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=663.5s)]
*  Whether those calls have materialized, I've seen reports that they have not. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=668.7s)]
*  Would also note, underscoring President Trump's point, he's ahead in the real clear politics average of Obama and Bush at this point in the second term. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  And finally, a direct quote from Brett Baer from President Trump. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=678.7s)]
*  The quote from President Trump is this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=683.1s)]
*  Elon has totally lost it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=685.1s)]
*  So more on that feud as the day progresses. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=688.4s)]
*  But for now, now again, while all of this was going on as well, you had one of Trump's top advisors, Peter Navarro, go on Fox Business and Maria Bartiroma said, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=691.5s)]
*  Hey, when are you going to be announcing these deals? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=704.1s)]
*  Like what's going on here? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=706.7s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=708.2s)]
*  Are you expecting more trade deals in the near term? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=709.6s)]
*  Because Peter, we keep hearing that, you know, India could be next and the EU is doing this fast tracking. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=712.6s)]
*  When are we going to have more deals to talk about in terms of tariff deals? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=719.0s)]
*  Well, the United States Trade Representative Building, I don't know if you ever been over this right across the street. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=724.7s)]
*  It's a historic building. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=731.2s)]
*  It played a really important role in the Civil War. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=732.2s)]
*  But it looks more like a deli now where you go in and you get your number and you stand in line and you do that so you can negotiate with James and Greer, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=735.0s)]
*  the USTR and Howard Ludnick, the Secretary of Commerce. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=744.8s)]
*  And that's where we're doing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=748.1s)]
*  We're we've got a formula and a template. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=749.6s)]
*  We go through five different verticals to make sure the American people are protected and we will have deals. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=752.4s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=760.1s)]
*  Usually it takes months and years in this administration. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=762.0s)]
*  It's going to take more like days. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  We're on task and on target. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=767.9s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know what we want, Marie. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=770.1s)]
*  All we want is fairness. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  We have the highest tariffs facing us in the world, the highest trade barriers. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=774.4s)]
*  It's not a China problem. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=779.5s)]
*  It's a world problem. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=781.5s)]
*  And we're going to fix it because that's what President Trump does. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=783.1s)]
*  All right, Pete. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=786.5s)]
*  Now, here is something that Trump posted moments ago as well. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=787.1s)]
*  He made this post from David Schoen, who I believe represented Trump in other matters before. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=790.9s)]
*  But here's what David Schoen said. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  He goes, I was hired to lead Jeffrey Epstein's defense as his criminal lawyer for nine days before he died. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  He sought my advice for months before that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=806.6999999999999s)]
*  I can say authoritatively and unequivocally and definitively that he had no information to hurt President Trump. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=810.4s)]
*  I specifically asked him. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=818.5s)]
*  It's kind of suspicious. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=821.7s)]
*  I mean, you were with him. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=823.0s)]
*  You were the criminal lawyer who was there nine days before he died. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=824.9s)]
*  And notice he doesn't say that I was his lawyer months before that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=828.4s)]
*  I mean, it says over here, he sought my advice for months before that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=833.2s)]
*  Again, I'm not clear if he was or wasn't the lawyer months before that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=838.2s)]
*  Then just release the files then. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=842.9s)]
*  Then just release the files. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=845.2s)]
*  But I'll tell you what. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=846.6s)]
*  Here at the Midas Touch Network, I had the opportunity to ask Michael Wolff, who spoke with Epstein. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=847.7s)]
*  And Wolff tells me that he's got his author Michael Wolff. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=854.1s)]
*  Epstein wanted an autobiography written on him in case something happened to him. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=857.9000000000001s)]
*  Wolff was debating whether or not he was going to write the autobiography. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=862.0s)]
*  So they spoke in the context of Epstein speaking to Michael Wolff and giving him information. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=865.8000000000001s)]
*  And we have those audio recordings. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=871.0s)]
*  I played you before. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=872.7s)]
*  So here's what author Michael Wolff told me when I interviewed him. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=873.7s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=877.0s)]
*  And he sat for many, many hours of discussion with me. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=877.8s)]
*  I mean, certainly 80, 90, probably 100 hours I have of Epstein on tape. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=883.8s)]
*  And one of the discussions, because this was occurring, Trump became the president in 2017. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=892.6s)]
*  I began writing about Trump. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=902.6s)]
*  And so we spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump and Epstein's relationship with Trump, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=906.6s)]
*  which went on for a good certainly 15 years and was incredibly close. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=913.8s)]
*  They were each other's closest friend for a very long time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=919.6999999999999s)]
*  And Epstein, I think Epstein is one of those people who truly knew Donald Trump, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=925.8s)]
*  knew many secrets about Donald Trump and was threatening to Donald Trump. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=934.5s)]
*  A very different story. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=942.4s)]
*  But Trump seems to be scared running away from the press. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=943.9s)]
*  We'll keep you posted every step of the way here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=947.1s)]
*  But this story has legs. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=949.3s)]
*  And that's why we've been covering it every day very diligently here at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N_mPAh-gwI&t=951.9s)]
