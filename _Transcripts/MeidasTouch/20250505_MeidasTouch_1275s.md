# SECRET Plan for Trump to DESTROY Elections REVEALED
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo)
*  By now, I'm sure you all saw the clip of this weekend of Donald Trump saying he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=0.0s)]
*  doesn't know if he needs to uphold the constitution. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=4.16s)]
*  But in all of the chaos and disaster that Donald Trump has caused in the federal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=7.8s)]
*  government and the constant crises each and every day, I don't want us to lose [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=12.36s)]
*  sight of one of the biggest stories that's not being reported, and that's that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=17.56s)]
*  Donald Trump has worked to systematically dismantle the FEC, the Federal Elections [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=21.8s)]
*  Commission, which no longer even has a quorum for it to conduct business, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=29.16s)]
*  evaluate complaints and act on it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=35.52s)]
*  So with all of this dark money coming into politics and specifically hoisting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=38.36s)]
*  up Donald Trump and his MAGA movement, they've been making moves behind the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=44.44s)]
*  scenes to dismantle even more and already dismantled Federal Elections Commission. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=49.92s)]
*  I want to analyze how we got here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=56.56s)]
*  First, let me share with you the clip that you've seen this weekend. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=59.32s)]
*  I want to take a little historical detour. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=62.88s)]
*  I want to show you McCain-Feingold's bipartisan legislation passed in 2002, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=66.0s)]
*  which was again, systematically dismantled by the Supreme Court and the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=73.04s)]
*  Citizens United case and another horrific voting rights cases. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=76.56s)]
*  But first, let me show you the Trump clip from this weekend and let's go back to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=79.36s)]
*  the future, then into the present. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=83.56s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=85.0s)]
*  But even given those numbers that you're talking about, don't you need to uphold [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=86.12s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States as president? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=93.08s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=100.84s)]
*  What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=104.64s)]
*  They have a different interpretation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  Now let's rewind to 2007, the late great Senator John McCain, Republican, because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=110.0s)]
*  this stuff didn't used to be political or partisan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=116.64s)]
*  John McCain was on all places, Fox News at the time, and he was asked in 2007, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=119.64s)]
*  do you still support this bipartisan piece of legislation you did with Russ [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=125.4s)]
*  Feingold, a Democratic Senator, to try to remove all of this dark money from [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=130.12s)]
*  politics and to create a system that really checked some of the most damaging [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=134.88s)]
*  aspects of corporate influence and oligarch influence in the elections. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=140.36s)]
*  This is McCain 2007 on Fox. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=144.0s)]
*  Play the clip. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=146.12s)]
*  If you had it all to do over again, would you still go for McCain Feingold? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=147.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=150.76s)]
*  You've seen the corruption in Washington. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=152.76s)]
*  We have former members of Congress in federal prison. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=154.6s)]
*  The approval rating of Congress is down around 11% because the law was not fully [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=157.4s)]
*  implemented and the 74 law on these so-called 527s are disgraced and they have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=163.0s)]
*  to be eliminated because they're clearly in violation of the law. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=170.72s)]
*  Then comes the Citizen United decision by the Supreme Court in 2010, and lots of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=175.0s)]
*  people were warning what a disaster this decision was going to be. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=180.52s)]
*  It essentially said that, look, corporations and all these dark money groups, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=184.08s)]
*  they're like people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=188.64s)]
*  They have a free speech right to say whatever the hell they want in the elections. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=190.04s)]
*  People were warning, you know what they're going to do? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=196.32s)]
*  They're going to use that as a license to deceive and interfere with elections and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=198.76s)]
*  trick people and billionaires who've amassed all this wealth are going to buy their [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=203.96s)]
*  power. Exactly what McCain Feingold bipartisan legislation was created to stop. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=208.44s)]
*  So what did we have in the 2024 election? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the role that we've now [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=218.32s)]
*  seen is what he wanted to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=224.24s)]
*  Doge, destroy the federal government and take your data. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=225.68s)]
*  And how they do it with everything these groups warned against the RBG pact. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=229.2s)]
*  Remember that that Elon Musk created? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=234.44s)]
*  He was claiming that RBG, Ruth Bader Ginsburg actually supported Donald Trump and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=237.36s)]
*  they ran ads that great minds think alike. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=242.64s)]
*  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Donald Trump were the same people were on the same team. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=245.72s)]
*  I mean, that's what they were doing to the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who would [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  have been someone standing up and she was someone who stood up to Donald Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Then Elon Musk would announce on stage, I'm giving one million dollars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. I have a surprise for you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=263.76s)]
*  Which is that we're going to be awarding a million dollars. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=268.12s)]
*  To randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=272.76s)]
*  They ran that playbook, deceitful playbook with success in the 2024 election. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  And then they tried to run it again in all of these state races. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=293.52s)]
*  Fortunately, wasn't successful in the Wisconsin judicial race, but he was able to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=296.24s)]
*  here's what they were doing in Wisconsin, where they were talking about how have you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=302.6s)]
*  voted for the Republican MAGA candidate, you'd get a million dollars. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=307.12s)]
*  This was someone named Ekaterina Dysler who said she got a million dollars from Elon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=310.28s)]
*  Watch the ads they were putting out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=316.28s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=317.72s)]
*  My name is Ekaterina Dysler. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=319.08s)]
*  I'm from Green Bay, Wisconsin. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=320.64s)]
*  I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=322.64s)]
*  Signed petition, refer friends and family vote. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=325.4s)]
*  And now I have a million dollars. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=329.08s)]
*  What? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=332.6s)]
*  Let's bring the president from end Citizens United here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=333.96s)]
*  Tiffany Mueller, about to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of your group. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=338.48s)]
*  All of this can be traced, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=343.68s)]
*  To the Citizens United decision. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=346.08s)]
*  We, this has been going on for a long time, but when you see all of that, what's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=349.56s)]
*  your reaction to it? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=353.56s)]
*  And then I want to pivot and talk about what's been going on even more with the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=354.6s)]
*  federal elections commission. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=358.36s)]
*  Well, first Ben, thanks so much for having me on today. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=360.36s)]
*  It's, even though these aren't always fun topics to talk about, they are [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=363.32s)]
*  critically important topics to talk about. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=367.92s)]
*  And it's so good to be here with you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=369.92s)]
*  I mean, I think that what we're seeing right now in this moment in our country [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  is exactly what 15 years under the Citizens United ruling does to a country [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  where you have the richest man in the world, who, as you said, spent almost [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=382.68s)]
*  $300 million to elect the president of the United States and then is rewarded [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  with unprecedented access and power and the ability to line his own pockets with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=392.6s)]
*  more government contracts and big data that he can go monetize in his private [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=399.56s)]
*  businesses. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=405.44s)]
*  And we're seeing that play out in cabinet position after cabinet position and with [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=407.12s)]
*  Trump rewarding himself, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=413.32000000000005s)]
*  This is about 100 days of chaos, corruption, but continued rising prices on the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  American people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=423.68s)]
*  So I think we've seen what they're prioritizing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=425.04s)]
*  They're prioritizing themselves. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  They're prioritizing who can write the biggest check. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  But it's all coming at the expense of the American people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=431.56s)]
*  And our organization, to your point, is 10 years old. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  And we are a grassroots powered movement that is actually just made up of everyday [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=439.12s)]
*  hardworking Americans, retired teachers, firefighters, folks who give $10 or $15 at [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=444.48s)]
*  a time because they care about the future of our democracy and they care about having [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=451.56s)]
*  a democracy that doesn't just work for those who can write the biggest check, but [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=456.92s)]
*  really is about everyone having the same power and voice in our democracy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=461.6s)]
*  Tell us about what's been going on with just the composition of the Federal [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  Elections Commission and what it means. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=472.92s)]
*  Obviously, we've reported before Donald Trump fired one of the Democratic members, a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=475.8s)]
*  strong advocate just for fair processes and democracy, Commissioner Weintraub. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=483.16s)]
*  But then we saw a lot of Republican commissioners resign. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=489.72s)]
*  And now there's no quorum. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  There's only like three people on the panel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=496.36s)]
*  So they're not even able to meet and make decisions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=498.92s)]
*  So they have all these backlogs of complaints and they can't even make advisory opinions. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=501.8s)]
*  Like they literally shut like they're doing nothing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  Like, can you talk to them? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=509.32s)]
*  They are absolutely doing nothing at this point in time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=510.92s)]
*  Look, you know, the Federal Elections Commission isn't one of those sexy agencies that's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  in the headlines every single day, but it's now 50 years old and it was formed in the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=520.36s)]
*  wake of the Watergate scandal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=526.28s)]
*  And when our country took a bipartisan approach to cleaning up corruption and restoring [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=528.6400000000001s)]
*  faith and trust in our government and in Congress in particular, it was a bipartisan [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  system. You have three Democrats and three Republicans and it takes four of them to open [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  investigations or to say that someone broke the law and have a fine or things like that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=546.48s)]
*  And what Donald Trump has done is he has gutted the agency. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=554.6s)]
*  But what we've seen over the past 10 years is an agency riddled by dysfunction anyway. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=558.44s)]
*  So we have seen that it has been mostly stalemated with the three Republicans and three [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  Democratic commissioners, often voting 3-3 and having nothing move forward. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=570.0400000000001s)]
*  But now they've gone even further. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=577.12s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's trying to take over all these independent agencies. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=579.0s)]
*  And what he's done in the case of the Federal Elections Commission is he said, well, we're [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=583.24s)]
*  going to just outright fire the biggest advocate who's taking on corruption, who's calling [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=587.92s)]
*  out the abuses of money in politics when he fired Commissioner Weintraub. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=594.36s)]
*  And then they're just going to leave the other vacancies open. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=599.2s)]
*  Right. Because, again, if there's not at least four members on that commission, they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=602.28s)]
*  can't do anything. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=606.96s)]
*  They can't do any business whatsoever. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=608.32s)]
*  And so this is one more step that Donald Trump has taken to really gut the watchdogs [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  who are at the heart of our government trying to clean up corruption. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=617.96s)]
*  We saw it with Federal Elections Commission. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=622.28s)]
*  We've seen it with inspectors generals in independent agencies. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  And we see it in weaponizing the DOJ time and time again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=628.4s)]
*  You know, when I do interviews of international leaders, whether it's in Canada, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=632.76s)]
*  Australia or many places in Europe, they're very just kind of confused at our system [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=638.3599999999999s)]
*  in general that our election system, these commissioners, that they are part of a [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=645.52s)]
*  political apparatus. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=652.88s)]
*  Like, just conceptually, that's not a thing in many other democracies that that are [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=654.56s)]
*  working. You know, in Canada, the Elections Commission is the least political [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=661.56s)]
*  as nothing to do with politics. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=667.92s)]
*  And it wouldn't even be considered a political thing that a prime minister has powers [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=669.84s)]
*  to influence like that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=674.92s)]
*  And in other countries as well. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=676.68s)]
*  And here in the United States, we think that's imbued in the system. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=678.8s)]
*  And you've seen even where you have a Republican like McCain and a Democrat like [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=683.4s)]
*  Feingold in 2002 identify the problem is they did their jobs. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=689.6s)]
*  They dictated in advance exactly the clips that I then showed what was going to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=696.28s)]
*  happen. Then we have a political Supreme Court right wing where no one was even [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=701.64s)]
*  talking about it the way they are today. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=707.24s)]
*  In 2010, still a Roberts court saying, you know what, that bipartisan effort [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=709.2s)]
*  violates the freedom of speech rights of corporations to deceive. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=715.72s)]
*  Gotcha. So we're going to stop the legislation when finally Democrats and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=720.0s)]
*  Republicans work together to do something. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=725.28s)]
*  The Supreme Court goes, nah, screw it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=727.52s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  It it is so crazy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=731.52s)]
*  And also, I think that you said, I mean, first, you said that folks in other [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=733.48s)]
*  countries don't understand how our system is working. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=739.28s)]
*  I mean, me too. Half the time, I don't understand what's going on with our [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=742.36s)]
*  system. But what we do know is that this amount of money and this dark money and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=745.92s)]
*  corruption and just outright corruption that we see is absolutely undermining our [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=751.8s)]
*  democracy. There are reasons why other countries are keeping that money out. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=756.88s)]
*  And it's what you said. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=761.0s)]
*  It's so that they have a functioning democracy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=762.4399999999999s)]
*  They actually put rules around whether or not you can run TV ads or for what amount [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=765.7199999999999s)]
*  of time. They put rules around who can give money and who can't. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=770.24s)]
*  And we have this wild, wild West system at the moment that really has come down to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=774.7199999999999s)]
*  to one thing, which is how does money drive the policy outcomes that the richest and [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=781.28s)]
*  the biggest corporations want to have happen? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=788.68s)]
*  And, you know, you're absolutely right. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=791.96s)]
*  Even the Supreme Court was talking about money and politics differently when they [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=794.36s)]
*  decided the Citizens United case than they do today. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=798.92s)]
*  And I'll give two examples. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=802.8s)]
*  Number one, the court said in that opinion that money itself wasn't a corrupting [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=804.24s)]
*  factor and didn't necessarily lead to Americans not trusting their government. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=811.24s)]
*  Well, I think we all know that was just flat wrong. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=816.76s)]
*  Right. Number two, they they said that this money that flooded into our system would [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=819.48s)]
*  be disclosed and we'd be able to trace it back to where it originated from. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=826.12s)]
*  Well, what we know is that that's not true either. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=831.4s)]
*  We have more dark, undisclosed money flooding into our system than we've ever had. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=833.88s)]
*  There's actually about 75 percent of the money that was in this last election cycle [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=839.48s)]
*  in 2024 that we don't have full transparency into where it came from. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=844.92s)]
*  And that's letting in more corporate money, more foreign money, more foreign [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=850.4s)]
*  government money. And it is just completely corrupting the system. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, one thing we haven't talked about, Ben, is also how this money impacts [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=861.64s)]
*  every single other policy priority that we have. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=865.4s)]
*  You know, I always think about climate change. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=868.56s)]
*  Prior to Citizens United, there were 14 instances of Senate Republicans joining with [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=871.4s)]
*  Senate Democrats to try to address climate change and what it's doing to our earth. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  And then Citizens United happens. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=882.88s)]
*  Big oil and gas becomes the number one spender in our elections. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=885.24s)]
*  And would you like to guess how many times Senate Republicans have joined with Senate [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=889.44s)]
*  Democrats since then to try to fix this pressing issue? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=893.6s)]
*  I'm going to guess it is a whopping zero burger. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=898.12s)]
*  It is it is zero, Ben. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=901.0s)]
*  It is exactly zero. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=902.88s)]
*  And you can go down the line. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=904.76s)]
*  Prescription drug prices, gun violence, even reproductive freedom. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=906.04s)]
*  We know that the right wing spent over one point one billion dollars first to stack [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=912.08s)]
*  the Supreme Court and then to actually tee up the court cases to overturn Roe v. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=918.32s)]
*  Wade. So even in reproductive freedom, you see the amount of money in our politics [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  absolutely causing gridlock dysfunction and hampering our ability to make real [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=931.0400000000001s)]
*  progress. You know, I think about the song that was used for The Apprentice. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=936.44s)]
*  Money, money, money, money, money. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=940.9200000000001s)]
*  And then I also think about the Supreme Court. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=944.2800000000001s)]
*  They do this over and over again. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=947.28s)]
*  They did it here with campaign finance. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=949.4s)]
*  They did it with the absolute immunity ruling when people were saying, you know, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=952.0799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to abuse it if you give him absolute immunity. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=957.12s)]
*  He's going to start doing illegal things and claim it's in the interest of national [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=961.3199999999999s)]
*  security in the Supreme Court. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=965.56s)]
*  The same way in Citizens United said, we don't think money is a corrupting factor. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=967.12s)]
*  They said, we think that's hypothetical. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=971.4799999999999s)]
*  Our bigger concern is, are we going to chill the legitimate functions of the executive [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  branch if he doesn't have absolute immunity? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=980.2800000000001s)]
*  We're not worried that it'll be abused. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=983.32s)]
*  And then you had the liberals on the court saying, hello, he's saying he wants to be [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=985.5600000000001s)]
*  a dictator on day one. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=989.52s)]
*  And the majority saying, we just we don't we don't see it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=991.2s)]
*  And it's like, how out of touch are you? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=994.72s)]
*  Clearly, rich people are going to try to buy elections like and they do it over and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=997.12s)]
*  over again. I want to talk about, though, the dictator part of this, because that's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1002.48s)]
*  where this is heading. Right. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, where it's there. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1008.0s)]
*  But the question that our viewers have on their mind is, are there even going to be [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1010.2s)]
*  elections in the future? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1015.32s)]
*  And Donald Trump talks about how he wants, you know, he's now he's doing, you know, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  he does that. He always test bubbles things with the jokes. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1021.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, third term, third term. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  Ha ha ha. I'm being funny. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1027.56s)]
*  Oh, he's trolling. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1029.16s)]
*  And then it starts to become real and real and real. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1030.32s)]
*  And then before you know it, you've got mega Republicans saying, let's reopen [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1033.0s)]
*  Alcatraz, let's tariff the world dictator on day one. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1037.04s)]
*  Let's do it. So the gutting of the FEC, I believe, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1040.8s)]
*  and the destruction of all of this, its natural conclusion is the kind of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1046.28s)]
*  oligarch king authoritarian system is what they want. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1052.08s)]
*  I think the resistance has been strong. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1056.88s)]
*  Groups like yours have stepped up. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  Nonprofits in other spaces have stepped up to push back. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1061.8s)]
*  But that's where they want to go. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1064.96s)]
*  So what are you doing to stop this? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1066.48s)]
*  What's the plan? Yeah, that that's exactly where they want to go. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  They want to both weaponize the powers of government to attack their [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1071.96s)]
*  their first their perceived enemies. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1078.88s)]
*  Right. We see them doing that day in and day out. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1081.68s)]
*  And they also are using it to line their own pockets. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1085.08s)]
*  I mean, so much of this is a grift for them and their cronies to get rich. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1088.1599999999999s)]
*  And so, look, we have to do a few things. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1092.9599999999998s)]
*  Number one, we need a check on Trump and this corrupt administration. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1095.72s)]
*  And we can get that by winning back the House in November 20, 26. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1101.52s)]
*  And so I didn't Citizens United. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1105.84s)]
*  We there are three big buckets we work in. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1107.8s)]
*  One is electoral. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1110.76s)]
*  One is on the Hill trying to pass good legislation [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1113.04s)]
*  or at the stage trying to pass good legislation. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1116.64s)]
*  And the third is calling out the corruption [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1120.08s)]
*  and raising these issues up in the day to day narrative. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1122.84s)]
*  And so on the elections front, we absolutely have to win back the House. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1126.4s)]
*  And I think that we can do it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1130.24s)]
*  But I don't want anyone to think that this is going to be an easy fight. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1132.44s)]
*  The battleground map is hard. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1135.84s)]
*  And despite what we see every single day, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1137.92s)]
*  too many Americans out there right now aren't sure who to trust [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1140.92s)]
*  or who is fighting for them. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
*  So we have to go tell them every single day [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  how corrupt this administration is, how much it's hurting them [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1149.3200000000002s)]
*  and how we as Democrats have a plan to change it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  Number two, we have to win elections in these battleground states [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1157.5600000000002s)]
*  for these key constitutional offices, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1161.5200000000002s)]
*  governors, secretaries of state, attorneys general. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1165.4s)]
*  It matters who sits in these seats because it's going to be the very people [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1169.28s)]
*  who are administering and certifying the next election, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1173.92s)]
*  the next presidential election in twenty twenty eight. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1178.24s)]
*  We know how important it was that in twenty twenty two, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  folks like Jocelyn Benson beat election denier [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1185.04s)]
*  Christina Caramo in Michigan for secretary of state. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1189.2s)]
*  We know how important those wins were, and we have to go do that again. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1193.08s)]
*  And then every single day, the folks watching you, the folks out there, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1197.84s)]
*  we have to join together and raise our voices to make sure [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1201.72s)]
*  that we are pushing back on this corruption that we are seeing [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshtiIWe-Jo&t=1205.24s)]
