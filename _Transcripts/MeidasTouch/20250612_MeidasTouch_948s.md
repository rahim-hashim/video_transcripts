# LOL! Trump gets CLOCKED IN THE FACE by his OWN TRICKS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw)
*  Uh-oh, Donald, he did it again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=0.0s)]
*  You think you're the only person who could use social media to troll? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Well, you do it with lies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=6.96s)]
*  What happens when someone like California Governor Gavin Newsom does it with the facts, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=9.36s)]
*  and is relentless, and mocks you, and clocks you in the face with the truth, clobbers you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=14.92s)]
*  with the facts? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=21.48s)]
*  He did it again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=23.36s)]
*  He did it yesterday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=24.36s)]
*  He's doing it today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=25.36s)]
*  He did it the day before that as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=26.36s)]
*  Let's take a look here at what California Governor Gavin Newsom's team is doing on social [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=29.08s)]
*  media. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=32.92s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=33.92s)]
*  So this is what they posted. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=34.92s)]
*  They said, Pete, referring to Hegseth, send the Marines, Pete, send the Marines. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=35.92s)]
*  They're showing what the peaceful protests look like in Los Angeles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=40.96s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  And then California Governor Gavin Newsom's account posts the following. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  It's a Simpsons meme. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=59.08s)]
*  Old man yells at clouds. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=61.36s)]
*  Old man yells at cloud. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=64.16s)]
*  And every time Donald Trump makes one of these ridiculous posts, or Stephen Miller does a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=65.96s)]
*  post, Governor Newsom's team translates Donald Trump's post, or just has it read rather, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=72.4s)]
*  in the voice of Darth Vader or the bad guys from Star Wars. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=80.76s)]
*  So Trump will post, the incompetent governor of California was unable to provide protection [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=86.16s)]
*  in a timely manner. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  So Governor Newsom says, sounds like that's coming from the Death Star. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=93.28s)]
*  And Governor Newsom goes, the incompetent governor of California. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=96.84s)]
*  And then just watch how he does it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=100.36s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=101.56s)]
*  The incompetent governor of California was unable to provide protection in a timely manner. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=102.56s)]
*  I'm only going to show a short portion of that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  But you get the point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=115.36s)]
*  And then you have cosplay dog killer Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dressing in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=117.16s)]
*  her different outfits. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=123.8s)]
*  And then Governor Newsom's office writes, their entire world is driven by fiction. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=125.12s)]
*  And for those who were just listening this on audio, it's all of the little outfits that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=132.86s)]
*  Kristi Noem dresses up in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=137.34s)]
*  She's ice agent. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=139.4s)]
*  She's border patrol agent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=141.0s)]
*  She's cowgirl. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  She is SWAT team. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=144.64s)]
*  Which Barbie dress up is she going to do today? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=147.38s)]
*  And then the way Governor Newsom's office does it is they have like capital T, lower [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  case H, capital E, lower case IR, capital E. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=154.54s)]
*  You should go and watch it on YouTube. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  You'll get the better point of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  And then they just show all the ridiculous things that Donald Trump says. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  So they'll post this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  Because primarily crime is running for governor and they just mock Donald Trump relentlessly, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=169.6s)]
*  but show how dangerous is and they show this video, play this clip. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  And what crime has he committed that would warrant his arrest? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=179.2s)]
*  What crime has Governor Newsom committed? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=182.24s)]
*  The crime is he committed? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=184.56s)]
*  Yeah, to warrant his arrest. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=185.56s)]
*  I think his primary crime is running for governor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=187.24s)]
*  Then they get into some serious topics that deserve attention as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=191.28s)]
*  Like Donald Trump is diverting National Guard resources in California away from the Ranch [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=195.52s)]
*  Fire in San Bernardino. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Governor Newsom posts, the Ranch Fire in San Bernardino is 4,000 acres and growing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=206.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, five of California's 14 National Guard fire crews are understaffed because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=213.24s)]
*  Trump deployed them for a political stunt in LA. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=219.68s)]
*  This isn't just illegal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=223.44s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=225.44s)]
*  And Governor Newsom's not holding back when Trump and MAGA spread the lies about his wife. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=226.72s)]
*  So you have the Trump disinformation engine like people like Richard Grinnell, and we [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=232.4s)]
*  showed other people who were posting this the day before. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=236.96s)]
*  Grinnell goes, Dear God, it's a photo of Gavin Newsom's wife from January that they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=240.24s)]
*  tried to pretend happened this week. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=247.32s)]
*  Dear God. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=249.2s)]
*  She came to Los Angeles to shop using her $4,000 purse at Gavin Newsom and his wife. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=250.2s)]
*  Don't care about the chaos. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=256.52s)]
*  And then all the Trump disinformation people all post the same thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=258.64s)]
*  Then Elon amplifies that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=262.8s)]
*  And if you don't respond like right away, that becomes the narrative. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  And lots of people who are, you know, doing the work, like governing, unlike Donald Trump, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=269.78s)]
*  who's just a idiotic troll. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=275.08s)]
*  Most people who are governing are like doing the hard work. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=277.76s)]
*  They're out there in the command centers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  They're preparing things so they don't think, Oh my God, I got to swat down like literal [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  propaganda and all this disinformation. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=286.76s)]
*  But you've got to do that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=289.8s)]
*  And so Governor Newsom's office comes out swinging again. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=291.44s)]
*  They go, This story is an outright lie and needs to be retracted entirely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=295.24s)]
*  This photo is from months ago when the first partner was picking up skincare products. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  She is recovering from a past skin cancer diagnosis. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=306.4s)]
*  You sick people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  It's why Libs of TikTok's already deleted their false post. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  So remember two days ago when I showed you what Libs of TikTok had posted. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=315.76s)]
*  The Newsom's office got Libs of TikTok to take it down, but Grinnell hadn't got the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=321.84s)]
*  message so Grinnell reposted it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  And then Grinnell tries to post a New York Post article that was removed and retracted. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=329.2s)]
*  And Grinnell says, This is just pathetic spin from Governor Newsom's wife blaming skin cancer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=335.48s)]
*  And Governor Newsom goes, Again, it's a straight up lie. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=341.66s)]
*  The New York Post, Richard, deleted their story, the one you posted. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=350.68s)]
*  Because after the Daily Mail published their story, the photographer admitted to mislabeling [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=351.68s)]
*  the date. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=358.0s)]
*  Quote, An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Gavin Newsom's wife was shopping [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=359.0s)]
*  in Beverly Hills on Monday. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=365.4s)]
*  The photographs were actually taken in January. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  And a shout out to Gavin Newsom's whole digital response team, communications team, all the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=371.84s)]
*  way up to Governor Gavin Newsom for hitting back hard. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=377.28s)]
*  Governor Newsom posts the following, California's firefighting resources are already seeing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=381.44s)]
*  cuts by the U.S. Forest Service. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  And now Trump's illegal military deployment threatens them even further. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  That's why I'm launching a new CAL FIRE recruitment drive to ramp up efforts and to keep our [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=393.84s)]
*  community safe. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=399.76s)]

*  You need it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=405.14s)]
*  And it's not something that most guys can fix themselves. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=406.14s)]
*  And men should think the exact same way about ED. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=409.02s)]
*  But the reality is you might be hesitant to seek help. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJl9rVr_fKw&t=413.0s)]
