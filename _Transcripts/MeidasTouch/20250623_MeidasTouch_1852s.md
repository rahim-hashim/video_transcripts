# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE in Middle East as Iran RETALIATES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA)
*  This is a breaking news alert as all hell continues to break loose in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran is officially retaliating. They've launched medium-range ballistic missiles at a United [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=5.36s)]
*  States Air Force base in Qatar. Several US defense officials have confirmed that US forces at the Al [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Udeid Air Base in Qatar were attacked earlier with short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=22.48s)]
*  fired from Iran. No reports so far of any casualties to US service members stationed in Qatar or [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=29.44s)]
*  the Middle East. Kuwait, Iraq have joined also Bahrain and the UAE and Qatar in now closing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=36.88s)]
*  their airspace following the Iranian ballistic missile attack against the US air base in Qatar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=46.0s)]
*  The White House is saying that Trump is monitoring the situation. Iran is calling this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  Operation Glad Tidings of Victory, again targeting US forces, and at this stage [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  we're getting footage like this. Panic seen in Doha during the Iranian ballistic missile attack [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  earlier against the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. You can play this footage right here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  Here we see the sirens sounding earlier in Bahrain as residents were told to take shelter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=84.08s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=90.48s)]
*  This is footage showing surface-to-air missiles launched from the Al Udeid Air Base intercepting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=102.0s)]
*  the Iranian ballistic missiles earlier over Doha, Qatar. You can see that. Play this clip. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=109.76s)]
*  Right now Trump is currently in the situation room. US jets are scrambling over Saudi Arabia [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=129.76s)]
*  right now. The New York Times is reporting that Iran allegedly coordinated the attacks on the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=137.2s)]
*  American air base with Qatar and Qatari officials and gave advance notice that the attacks were [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=143.04s)]
*  coming to minimize casualties, according to three Iranian officials familiar with the plans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  The officials said Iran symbolically needed to strike back at the US, but at the same time [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=155.12s)]
*  carry it out in a way that allowed all sides an exit ramp. They described it similar to the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  strategy to 2020 when Iran gave Iraq a heads up before firing ballistic missiles, an American base [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=166.0s)]
*  in Iraq following the assassination of its top general. The latest we have is Trump monitoring [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=173.68s)]
*  imminent threats against multiple US bases in the Middle East now, potential Iranian retaliation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=179.2s)]
*  against other bases as well. We will keep you posted there as we learn more. I had the opportunity [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=186.72s)]
*  to interview Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and also the Democratic ranking member of the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=195.12s)]
*  House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Congress member Himes, the two top Democrats in this area. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=204.0s)]
*  I interviewed them right before the retaliatory strikes. I want to play for you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Democratic leader Jeffries who talks about how Donald Trump's declaration of war powers [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=221.28s)]
*  is unconstitutional, a violation of the Constitution. Democratic leader Jeffries [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=227.28s)]
*  didn't mince words when I interviewed him. And then Democratic ranking member Himes of the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=233.84s)]
*  Intelligence Committee and the news was breaking as I was interviewing him. Let me bring you both [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=239.04s)]
*  of these interviews together now. Let's play them. I'm joined by Democratic leader Hakeem [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Jeffries. I want to get your reaction to the strikes by the United States of Iran, the fallout, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=250.08s)]
*  the fact that Trump did not seek congressional authorization and didn't seem to even give [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=256.24s)]
*  any notification to at least Democrats. What's your response to everything that just happened? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=262.24s)]
*  The Constitution is very clear on this issue that only Congress has the power to declare war and to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=266.64s)]
*  authorize the type of offensive military action that Donald Trump deployed in striking Iran. Now, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=273.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to have to demonstrate to the American people and to us in Congress that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  there was an imminent threat that justified his actions. It's hard to imagine that he has the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  ability to actually prove that because we've seen no evidence to justify this type of offensive [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=294.48s)]
*  strike. And the problem with it is that there doesn't also seem to be a plan for how to avoid [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=302.64s)]
*  the type of escalation that could result in America being dragged into another potentially [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=310.32s)]
*  disastrous Middle Eastern war, which the overwhelming majority of the American people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=318.08s)]
*  want no part of at this moment. It seemed that less than 90 days ago, Donald Trump's director [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=323.2s)]
*  of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified under oath that there was not an imminent threat [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=329.44s)]
*  of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Then all of a sudden it seemed like in the past two weeks, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  behind the scenes, we would get drips of things happening. Things started escalating very, very [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  quickly. And then all of a sudden these strikes happened. There wasn't even any communication at [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=347.2s)]
*  all with the American people of what was happening. We get Trump's social media posts online [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=353.04s)]
*  including this morning that looks like the rantings and ravings of a lunatic with exclamation [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=359.36s)]
*  points. We'll talk about the one from this morning, but it's unclear what the hell is even happening. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's what American, what the hell is happening is a common thing I'm hearing from our [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=370.32s)]
*  audience. The reason that the constitution and the wisdom of the framers gives Congress exclusively [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=374.72s)]
*  the power to declare war and authorize military force is so that there can actually be an informed [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=382.4s)]
*  debate in public that allows the American people through their elected representatives in the House [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=389.76s)]
*  and in the Senate to make a decision about what is right for the country, what's in our best interest, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=397.28s)]
*  what's in our national security interest. And so the failure to have that happen is a high bar [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=403.84s)]
*  that Donald Trump needs to cross in order to demonstrate that aggressive diplomacy, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=411.2s)]
*  which I called for, wasn't the right way to go. And what was strange about it all is that on Friday [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=416.8s)]
*  he indicated that we're going to allow for two weeks to take place so that we can see if we can [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=424.32s)]
*  arrive at an agreement related to stopping Iran from becoming nuclear capable, which is a goal [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  that we all share. Iran is a sworn enemy of the United States of America. We cannot allow them [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=439.92s)]
*  to become a nuclear power. The question, of course, is what is the best way to do that? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=445.12s)]
*  And the moment seemed to call for aggressive diplomacy, not a strike that was not authorized [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  by the United States Congress. Then a week before Trump said that, there was supposed to be, I think, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=456.8s)]
*  the sixth round of discussions with Iran on the prior Sunday. And then Israel struck, I think, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=462.96s)]
*  two or three days before there was supposed to be the sixth round. And then the Trump regime was [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=470.08s)]
*  basically saying, oh, that was all part of our decoy. We said we were doing a sixth round of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=475.12s)]
*  discussion, but trickdia. And we did this because nothing's making sense. Have you been briefed? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=479.84s)]
*  Have Democrats been briefed? Is Congress been briefed? Is there going to be a briefing? What's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  going on? So we'll have an all-member briefing that takes place for the House of Representatives [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=491.92s)]
*  tomorrow. I spoke to the White House on Saturday, and I asked them for a leadership briefing, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=497.92s)]
*  which has yet to be forthcoming. And if you have evidence that justifies a strike because of an [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  alleged imminent threat of Iran becoming nuclear capable, all of a sudden present that evidence. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=512.72s)]
*  And in the absence of doing that, you're hiding from congressional leadership on the Democratic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=520.64s)]
*  side, and you're hiding, by extension, from the American people. So tomorrow, at that all-member [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=525.6s)]
*  classified briefing, I expect that on the Democratic side, at least, and perhaps a handful [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=532.0s)]
*  of Republicans, are going to highly scrutinize the Trump administration, both as it relates to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=538.08s)]
*  the justification for this strike without following the constitutional process, and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=545.2800000000001s)]
*  the boastful claims that Donald Trump has made that the Iranian nuclear program has been completely [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  and totally obliterated. We've also seen no evidence to suggest that that, in fact, was the case, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=558.96s)]
*  notwithstanding the bravery of the men and women in the armed services who carried out the strike. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  We continue to pray for them and for their safety. But this is about the Trump administration and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=571.04s)]
*  the constitutional process that's in place, the law that is required in order to authorize military [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=578.0s)]
*  force that they have not adhered to, as far as we can tell at this moment, and questioning the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=585.52s)]
*  aftermath of the strike in terms of, was it even successful, and what's their plan to avoid entering [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=592.4s)]
*  into another potentially disastrous Middle Eastern war? How unusual is it that there would not be a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=599.92s)]
*  gang of eight brief or a leadership brief at this stage, and that it's the very first time that you [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=606.56s)]
*  or other leaders of the House Intelligence Committee are going to find out anything about what happened [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  would be a few days after the strike took place? How unusual is that? It's highly unusual that there [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=620.56s)]
*  wasn't a briefing in advance of any potential military action being contemplated by the Trump [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=626.4s)]
*  administration. Then he strikes Iran without congressional authorization, and then days have [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=633.52s)]
*  gone by without even a gang of eight briefing, which of course represents the top four legislative [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=641.12s)]
*  leaders in the Congress and the top four leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=648.0s)]
*  I mean, this is extraordinary, and I explicitly asked on Saturday at the highest levels of the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=654.0s)]
*  White House for a gang of eight briefing, and they have failed to produce it. What are they trying to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=660.24s)]
*  hide from the American people by hiding from the legislative leaders in the House and in the Senate? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=668.48s)]
*  Well, this is going on too. You have the disastrous budget bill working its way now [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=675.6s)]
*  through the Senate. They're making it, this was even possible worse than what it looked like in [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=679.92s)]
*  the House. More cuts to Medicaid, more issues that are going to cause massive amounts of money, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=686.0s)]
*  trillions added to the debt. What do you want the American people to know about that? Because [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=693.76s)]
*  it seems like kind of whack-a-mole here, but we have to focus on all of this that's going down. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=699.12s)]
*  Yeah, the one big ugly bill, this GOP tax scam, represents the largest cut to Medicaid in American [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=705.84s)]
*  history. Children and families and people with disabilities and seniors and everyday Americans [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  are going to be hurt. Hospitals will close, nursing homes will shut down. People are not going to be [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=719.52s)]
*  able to get the care that they need in community after community all across the country, including [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  in rural America. And as a result of that, people will die. At the same time, the Republicans in this [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=732.4s)]
*  one big ugly bill are trying to enact the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=739.76s)]
*  They are literally ripping food out of the mouths of children, veterans, seniors, small business owners, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=748.0s)]
*  and others in order to provide their billionaire donors with massive tax breaks. And they want [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=755.52s)]
*  to stick all of us with the bill by exploding the debt by more than three trillion dollars. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=762.32s)]
*  This GOP tax scam hurts everyday Americans in order to reward billionaires. That's why we're [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=768.48s)]
*  doing everything we can to stop it, stop it in the Senate. It limped out of the House by barely a vote. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=774.96s)]
*  It may come back to the House of Representatives, and we're going to do everything that we can to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  shut it down when it comes back to us, if it even makes it out of the United States Senate. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  Finally, I think you've seen the energy on the ground with those no-kings protests, millions of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=791.92s)]
*  Americans peacefully protesting across the country, red states, blue states, purple states, big cities, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  small cities, towns of all sizes, what Americans see as an authoritarian regime that is constantly [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=802.16s)]
*  violating the law. And we see an example of it here, just going to war without providing any [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=809.52s)]
*  information, without seeking authorization. So when we say it's unconstitutional, when we say [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=815.6s)]
*  that he's violating the law over and over again, what else can be done? I mean, I think you see [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  people taken to the streets peacefully, but what else can be done to stop this unconstitutional [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=828.88s)]
*  encroachment? Frankly, what many people, and I believe is actually a dictatorship here in the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=835.12s)]
*  United States, as we see our brothers and sisters being disappeared by ICE agents, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=840.88s)]
*  or people who are being deputized as ICE agents terrorizing our streets, what do we do? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=846.88s)]
*  Well, the peaceful protests that have taken place, millions and millions of people coming out to the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=852.4s)]
*  streets peacefully demonstrating, pushing back against the tyrannical government that they're [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=858.24s)]
*  seeing this flood of extremism that has been unleashed on the American people is incredibly [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=863.92s)]
*  important. It's an all hands on deck moment in terms of aggressively pushing back in the Congress, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=868.56s)]
*  which we'll continue to do, aggressively pushing back in the courts, which we'll continue to do, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=876.16s)]
*  but perhaps most importantly, aggressively pushing back in community after community [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  after community all throughout the country to win the hearts and minds of the American people [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  as is being done. You know, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday next year, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=892.88s)]
*  and when this democracy thing got started, it was once said that if the people fear the government, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=900.4799999999999s)]
*  there is tyranny, but when the government fears the people, there is liberty, and if we want to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  get back to a place where there's liberty and justice for all in the United States of America, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=918.32s)]
*  it's going to be important for us to continue to peacefully show up, stand up, speak up [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=925.2s)]
*  for what is right, make sure we do what is necessary, of course, to win elections all [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  across the country, including perhaps most importantly, taking back control of the House [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=938.08s)]
*  of Representatives so we can cut Donald Trump's presidency in half legislatively, and together, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=942.72s)]
*  I'm confident that if we continue to do the things that have been done and we are in a more is more [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=950.48s)]
*  environment, so we have to continue to do more, all of us, that we will one day soon end this [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=955.28s)]
*  national nightmare and get our great country back on track. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  thanks for joining us. Thank you, man. That was the interview with Democratic leader Jeffries. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=968.08s)]
*  Now let me play you the interview of a Democratic ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=973.12s)]
*  Congressmember Himes. Let's play. I'm joined by Democratic Congressmember, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=978.96s)]
*  Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressmember, I just got to show you [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=982.4000000000001s)]
*  what Donald Trump posted just moments ago and get your reaction to it as the ranking member of the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=987.76s)]
*  House of Diligence Committee. Here's what he's posting. I think he coined the term panicking. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=992.48s)]
*  He said, don't be a panicking, but he seems to be a panicking right now. Everyone keep oil prices [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=997.12s)]
*  down. I'm watching! Exclamation point. You're playing right into the hands of the enemy. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  Don't do it. All in caps. And then he posts to the Department of Energy, drill, baby, drill. And some [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1008.96s)]
*  of those words are in caps. And I mean now, I mean, does he actually think that they do the drilling [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1015.84s)]
*  at the Department of Energy? And then he says this message to Russia's former president, Medvedev, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1021.04s)]
*  did I hear that former president Medvedev from Russia casually throwing around the N word, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1026.48s)]
*  nuclear, and saying that he and other countries would supply nuclear warheads to Iran? Did he [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1031.76s)]
*  really say that? Or is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that, if he did confirm, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1036.56s)]
*  let me know immediately. The N word should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1042.88s)]
*  the boss. By the way, if anyone thinks our hardware was great over the weekend, far and away, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1048.32s)]
*  the strongest and best equipped we have, 20 years advanced over the pack is our nuclear submarines. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1052.88s)]
*  They are the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built. And they just launched the 30 Tomahawks. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1060.0s)]
*  Congress member Himes, you know, as, who was it that once said, walk softly and carry a big stick? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1066.64s)]
*  And I think that policy was probably the right way. What in the world is this? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1073.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Look, I think this is his advisors telling him, well, you know, oil prices could go [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1078.0s)]
*  up if the, you know, Iranians decide to cut the Straits of Hormuz, which is where 20% of global oil [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1085.04s)]
*  comes through. You know, I think that's probably what's going on. And by the way, I can confirm [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1092.48s)]
*  for him, not that I, not that he listens to me, but I can confirm for him that Medvedev put up some [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1097.84s)]
*  sort of social media posts so I can at least get that done for him today. Medvedev did in fact say [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1103.04s)]
*  that he may, you know, Russia may provide nukes, but, you know, I don't believe that that's going [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1109.36s)]
*  to happen. I don't believe that individually we've got the ability to keep oil prices down. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1115.04s)]
*  And I also don't believe that the Department of Energy has anything to do with oil drilling. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1119.76s)]
*  Now that said, what's really going on here, of course, is, you know, maybe the man's a little [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1123.92s)]
*  nervous because he's gotten himself and us into a massive, massive gamble that involves gasoline [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1128.64s)]
*  prices and nuclear weapons and all sorts of serious things. But, you know, look, it's the classic Trump [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1135.2800000000002s)]
*  thing, right? It's the game of chicken. Or I think this goes back to the Nixon administration, you know, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1140.88s)]
*  what if you're the craziest guy in the room? If you're the craziest guy in the room and you've [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1146.5600000000002s)]
*  got nuclear weapons and don't really understand what's going on, which is certainly all of those [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1150.96s)]
*  posts suggest to be true, people are likely to give you a wide berth and a big margin. So I think [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1155.2s)]
*  that's what's going on. Well, I think that worked with Kim Jong-un. We see how powerful they are in [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1161.68s)]
*  North Korea. I'm being sarcastic. I mean, the thing of the Treasury Secretary Scott Besson [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1166.0s)]
*  in Donald Trump's trade policies referred to it as the crazy eye than theory. He, you know, he goes, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1171.3600000000001s)]
*  he's crazy. We just that that's that's the unifying principle right now in American foreign policy and [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1176.48s)]
*  trade policy is that we're the craziest and you don't know what we're going to do. You're going to [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1183.44s)]
*  wake up. Is he going to start posting N word nuclear bomb crazy guy or is he going to go golfing? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1188.16s)]
*  What's going to happen? But we're the United States of America. Damn it. Don't we go through [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1194.64s)]
*  deliberative process and Congress is supposed to be the ones who authorize war and they talk about [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1198.56s)]
*  these things. So we know we have good intelligence. We don't have a director of national intelligence [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  show up 90 days ago and say, no, no, we don't see a major threat right there anytime soon. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1211.04s)]
*  And then have the president go, yeah, don't believe her. She doesn't know what she's talking about. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  That kind of I don't like crazy congressman. Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough. You know, I'm quite sure [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1220.0s)]
*  the Canadian people would be very happy to receive you into the warm embrace of their citizenship. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1227.36s)]
*  If you're not going to make it this next three years of crazy. But yeah, look, I, you know, I [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  also think I've been thinking a lot about this, you know, I think that there is not likely to be [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1238.88s)]
*  a lot of really good news here. What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is that, you know, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1245.5200000000002s)]
*  we don't even know if the uranium was in Fordo or Natanz or Esfahan. You know, it's quite possible [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1249.5200000000002s)]
*  since this was an advertised raid that the Iranians loaded that stuff up into a truck or a bunch of [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  trucks, I should say, and moved it. Now, maybe we'll figure that out. But I think there's one [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1261.68s)]
*  thing that would be a good and visible outcome here. And that's what the president was contradicting [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1267.52s)]
*  all of his people on yesterday, which is regime change. Look, if the Iranian people finally find [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1273.36s)]
*  a way to get rid of these evil sob's under whom they have labored so brutally for decades now, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1277.92s)]
*  that would be a very visible sign of success. But, you know, I really worry about this because [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1286.32s)]
*  you know what appears to be a sign of success, which is that the regime doesn't attack our [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1293.12s)]
*  military around the world. But what if the uranium is in a warehouse somewhere right now, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1298.0s)]
*  and the Iranians are working like crazy North Korea style to actually create a weapon? We might [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1304.3999999999999s)]
*  not know about that. So I think it's dawning on the president that he had successful military raids [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1310.2399999999998s)]
*  in the sense that we shook a lot of facilities, broke a lot of stuff and got our pilots and naval [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1316.3999999999999s)]
*  assets out of the way quickly. But I don't see that there short of regime change going to be [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1323.12s)]
*  obvious good news coming out of this. And I think I think that's beginning to dawn on the president. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  And when they talk about, you know, regime change, you know, I have to imagine though, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1336.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, number one regime change also can mean civil war can mean boots on the ground can be [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1341.84s)]
*  mean a broader regional conflict. And I may be naive here, but I don't think that the Iranian [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  people are going to warmly welcome a Benjamin Netanyahu proxy leading Iran or a Donald Trump [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  pick, you know, and I wonder, I worry that it pushes them in another direction than where they [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1362.64s)]
*  were heading when you saw protests on the street in Tehran that they were clamping down on. If you [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  if you know if regime change is coming from Netanyahu and Trump, but what are your thoughts? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1377.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, look, I mean, you know, all we have is history to go on. And we engineered three [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1382.56s)]
*  regime changes in the region over the course of the last 20 years, right? Maam or Gaddafi in Libya, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  we had a lot to do with that. We destroyed the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. And of course, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  Iraq right now, Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq. Did any of those go our way? No, they did not. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1399.84s)]
*  Regime change in Iraq led to a brutal war that killed 4400 Americans. It empowered Iran. Libya [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1405.6s)]
*  is a hellscape right now chaotic. And Afghanistan is right back under the direction and lead of the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1412.8s)]
*  of the Taliban. Now, there are differences to be fair here, right? You know, Iran is a nation of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  90 million people note that Senator Cruz, that is actually, you know, commercially, it's not [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1424.7199999999998s)]
*  Afghanistan, you've got educated people, you know, these people can't stand their own regime. So I'm [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1430.3999999999999s)]
*  not going to say that it's impossible. I'm just gonna say that the historical record is not a [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1434.96s)]
*  happy one. You know, as long as we're on the topic, you know, we haven't talked about it yet. But [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1438.8s)]
*  this is precisely the kind of action that Congress should have been consulted on. There's not a lot of [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1445.52s)]
*  ambiguity in the War Powers Act, or Powers Act says the president go to war if there is an imminent [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1453.44s)]
*  and immediate attack on the United States, or if there's been a declaration of war, congressional [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1458.4s)]
*  approval. Now, there's a lot of what about us out there right now saying, Oh, well, Biden did it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1462.4s)]
*  And Bill Clinton sent, you know, tomahawks into Somalia and stuff. And yes, yes, presidents have [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1467.0400000000002s)]
*  consistently abrogated congressional power. But here's the difference, right? When President [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  Clinton sent a bunch of missiles into Somalia, or when Joe Biden put troops on the ground in Syria, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1477.2800000000002s)]
*  we weren't playing with we were playing a nuclear game the way we're playing right now, we didn't [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  have 40,000 troops that were very much under the guns of the people that we were going after. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1492.0s)]
*  And so the Constitution would say you always do this. And I get it, presidents haven't always [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1497.84s)]
*  done it. But you're sure as hell do it when the stakes are as high as they are in this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1502.08s)]
*  Israeli and subsequent US strike on Iran. And you know, that that was the intention of the founding [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1508.32s)]
*  the founders in the Constitution. And we got to not forget that if there's 40,000 people at risk, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1514.72s)]
*  the people who represent those 40,000 people and their families get to have a conversation about [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1521.44s)]
*  whether this is a good idea. Breaking news, we're learning from Axios and other reporting [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1526.3200000000002s)]
*  that it does appear Iran is now launching missiles at United States assets in the Middle East. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1531.44s)]
*  Axios is reporting right now that Israel detected the launch of at least six ballistic missiles by [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1536.56s)]
*  Iran against Qatar. Explosions are currently being heard over Doha in Qatar. There's also now reports [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1542.72s)]
*  of missile launches now against United States bases in Iraq as we've been recording this. Now, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1550.24s)]
*  I'm obviously just getting this information. I need to go and further verify it. But some credible [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1556.4s)]
*  sources are reporting it. I'll start with the caveat of if that is true, what's your reaction? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1561.2s)]
*  Well, it's a that's a very it's not surprising. But it's pretty scary, right. And it's pretty [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1568.56s)]
*  scary in the sense that we can defend those bases. And I'm thinking of the naval base at Bahrain. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1576.8s)]
*  I'm thinking of the air base that we have in Qatar and obviously other deployed troops around the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1582.8s)]
*  region. The Iranians have the ability to do a lot of harm. We're pretty good at defending those [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1588.24s)]
*  bases and those assets, but they could, you know, I pray God this doesn't happen. But if the reports [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1594.8s)]
*  are correct, you know, we may close out the day to day with American casualties, which again, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1600.8s)]
*  I'm not sure anybody would have supported or at least should have been taken into account by [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1607.2s)]
*  congressional debate and congressional approval of this strike. And look, it's fairly obvious to [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1614.0s)]
*  say that if there are American casualties, there will be a response to that. And now we are in a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1621.68s)]
*  war. I mean, you saw the president, the president was doing everything he could to say this is a [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1627.12s)]
*  one off, we're just going to destroy a whole bunch of your stuff. But that's it. That's it. Don't [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  worry about it. That's not the way the world works. Right. The Iranian regime has their own politics. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1635.6s)]
*  And you know, they're already looking humiliated and weak. And if they do nothing, they do nothing, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  I suspect they fear for their own survival. So anyway, if those reports are true, let's just, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1645.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, pray that Americans there stay safe. I think it was General Mattis who said, you know, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1652.08s)]
*  the other side in a war also gets a vote. And that's one of the problems in war. I want to get [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  just your final thoughts about, you know, everything right now. I mean, your message to the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1665.52s)]
*  American people. I mean, you're the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee for everyone. What [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1669.76s)]
*  that means is you're the top guy, the top person on the Intelligence Committee that's usually [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1674.24s)]
*  supposed to be consulted on things like this. You're supposed to be intimately involved in [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1679.76s)]
*  this process. You have a wealth of experience to come to bear to be helpful, usually to be working [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1685.2s)]
*  with the director of national intelligence and people like Hegseth and others and in normal, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1691.6s)]
*  in normal times collaboratively that didn't happen here. What's your overall message? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1697.12s)]
*  Yeah, look, my overall message is we shouldn't be in this place. We should not have taken an [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1703.2s)]
*  act of this consequence without somebody other than the guy in the Oval Office deliberating. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1708.56s)]
*  There's way too much at stake. There's 40,000 troops. There's the survival of allied regimes [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1714.48s)]
*  like Jordan, right? You know, I keep pointing out that the King of Jordan sits in a very precarious [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1720.24s)]
*  throne, right? Because the Jordanian street is not one bit happy that the Israelis and the Americans [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1725.6799999999998s)]
*  are attacking Iran. There's our military assets there. Again, if the Straits of Hormuz close, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1731.04s)]
*  you know, stand by for a major spike in the price of gasoline. And it's fascinating from [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1737.7600000000002s)]
*  a political standpoint, if I may just take this detour for one second, you know, here's a [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1742.88s)]
*  president who won elections saying you're paying too much for stuff. And I think these, you know, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1746.96s)]
*  whatever we are here, 120, 140 days are all about stuff that is going to make Americans' [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1752.16s)]
*  prices higher, including gasoline, by the way, if this thing goes south as it appears to be doing. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1759.1200000000001s)]
*  And so look, what can we do right now? We can just hope that sanity prevails. The [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1763.36s)]
*  truth socials and tweets that you posted don't give me a lot of confidence that sanity is going [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1770.0s)]
*  to prevail, but the stakes are way too high right now. We have to go back to the one thing, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1774.4799999999998s)]
*  the one thing, the one thing that has actually proven effective at stopping the Iranians from [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1779.84s)]
*  getting a nuclear weapon, and that is a negotiated solution. The JCPOA, which was controversial, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1784.7199999999998s)]
*  was the one thing that caused the Iranians to ship their uranium out of the country and to stop [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1790.08s)]
*  their progress. Now the prime minister of Israel and the president of the United States decided [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1795.52s)]
*  they would try something else. But, you know, if this starts getting as ugly as it could get, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1799.52s)]
*  we better get back to that diplomacy, which is the one thing that has been shown to actually [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1805.6s)]
*  slow the role of the Iranians in their development of a nuclear program. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1810.72s)]
*  Congress member Jim Himes, thanks for joining us. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NLUO4llEA&t=1814.8s)]
