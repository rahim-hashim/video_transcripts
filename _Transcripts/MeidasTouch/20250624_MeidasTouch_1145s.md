# Trump has DISASTER PRESSER over WAR and LOSES IT on TV
**MeidasTouch:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY)
*  Donald Trump is having a complete and total meltdown this morning. He's ranting and raving and cursing in front of cameras. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's upset that Israel and Iran were not listening to his social media posts where he said that there was a ceasefire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=6.16s)]
*  And so he got in front of the cameras right before he took off to fly to Europe, where he's going to be in the Netherlands at The Hague for a NATO summit meeting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=14.0s)]
*  And he started just dropping F-bombs and started cursing. Here, watch this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=21.84s)]
*  ...about that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=26.4s)]
*  You know what? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=29.28s)]
*  You have to reply to Iran? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=38.32s)]
*  Then he goes on to whine about Israel and says, why did they unload? Why did they have to unload more after the ceasefire against Iran? Here, play this clip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so, but I'm not happy that Israel is going out now. There was one rocket that I guess was fired overboard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=56.8s)]
*  It was after the time limit and it missed its target. And now Israel is going out. These guys got to calm down. Ridiculous. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=63.52s)]
*  I didn't like plenty of things I saw yesterday. I didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=74.8s)]
*  They didn't have to unload. And I didn't like the fact that the retaliation was very strong. But in all fairness, Israel unloaded a lot. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=80.96s)]
*  And now I hear Israel just went out because they felt it was violated by one rocket that didn't land anywhere. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=89.92s)]
*  That's not what we want, I'll tell you. And I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that Israel either. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=96.72s)]
*  Then he starts name calling CNN and MSNBC because they're accurately reporting that Iran most likely still has uranium, that the nuclear facilities were not fully destroyed, and that Iran is no longer going to be having any communications or meaningful coordination with the IAEA. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  What do you think of Iran's decision to completely demolish it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=122.56s)]
*  The networks aren't much better. It's all fake news, but they should not have done that. Those pilots hit their targets, those targets were obliterated, and the pilots should be given credit. They're not after the pilots, they're after me. They want to try and demean. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=152.56s)]
*  And again, it's just more whining from him. He goes, I really think that MSNBC needs to apologize. They were being mean to me. Did everybody see what a great job I did? They were being mean to me. Here, play this clip. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=168.4s)]
*  The place is demolished. The B-2 pilots did their job. They did it better than anybody could even imagine. They hit late in the evening. It was dark with no moon, and they hit that target with every one of those things, and that place is gone. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=182.56s)]
*  But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought. It was demolished. You take a look at the pinpricks, and you see that place is gone. And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. I think that MSNBC ought to apologize. I think these guys, really, these networks and these cable networks are real losers. You really are. You're real losers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=196.4s)]
*  It's real sad that they violated the security rules. You're gutless losers. I say that to CNN because I watch it. I have no choice. I've got to watch it garbage. It's all garbage. It's all fake news. But I think CNN is a gutless group of people, and the people that run it, nobody even knows it's been sold so many times. But the people that run it ought to be ashamed. MSNBC, a guy named Brian Roberts, he heads it. He's a disgrace. He's a weak, pathetic disgrace. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=226.4s)]
*  Now, at the same time, Donald Trump was whining, ranting, and raving like a lunatic, cursing on camera. Very presidential behavior, huh? Just cursing in front of the world. So ridiculous. Like, the worst role model ever. But he's a felon. He's a sexual abuser. He's a bankruptor. He's a fraud. He's a crook. He's a criminal. At the same time, Donald Trump was behaving consistent with what I just said. You had Magomag, John McDonough, and you had the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=253.28s)]
*  speaker of the House. And he says we're under no illusions that you can just kill all their nuclear ambitions overnight. But isn't that what Donald Trump said that he was able to do? Did you not get your talking points there right, Magomag Johnson? Here, play this clip. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=278.12s)]
*  After we crash them. Right now, Mr. Speaker, Reuters is reporting Iran's nuclear chief says we're going to immediately start reconstituting our nuclear program. I mean, are you kidding me? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=299.92s)]
*  It's madness. I mean, we're under no illusion that you can just kill all their nuclear ambition overnight. But I think reality has set in over there. We have decimated the upper echelon of their military command as well as their nuclear scientists. I mean, there's not much left for them to rebuild upon. But the idea that they would put out a statement like that at this fragile moment is very frustrating. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=314.6s)]
*  Now, the New York Times, Midas Touch and others are reporting the following. Officials concede that they don't know the fate of Iran's uranium stockpile. Both Vice President J.D. Vance and Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, acknowledged questions about the whereabouts of Iran's stockpile of near bomb grade nuclear material. There was also evidence, according to two Israeli officials with knowledge of the intelligence, that Iran had moved equipment and uranium from the site. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=338.04s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program has been in operation for more than a decade and there was growing evidence that the Iranians attuned to Mr. Trump's repeated threats to take military action had removed 400 kilograms or roughly 880 pounds of uranium enriched to 60% purity. That is just below the 90% that is usually used in nuclear weapons. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=368.0s)]
*  Iran has approved a plan to end all cooperation with the IAEA, setting the Iranian nuclear program up to operate with zero international observation. So you would expect that that would make Donald Trump mad considering that none of his objectives were met and you heard him curse there before. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=390.96s)]
*  But then Donald Trump took to social media to praise China and to praise Iran and to encourage Iran to sell oil to China very cheaply. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=410.92s)]
*  Donald Trump posts, China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. Hopefully they will purchase plenty from the US also. It is my great honor to make this happen! [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=423.88s)]
*  It is your great honor as the United States President to help China get cheap oil from Iran while not denuclearizing Iran. And now Iran is totally withdrawing from any cooperation from the IAEA. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=437.84s)]
*  Who would benefit from a robust and powerful Iran? Maybe Vladimir Putin who gets all of his Shahid drones sent from Iran. Maybe Donald Trump is actually helping the alliance between Iran, Russia, China, North Korea as he goes and heads to The Hague in the Netherlands where he is bashing NATO. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  Maybe that is who actually benefits from this. So now the MAGA is on Capitol Hill. They are worried because they think, whoa, it seems that Iran still has some of its nuclear material. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=479.76s)]
*  So here is MAGA Republican Congress member Perry and he says, Iran is still a terror regime with enriched uranium. So what are you all celebrating? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=491.76s)]
*  Oh, you are celebrating the photo op of Donald Trump, your dear later Kim Jong-un dictator, because you think that photo op makes him look powerful. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  That is what this was all about. A photo op to distract from the No King's protest. Trump not releasing the Epstein files. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=514.72s)]
*  The disastrous budget bill being wildly unpopular in the United States and Donald Trump being the most disapproved of president in the history of the United States at this time. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  But here is Scott Perry. Let's play that clip. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  I suspect that it's hard to say, but I wouldn't, we'll put it this way. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it still exists. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  They absolutely are. They have never changed since the day the Ayatollah took over and they threaten their neighbors, not only in the region, but around the world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  That has been their history. That's who they are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  That is absolutely true. I would, I would, I would. Yeah, I think that's a correct characterization. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  No, of course it's not good. But again, the goal for the United States of America is to make sure that they can't do anything with that enriched uranium. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  How much time, money and energy have you spent on health, wellness and beauty products to look and feel younger and healthier? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  If you're like me, probably too much. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  Now I'm so excited to share with you guys C15 from Fatty15, the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=609.64s)]
*  Now it's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health and wellness and you guessed it, healthy aging. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=617.64s)]
*  Fatty15 co-founder Dr. Stephanie Van Watson, she discovered the benefits of C15 while working with the U.S. Navy to continually improve the health and welfare of aging dolphins. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=625.64s)]
*  Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key to healthy aging nutrient, which helps to slow biological aging at the cellular level. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=638.6s)]
*  Now, in fact, when our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile and age faster. And when our cells age, our bodies age too. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=648.6s)]
*  So Fatty15 is a science-backed, award-winning, patented 100% pure C15 supplement. It's vegan-friendly, free of flavors, allergens or preservatives. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3s or fish oil. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  I love Fatty15. I've personally seen the benefits. Definitely check this stuff out. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  Best of all, Fatty15 comes in a gorgeous reusable glass bamboo jar and refills are shipped right to your door. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=680.52s)]
*  Now Fatty15 is on a mission to optimize your C15 levels to help support your long-term health and wellness, especially as you age. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=688.52s)]
*  You can get an additional 15% off their 90-day subscription starter kit by going to fatty15.com slash mitis and using code MITIS at checkout. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=697.48s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts, heading to NATO where at worst it will be a much calmer period than what I just went through with Israel and Iran. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=711.48s)]
*  I look forward to seeing all of my very good European friends and others. Hopefully much will be accomplished. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=719.48s)]
*  The Europeans are only having one session with Donald Trump involving the dues for NATO to pay, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=726.44s)]
*  but all the other working sessions at this point they feel like why in the world would we want Donald Trump there? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=734.44s)]
*  At least that's what Fox and Jesse Waters was reporting last night. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=739.44s)]
*  You have Donald Trump making posts like this, attacking MAGA Republican Congressmember Thomas Massey. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=744.44s)]
*  He goes, third-rate Congressman Thomas Massey of the great Commonwealth of Kentucky, a phenomenal state that I won three times, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=751.4000000000001s)]
*  keeps talking about how he's going to protect the Constitution, but he is very bad for the Constitution, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  and will probably vote against the great big beautiful bill that grants the biggest tax cuts in history, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=763.4000000000001s)]
*  secures our southern border from criminal invasion, funds the Golden Dome, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=769.4000000000001s)]
*  our great military and veterans, protects our Second Amendment, grants no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=774.36s)]
*  and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, blah blah blah blah blah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=780.36s)]
*  And he goes and tells people to primary Massey, let's be very clear, there's nothing in this budget bill about no tax on Social Security. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=784.36s)]
*  With respect to no tax on tips and no tax on overtime, they are so severely narrowed in definition [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=792.36s)]
*  as to not even be meaningful at all in terms of the deductions people are going to get. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=801.32s)]
*  And when 15 million people are ripped off of their health care, and given Donald Trump's tariff policy causing an increase in inflation, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=805.32s)]
*  given unemployment growing, it's going to be not helpful at all to service workers. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=815.32s)]
*  Donald Trump then attacks the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=823.32s)]
*  Trump writes, too late, Jerome Powell, this is all this morning by the way, too late, Jerome Powell of the Fed will be in Congress today [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=830.2800000000001s)]
*  in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the rate. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had zero. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  No inflation, great economy. We should be at least two to three points lower. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=844.2800000000001s)]
*  I always just ask you, when you go into stores, do you think that there's no inflation? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=848.2800000000001s)]
*  Do you think prices are cheaper? Is housing magically more affordable? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=855.24s)]
*  Or is once again the criminal, the fraud, the sexual abuser, the bankruptor, once again is he lying? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=859.24s)]
*  Donald Trump then continues to make post after post, now that we have made peace abroad, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=867.24s)]
*  we must finish the job here at home by passing the great big beautiful bill. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=873.24s)]
*  You created a conflict, you did not resolve that conflict, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=880.2s)]
*  and you didn't solve the conflict you claim you were going to solve, which was Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=886.2s)]
*  So what the hell are you even talking about? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=892.2s)]
*  Okay, but now we have to pretend in Donald Trump's fictional world that there's total peace throughout the world, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=894.2s)]
*  the world's totally a peaceful place, everything is great, everyone can afford homes, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=900.2s)]
*  everybody is rich, according to him, gas is $1.98 in his fictitious world, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=907.1600000000001s)]
*  and then Donald Trump says, well, now we got to focus on the big beautiful bill. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=913.1600000000001s)]
*  It will be a historic present for the great people of the United States of America. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=917.1600000000001s)]
*  It will bring a golden age, and he puts that in caps over and over and over again, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  and we know how disastrous this budget bill is going to be. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posts this following long message, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=929.1600000000001s)]
*  like just look at this message and how crazy it just it looks. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=934.12s)]
*  And he spent this time, I guess while he's on the plane headed to The Hague, attacking AOC, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=938.12s)]
*  and he goes, stupid AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=942.12s)]
*  one of the dumbest people in Congress, is now calling for my impeachment. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=948.12s)]
*  Despite the fact that the crooked and corrupt Democrats have already done that twice before, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=952.12s)]
*  the reason for her ratings is all of the victories that the USA has had under the Trump administration. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=956.12s)]
*  The Democrats aren't used to winning, and she can't stand the concept of our country being successful again. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=963.08s)]
*  He just goes on to whine and whine and whine. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=967.08s)]
*  Auto pen, then he says, how dare the mouse tells us how to run the United States of America? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=971.08s)]
*  The mouse? They call her the mouse, the auto pen. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=977.08s)]
*  Then he finishes off by saying, so go ahead, try to impeach me again. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=981.08s)]
*  Make my day! Exclamation point. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=987.08s)]
*  I believe that there should be a basic floor for being the president of the United States. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  I think the basic floor should be you have to actually behave like a grown-up and an adult. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=998.0400000000001s)]
*  If your behavior would get you fired from any corporation in the United States, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1004.0400000000001s)]

*  He's deeply dangerous, he's deeply disturbed, but he's just very ill-equipped to be in any position of leadership at all. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1019.0s)]
*  Then here was the headline from May 29th of 2025. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1029.0s)]
*  Four weeks ago, the US expects more trade deals in the next week or two weeks, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1035.0s)]
*  that now Donald Trump's national economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, is saying trade deals are coming though now, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1041.96s)]
*  but it's once the tax bill passes, so I guess that's two weeks. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1048.96s)]
*  Jake Vig says, it's been so weird to watch a president learn things in real time when fielding a question from the press. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1052.96s)]
*  Then whatever word or concept he learns, he uses in the next few social media posts. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1059.96s)]
*  It's like when a third grader learns a new fact about dinosaurs. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsSbG1GINY&t=1064.96s)]
