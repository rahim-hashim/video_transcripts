# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump TARGETS DEM CITIES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs)
*  I want to take you all to the streets of Chicago to show you what's going on there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's happening also here in Los Angeles and cities across the United States of America. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=4.0s)]
*  Masked ICE agents kind of walking through and chasing people who are not criminals, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=10.16s)]
*  migrants who are vendors, migrants working in restaurants, migrants in Home Depot parking lots. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I just want you to see this image because it is something that should never be normalized. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=25.28s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=30.32s)]
*  You know, and here in Los Angeles, we're seeing the ICE agents and people, I guess, deputized to be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=41.2s)]
*  ICE agents with their masks going through these hardworking Latino communities here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=47.2s)]
*  I also saw the same thing in Chicago in areas where you have Latino communities living. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=53.52s)]
*  I saw this on Telemundo where you saw husbands being separated from their eight-month pregnant [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  wife. Here play this clip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=66.48s)]
*  Then you got people showing up for their court appointments, going through their lawful process, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=82.56s)]
*  showing up where they'll get a message from ICE, hey, you know, if you want to renew your status [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=93.44s)]
*  here, you have to come in. And they go in and then they get arrested and then they get sent to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=99.04s)]
*  expedited deportations. Some of the local Chicago media did a report on this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=105.92s)]
*  Here's the local Fox affiliate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=111.76s)]
*  Ten people were taken by ICE, loaded into a van and driven away under a cloud of confusion and fear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=113.68s)]
*  It's just an attempt to get numbers. Nothing more. A lot of the people here are in asylum [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=121.12s)]
*  proceedings. In recent days, text messages like this one were sent. It reads, in part, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  your ICE officer has asked you to come to the office for a review of your case this week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=132.16s)]
*  So they reported here to the Department of Homeland Security's Intensive Supervision [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=137.44s)]
*  Appearance Program Office near Cermak and Michigan. When they go inside the building, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=143.12s)]
*  automatically they've been arrested. Really, sir? The site is used for case management. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=148.0s)]
*  These are people who came to renew their work permits and were abducted. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=153.52s)]
*  Attorneys like Cynthia Fernandez say they were separated from their clients. Fernandez tells [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=157.12s)]
*  us the woman she represents is a mother of three who believed the check-in would be routine [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=162.88s)]
*  and even brought her Bible. Just hearing them cry, I don't know if it was her, but the women [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=168.72s)]
*  were crying and it's just horrible because I couldn't do anything. As word from attorneys [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=173.44s)]
*  inside reached elected officials, advocates gathered outside. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=178.56s)]
*  In a Gestapo fashion, 50 agents or so walked down the street, stood right here in front of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=185.04s)]
*  driveway, then aggressively came through, knocked me down, assaulted me and other community members [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=191.84s)]
*  here today. A large group tried to stop the van from leaving but was... And then here's what we're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=197.68s)]
*  seeing in Los Angeles. Just, I could show you any city, but here's Los Angeles. Several people were [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=203.28s)]
*  running upwards Wilkins Place. I informed them that ICE agents were around the area. They were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=209.28s)]
*  a row of that and then that's when an SUV pulled up, came out. Two agents tackled down a individual [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=218.4s)]
*  with no questions. They placed his face into the dirt, physically apprehended him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Janulius. Secretary, you see these images. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=235.28s)]
*  You see Donald Trump using the language of authoritarians at war with foreign countries [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  about democratic cities and he's singled out Los Angeles. He's talked about Chicago and he uses [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  war language. I mean, what went through your mind when you saw him at the G7? He's standing there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=258.32s)]
*  next to Prime Minister Carney and he's talking about Chicago and your state of Illinois and other [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=264.4s)]
*  democratic cities as though it were a foreign country that we're about to go to war with. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=271.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, horrifying, sad, depressing, but this is the authoritarianism that we've seen [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=279.12s)]
*  under this administration and I can be sad all day and I can be scared and I could be disappointed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=290.16s)]
*  in what's happening in our country or we could stand up, step up, and really fight back. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=296.72s)]
*  I believe in the promise of America. Both my parents were immigrants who came to this country [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=303.36s)]
*  because they believed in the promise of America and I can't believe we have to have this conversation [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  and these conversations in the year 2025, but we have some fighters here in Chicago and we're going [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=313.6s)]
*  to do everything we can to protect our democracy, to protect this country, and to help fight back [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=320.48s)]
*  against the erosion of our freedoms and fundamental rights. Let's talk about that. You're one of the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=325.52s)]
*  fighters there in the great state of Illinois. One of the things that we have seen ICE using [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=331.84s)]
*  is trying to take advantage of some of those surveillance cameras that capture the license [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=338.88s)]
*  plates and other devices that in the past may have been used for under the pretense of kind of crime [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=344.08s)]
*  prevention or protection or whatever, but they're using it to identify migrants. I know you took [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=353.2s)]
*  some action in the state of Illinois that's relevant here. Yeah, I could not be more proud [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=358.24s)]
*  of the legislation that we passed two years ago. So automatic license plate readers are used to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=363.2s)]
*  allegedly supposed to only be used for car jackings, motor vehicle theft, helping with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=370.0s)]
*  kidnapping cases, but after Roe versus Wade was overturned, we decided to be proactive in Illinois. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=378.88s)]
*  We passed a bill through our office that became law to make sure that automatic license plate readers [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  were not used for cases of abortion or immigration. I was very proud of that, quite frankly, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=392.4s)]
*  but I did not think that we would have to use this legislation, but what we found out a few weeks ago [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=398.0s)]
*  was that a law enforcement agency in Texas was using these automatic license plate readers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=403.12s)]
*  to target women who were traveling into Illinois for legal abortions and were tracking immigrants. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=410.56s)]
*  This is horrifying stuff. This is like straight out of a movie, Handmaid's Tale, and what we're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=419.36s)]
*  seeing is law enforcement agencies outside of Illinois weaponizing this technology against our [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  most vulnerable citizens, including those who are immigrants that are here legally, that are [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=432.48s)]
*  protected under Illinois law and women seeking legal health care. So I'm proud of our legislation. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=442.32s)]
*  We stepped up. We shut off any kind of ability for 46 different law enforcement agencies to track this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=448.24s)]
*  information. Again, this is like Handmaid's Tale type stuff, and I'm proud of the work that we're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  doing here in Illinois to fight back. We're the first day in the country, as of right now, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=463.12s)]
*  we're the only state in the country to afford these protections to Illinois citizens, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  but we hope that other states pick up this mantle and do the same thing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=472.0s)]
*  Let's talk about more broadly some of the ways you're able to use your office to fight back [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  against the Trump regime. You mentioned one way right there through auditing and making sure [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=483.52s)]
*  that this technology is not being used for nefarious purposes, but if you can speak to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  the broader plan and the broader strategy as the Trump regime is, I even think going beyond [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=496.08s)]
*  a lot of people's worst case nightmare scenarios, it's real. It's happening in the streets. This [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  isn't some make-believe world of hypotheticals. America, and you use the word too, authoritarian. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=510.88s)]
*  It looks like all of the conditions of authoritarianism are here right now, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=520.32s)]
*  and it's happening, and it's playing out most significantly in a state like Illinois. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=526.32s)]
*  I should begin by saying we are very fortunate in Illinois to have leaders who are stepping up. We [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=532.24s)]
*  have a governor who continues to do the right thing, who continues to act with courage, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=537.84s)]
*  who understands what's really at stake. Again, I don't think the average American is really [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=542.64s)]
*  paying attention to the bit-by-bit danger that's happening every day, every week, the corrosion of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=549.76s)]
*  these values that this country has always stood for. It's kind of like when you put a frog in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=556.0s)]
*  boiling water, they'll notice right away, but if you slowly start turning up the temperature, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  that's what's happening in America. We need people, not just elected officials, community leaders, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=565.76s)]
*  and activists, but we need everyday citizens to push back on this. It shouldn't matter whether [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=573.04s)]
*  you're a Democrat or Republican. Everyone should be disgusted by this behavior, this administration, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=578.72s)]
*  which by the way, not only is dangerous and acting like an authoritarian regime, but is also [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=585.28s)]
*  combining that with tremendous incompetence, the likes of which we've never seen coming out [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  of Washington, D.C. It's one thing to be dangerously callous and evil and to disrupt the entire world [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=599.04s)]
*  order, but you couple that with inability to get anything done, whether it's on the economic front, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  whether it's on the education front. Literally, I'm trying to find ways to find something that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=613.76s)]
*  this administration is doing properly, and we can't do it. We've taken a lot of action here in [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=618.08s)]
*  Illinois to make sure we protect information. We have 11 million individuals that have driver's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=622.88s)]
*  license and license plates. We keep this information out of the hands of ICE unless there's a warrant. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  We're protecting that data. Back to the automatic license plate readers, to me, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  it's bigger than just these automatic license plate readers per se. The insidious nature of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  this type of government surveillance extends beyond the violation of individual privacy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=647.28s)]
*  It corrodes the foundations of trust that, quite frankly, are essential [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  for a healthy democracy to have, and I think people need to pay attention to what's happening. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=667.52s)]
*  Again, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, your personal privacy should be protected. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=673.28s)]
*  Imagine the upheaval on Fox News if a Democratic administration was tracking the license plates [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  of folks that were going to a MAGA rally or a Donald Trump rally. It would be up in arms. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=686.8s)]
*  There would be lawsuits. It would be mayhem. We're saying, let's put those protections in place [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=692.72s)]
*  to do everything we can to make sure our democracy survives this unruly administration. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=697.52s)]
*  I think about all of the mantras that came from the right wing, which was all just a form of gas [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=705.92s)]
*  lighting. Therefore, states' rights, states' rights, but apparently now they believe that [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=713.04s)]
*  they should be able to nationalize, federalize the National Guard and send the Marines into states [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=719.92s)]
*  and take resources away from governors. All of the things that they've been saying over the past, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  however, it just seems really what they wanted was they wanted their Kim Jong-un. They wanted their [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=737.5999999999999s)]
*  ridiculous-looking, makeup-wearing, bizarro, two-week taco, Trump always chicken. It seems like they [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=744.8s)]
*  just wanted, they looked to North Korea. We were like, America's leading the world. They were like, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  nah, Kim Jong-un, and they got it. They're relishing this pain and suffering. I do think that [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=760.4s)]
*  things are changing. Have you noticed, though, just changes overall in how people in the state [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=770.24s)]
*  are feeling, even people who may have, for whatever reason, voted for this guy because he was promising [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=777.12s)]
*  lower prices or whatever he was defrauding people with? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm optimistic by nature. I'm noticing you're seeing these rallies, you're seeing these numbers, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=790.32s)]
*  you're seeing people step up and protest peacefully, by the way. That, to me, is very [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=794.16s)]
*  encouraging for our future. It makes me feel good that there's a buzz out there, that we can't let [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=800.4s)]
*  this happen. But two things that really have bothered me the last few weeks. One is the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=805.28s)]
*  Republican, outside of Donald Trump, the Republican senators, congressmen, congresswomen, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=811.36s)]
*  statewide officials. No one is pushing back. No one is stepping up and saying, this is really [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=818.16s)]
*  screwed up. What is this guy doing? That, to me, is really not to sound naive. Not one person is [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=823.92s)]
*  stepping up and saying, this guy is having a military parade for his birthday. What are we [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=830.64s)]
*  doing here? This guy is literally going into towns and separating people from their own kids and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=836.16s)]
*  their own grandparents who've done nothing wrong. Not one Republican is stepping up and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=842.56s)]
*  shouting from the rooftops or even calmly saying, hey, this is really out of line. This is not [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  what the future of America looks like. This is not the way to maintain our status as the global [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=854.8s)]
*  democratic leader that we're supposed to be. Not one person. So, am I optimistic? Am I encouraged [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  by what we've seen the last few weeks from people who are pushing back on this regime? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=867.92s)]
*  Yes. But I'm also really disheartened that you can't even get a little bit of courage from the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=873.28s)]
*  other side from a couple people to say, this is totally out of line. This is really fundamentally [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=878.0s)]
*  dangerous. And the irony, as you mentioned, is crazy. They don't want states to intervene. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  They don't want states to do this. And here they are. I don't know. I'm blown away by their [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=891.04s)]
*  ability to completely change their point of view just because Donald Trump is in office and just [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=900.16s)]
*  because they're afraid of getting primary. It's really horrifying. I want to ask you just one more [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=905.52s)]
*  topic while I have you here because in the past, I think you and I had discussed this and here we [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=912.24s)]
*  kind of are in this moment. We've heard a lot after the 2024 election about young men and young [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=918.64s)]
*  men being into this magosphere world and whatever, this bro-osphere world of the bullying and the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=926.56s)]
*  mocking of the trans community and mocking gay people. And I've always made it a point here on [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=936.96s)]
*  the show to remind people, let me be very clear, that behavior is unacceptable. It's not cool. We [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=945.68s)]
*  should not be chasing that. I always thought the cool kid growing up was the person who punched [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  back against the bully, who lifted people up, who helped marginalized communities. It didn't hurt [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  marginalized communities. I want to hear from your perspective. You're an athlete and I'm sure you've [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  heard that before. I just want to hear in this specific moment, because when I look at Trump [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=969.28s)]
*  and I look at the people who surround, who he surrounds, I look at them as losers. I look at [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=973.6s)]
*  them as just as weak men, as weak and pathetic people who are everything wrong with everything. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=978.24s)]
*  I would just love to hear your thoughts on that. I couldn't agree more. And that's something that's [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  very disconcerting to me. I was a professional basketball player, although my wife and kids [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  would say I'm not cool. I like to think I'm a relatively cool human being. And to your point, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  the people that I've always admired and looked up to, the people that are really cool and tough, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1004.4s)]
*  are the ones who stand up to bullies, are the ones that push back when someone makes fun of [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1008.24s)]
*  handicapped people or continues to exhibit racist undertones in almost every single speech he makes. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  Pete Hagsteth is not cool to me. I believe in people who are effective, people who push back [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1024.32s)]
*  on bullies, people who do the right thing, people who stand by their convictions, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1030.16s)]
*  people who fight for those who don't always have a voice fighting for them. And yeah, it's true. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1034.24s)]
*  There is a sort of male bravado to me, this overweight, dorky guy who tans his skin a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1039.68s)]
*  certain color and has this weird toupee-like haircut. What makes him cool? I don't get it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  I really don't. And more important than that, I was always raised that character is the most [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1053.84s)]
*  important thing in the world. And if you don't go to bed at night with character, feeling good that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  you're making a positive difference in people's lives, that's the only thing that matters. So [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  I never got it. I still don't get it. I think we need more guys to step up and push back on this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1073.52s)]
*  And again, it shouldn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican. If Donald Trump happened [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  to be a Democrat and was doing this sort of thing, I would be pushing back just as hard. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1084.96s)]
*  This is about the future of our democracy, the future of our planet, the future of our country. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  Again, my parents came to this country as immigrants. They believed in this country. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1093.84s)]
*  And here we are kicking foreign students out, which we need now more than ever. Here we are [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  making it so that people are scared to go to the grocery store, scared to go visit families, scared [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1103.84s)]
*  to go to work. So not only is this fundamentally dangerous to the future of our country, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1108.8s)]
*  it's also very damaging and the results will continue to play themselves out, very damaging [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  to our economy. So there's a moral argument. There's an economic argument. We just need people to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1119.52s)]
*  step up and push against someone who's really amounted to be just a dangerous bully. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1125.76s)]
*  Illinois Secretary of State Alexei Janulius. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyXKaB_PNs&t=1132.48s)]
