# GOP Witnesses LOSE CONTROL under CROSS EXAM at HEARING
**MeidasTouch:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8)
*  Democrats going on the offense in the House of Representatives and the Senate, cross-examining [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's cabinet members, putting them in their place, exposing them on live TV during these [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=6.16s)]
*  hearings. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=12.64s)]
*  I want to show you what went down in both the House and the Senate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=13.64s)]
*  So you had Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson testifying before the House of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=17.46s)]
*  Representatives. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=23.76s)]
*  The Congress member Gomez starts off by saying, how are you doing Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=25.68s)]
*  Besson? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=31.2s)]
*  Because I heard that Elon Musk rugby style, what checked you, he checked you in your gut. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=32.2s)]
*  So they got into a physical fight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=39.24s)]
*  Here's what went down. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=41.72s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=43.08s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=44.08s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, how are you doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=45.08s)]
*  So far so good. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=47.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=48.72s)]
*  I was just curious because I know Elon Musk body checked you at the White House. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=49.72s)]
*  No, I know I'm not saying to Elon Musk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=54.24s)]
*  You know that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  So you believe what you read on Breitbart is what you're telling this congressman. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=62.32s)]
*  If it's too sensitive for you, I won't ask that question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=63.32s)]
*  But let me move on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  I will take South Carolina over South Africa any day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=67.68s)]
*  Yeah, go for it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Just call out these people to their face. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=72.76s)]
*  And I love Democratic Congress member Tom Swazi from New York's third congressional [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=76.16s)]
*  district using his questioning to show that Treasury Secretary Scott Besant and Donald [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  Trump go against literally every single expert and economist in the United States and the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=86.84s)]
*  world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  This is how it's done with good cross-examining. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=97.12s)]
*  Now, you don't agree with the CBO. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=98.12s)]
*  We've heard that several times. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=99.12s)]
*  You also disagree with the Committee for Responsible Budget, who said that there's going to be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  a $3 trillion deficit from this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  You disagree with that also, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=107.2s)]
*  And you disagree with the Yale Budget Lab. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=109.28s)]
*  You went to Yale. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=110.88s)]
*  You don't agree with the Yale Budget Lab. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=111.88s)]
*  They say there's going to be a $3 trillion deficit from this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  You disagree with them also? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=115.08s)]
*  There are a lot of things I disagree with Yale on these. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=116.36s)]
*  You disagree with the Penn-Warton budget model, who said there's going to be a $3 trillion [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=119.52s)]
*  deficit from this bill? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  You disagree with Elon Musk, who you supposedly do get along with now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  It will massively increase the already gigantic deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=130.44s)]
*  citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=135.56s)]
*  Do you disagree with Mr. Musk on that issue? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  Do you disagree with Ray Dalio, who said that this is unsustainable? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  I agree with Ray Dalio that we need to get our fiscal house in order. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you disagree with Jamie Dimon, who says this is going to cause a crack in the bond [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=150.56s)]
*  markets? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  I met with Mr. Dimon the other day, and he wasn't necessarily referring to government [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  finances. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=161.24s)]
*  Well, he said there's going to be a crack that's going to take place in either six months [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=162.24s)]
*  or six years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's ask you, when do you think that's going to happen? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  I believe he was referring to market structure. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you disagree with Mr. Fink from BlackRock, who said this is going to be a sustainable [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=171.44s)]
*  problem as well? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=175.56s)]
*  Look, I believe that we have to get our fiscal house in order. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=177.0s)]
*  Then you've got Democratic Congress member Bayer just asking the question that I think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=181.6s)]
*  we all want to know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Aren't you just embarrassed with your life? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=187.48s)]
*  Scott Besant, Treasury Secretary Besant, aren't you just embarrassed and shamed to just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=190.2s)]
*  be you right now and have to come up here and lie and act like the GDP is doing great [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=196.12s)]
*  when it's actually we were in a contraction of our economy last quarter? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=207.72s)]
*  The administration is in retreat from key policy areas. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=208.72s)]
*  I want to say, given your successful past, isn't this embarrassing? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=211.8s)]
*  Is there a question there, sir? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  There's a question. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Isn't this embarrassing? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, is it embarrassing? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry, Congressman, but you seem not to have seen the economic data. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  The GDP growth has been quite substantial. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=229.64s)]
*  Job growth is solid. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  GDP growth is half what it was last year, sir. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=234.48s)]
*  Job growth is solid. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  Job growth is a third what it was all last year, sir. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=240.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=242.2s)]
*  And private sector job growth especially. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=243.28s)]
*  And if you'd like to talk about inflation, would you? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  The inflation has been coming down. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=250.88s)]
*  Just the inflation is good so far. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  We will see every economic thing I read, which is much every day, suggests the impact of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=254.2s)]
*  the terrorists is not too different. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=258.28s)]
*  Well, why don't we look at the data rather than the hysteria, which is how I made my [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=259.52s)]
*  career. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=265.08s)]
*  So while the Democrats were doing that, you had the MAGA Republicans like Marjorie Taylor [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=266.08s)]
*  Greene delivering speeches like the following. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=270.44s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=273.36s)]
*  He is now being charged on multiple felony counts for human trafficking. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=274.36s)]
*  As a matter of fact, we're thrilled to bring him back and prosecute him and make you guys [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=279.0s)]
*  continue to own him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=283.72s)]
*  Remember, he's your Maryland man. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=285.32s)]
*  Enough of that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=287.72s)]
*  Going back to the Democrats, here's Democratic Congresswoman Sowell. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=288.72s)]
*  And here she is questioning Treasury Secretary Scott Besant. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=293.44s)]
*  And just watch what he does. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=298.64s)]
*  And then she just is like, did I just hear what you said? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=301.4s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=304.68s)]
*  The last question that I was asked to ask you was, when will we hit the debt ceiling? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=306.04s)]
*  I know that this big, beautiful bill also means a debt, an increase in the debt ceiling. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, I heard you say that that is something that's an imperative. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  I would agree with that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=321.56s)]
*  When do we foresee us hitting the debt ceiling? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  Congresswoman, I want to congratulate you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  You have a very sophisticated constituency to ask questions like this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=328.48s)]
*  The so-called X date is a... [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  With all due respect, just because you're poor doesn't mean you're ignorant. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  As I said, very sophisticated. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=342.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=343.88s)]
*  So just can you answer the question? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=344.88s)]
*  I'm in the habit of saying thank you to compliments. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=345.88s)]
*  That the so-called X date is a moving target. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  So when do you for... [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=359.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, you're the Secretary of Treasury. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=360.23999999999995s)]
*  So tell me, when do you predict, given where we are right now, will we hit the ceiling? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=362.08s)]
*  Some point in the middle to late summer. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=367.2s)]
*  Is that August, July? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=370.64s)]
*  Again, it is imprecise. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, sir, I just think that it is an abomination that we are actually giving bigger tax cuts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=374.68s)]

*  Will you commit to giving us the specifics of that deal, the details? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  The Congresswoman, I flew back at 4 a.m. this morning to be here this morning and we are... [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=848.1s)]
*  It's a simple yes or no question. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=853.9s)]
*  No, it is not a simple yes or no question. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  We are in the midst of constructing it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=857.78s)]
*  Back to your question, China has proven an unreliable partner in strategic... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=861.66s)]
*  Will you commit to consulting with us on the trade deal with China? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=867.9399999999999s)]
*  Generalwoman's time has expired. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=871.3s)]
*  I would ask the witness to be allowed to answer that last question. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=873.46s)]
*  Generalwoman's time has expired. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=876.7s)]
*  It's a yes or no question. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=877.9s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=879.1s)]
*  Representative, I raise many of your concerns to the Chinese delegation and it will be a [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=880.18s)]
*  longer process. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=885.94s)]
*  The trade deal today or last night was for a specific goal and it will be a much longer [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=887.62s)]
*  process and I will note that the previous administration did nothing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=896.2600000000001s)]
*  Excuse me, the question was whether or not you would be... [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=900.94s)]
*  Generalwoman's time has expired. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=903.34s)]
*  Mr. Arrington's time... [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=904.34s)]
*  Here's Congresswoman Sanchez again to Besant. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=905.94s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=908.2600000000001s)]
*  Don't you believe that the President's tariffs are going to be a one-time price adjustment [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=909.2600000000001s)]
*  for American families? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=913.5s)]
*  If prices go up, they will be one time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=916.5s)]
*  Okay, well, unfortunately, you appear to be talking out of both sides of your mouth because [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=920.34s)]
*  you yourself have admitted after conversations with Walmart that some tariff costs are going [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=925.2600000000001s)]
*  to get passed on to consumers and in fact, we've already seen that prices are rising [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=930.74s)]
*  on many everyday goods. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=935.0200000000001s)]
*  No, Congresswoman, today we had a 1.1 increase. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=936.98s)]
*  Please don't interrupt me. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=938.9000000000001s)]

*  I know I'm a woman, but please try to limit yourself to answering my questions. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=951.26s)]
*  No, I'm sorry, but we get talked over all the time and I don't want that to happen at [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=956.06s)]
*  this hearing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=961.5799999999999s)]
*  I would remind members. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=962.5799999999999s)]
*  The gentlelady is recognized. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=963.5799999999999s)]
*  Please proceed. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=966.8199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  The time is mine. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=968.8199999999999s)]
*  We have a Democratic Senator Reid from Rhode Island cross-examining Pete Hegseth, the former [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=969.82s)]
*  Fox host who's now somehow the Secretary of Defense. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=977.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=980.9000000000001s)]
*  There's a general understanding that you have taken possession of this Qatari aircraft, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=981.9000000000001s)]
*  the 747, but there are public reports that Qatari's have not yet signed a memorandum [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=987.22s)]
*  of understanding, which would specify that the agreement was initiated by the Trump administration [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=994.46s)]
*  and Qatar is not responsible for any future transfers of the plane's ownership. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1001.74s)]
*  Are you in possession of the Qatari airplane now? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1007.78s)]
*  Any specifics about future aircraft that could be Air Force One can't be discussed here, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1011.1800000000001s)]
*  but there is a conversation about a memorandum of understanding. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1016.94s)]
*  A memorandum of understanding remains to be signed, Senator. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1020.26s)]
*  You have signed a contract with a company to reconfigure the aircraft. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1024.7s)]
*  What is the price of that contract? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1033.14s)]
*  That cannot be revealed in this setting. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1036.38s)]
*  Why can't it be revealed in this setting? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1037.9s)]
*  This is the appropriation committee of the United States Senate. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1039.6200000000001s)]
*  We appropriate the money that you will spend after it's authorized by my committee, and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1042.7s)]
*  you cannot tell us how much the contract is for. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1047.74s)]
*  You will have that number, Senator. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1050.3600000000001s)]
*  It just can't be talked about in public. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1051.5s)]
*  You want it now. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1052.5s)]
*  The contract has been signed, correct? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1053.5s)]
*  The contract has been signed? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1056.14s)]
*  The memorandum of understanding is not complete. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1057.66s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the contract with the American contractor. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1059.66s)]
*  Has it been signed? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1063.82s)]
*  It's nothing on that front that I'm aware of as being executed. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1066.14s)]
*  Well, that's contrary to what we've all heard. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1070.74s)]
*  Second thing, what's the delivery time in the contract? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1074.82s)]
*  Again, the delivery time of anything of that sensitive nature is not for public consumption. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1079.1s)]
*  Can you tell me the delivery time for the Boeing aircraft that were being prepared for [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1084.4599999999998s)]
*  Air Force One? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1088.54s)]
*  Was that in the contract? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1089.54s)]
*  Well, one of the problems is that the way we actually procure aircraft in this country [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1090.54s)]
*  takes so long. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1095.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1096.1399999999999s)]
*  When it's ordered, it's seven, eight, nine, ten years late, requiring the necessity for [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1097.1399999999999s)]
*  a stopgap alternative. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1101.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  What you've just said is that the Boeing information was public knowledge. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1104.5s)]
*  The delivery date, the cost, the cost overruns, but this is not because this is not only a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1109.3s)]
*  bad deal for the American public. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1117.26s)]
*  It is just gratifying the President's ego. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1119.46s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1123.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1124.94s)]
*  Here he is again, questioning Hegseth about, what the hell are you doing with the Marines [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1125.94s)]
*  in Los Angeles? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1130.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1132.06s)]
*  The more accountable you are, the higher your standards are, it all makes you more lethal. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1133.06s)]
*  The mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1137.62s)]
*  It's about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1142.36s)]
*  their job without being attacked by mobs of people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1147.1s)]
*  We're very proud that the National Guard and the Marines are on the streets defending the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1150.3s)]
*  ICE agents and they will continue to do that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1156.74s)]
*  Law and order is a civil function under the Constitution of the United States. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1158.54s)]
*  Civil enforcement, law enforcement authorities, not the U.S. military. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1163.78s)]
*  There's plenty of precedent for the U.S. military supporting law enforcement officers. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1170.5s)]
*  What your military is doing right now is laying concentrino wire, guarding buildings, maintaining [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1174.06s)]
*  vehicles for other services. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1179.3400000000001s)]
*  This is not only, I think, illegal, but also a diminution of the readiness and the focus [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1182.5s)]
*  of the military. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1189.34s)]
*  I thought this was great questioning by Democratic Senator Schatz. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1190.34s)]
*  Here he is questioning the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cain. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1195.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1198.94s)]
*  I'll start with General Cain. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1199.94s)]
*  Is the United States being invaded by a foreign nation? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1202.74s)]
*  Sir, thanks for your question. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1207.94s)]
*  I think at this point in time, I don't see any foreign state sponsored folks invading, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1212.54s)]
*  but I'll be mindful of the fact that there has been some border issues throughout time [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1220.8200000000002s)]
*  and defer to DHS who handles the border along the nation's contiguous outline. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1226.1000000000001s)]
*  Is there a rebellion somewhere in the United States? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1235.3s)]
*  Sir, I think there's definitely some frustrated folks out there. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1240.3s)]
*  I mean, frustrated folks were a rebellion. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1250.86s)]
*  Here he is again questioning Hegseth. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1253.5s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1255.78s)]
*  And I guess that goes to my question for the Secretary. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1256.78s)]
*  Two things. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1259.98s)]
*  There should be some sort of paper flow that the committee, the Congress, the public can [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1260.98s)]
*  look at in invoking Title X, Section 12406. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1268.34s)]
*  So can you give us some clarification on whether the orders that were issued apply to specifically [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1277.46s)]
*  Los Angeles, to California generally, or is this a nationwide order? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1289.18s)]
*  The orders that have been issued, which are publicly available and known, relate to an [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1295.94s)]
*  ongoing situation in Los Angeles, which could expand to other places. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1301.3400000000001s)]
*  But it's quite easy to point out that there has been an invasion of 21 million illegals [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1306.9s)]
*  in our country under the previous administration. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1311.96s)]
*  So this administration was elected to get a hold of that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  When you have ICE officers being attacked with concrete blocks, they should be allowed [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1318.5800000000002s)]
*  to do their job. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1323.38s)]
*  Secretary, I'd really like to not try to create a viral moment for either of us. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1324.38s)]
*  I'm actually trying to understand kind of the scope of this order. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1327.9s)]
*  And then finally, we have Democratic Senator Murray, I think just summing it all up in [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1331.94s)]
*  her questioning to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1337.0200000000002s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1340.38s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, you oversee one of the largest and most important organizations on [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1341.38s)]
*  planet Earth. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1347.38s)]
*  More than anything, the Department of Defense needs stable, competent, and strategic leadership. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1349.3400000000001s)]
*  And much as I had feared back in January is not what we are seeing under your leadership. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1357.0600000000002s)]
*  In a matter of months, you have lost top aides and reportedly struggled to hire new ones. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1362.0600000000002s)]
*  You have fired highly respected top military officials. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1367.74s)]
*  You shared highly sensitive attack plans over Signal and apparently with people in your [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1372.1000000000001s)]
*  own personal circles. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1376.82s)]
*  And you've not taken responsibility for those mistakes. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  All the while the security challenges we face have grown larger, not smaller. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1382.1799999999998s)]
*  And then in the face of these challenges, you've taken a series of actions that weaken [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1387.4199999999998s)]
*  our posture. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  For example, in my home state of Washington, which is home to many DOD installations, critical [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1392.1399999999999s)]
*  to our Indo-Pacific strategy, you have pushed out almost 2000 highly trained civilian employees, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  including a Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1406.6200000000001s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you talk about returning the department to its mission of warfighting, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1408.8600000000001s)]
*  but I am repeatedly hearing that your policy and personnel changes at the Pentagon are [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1413.9s)]
*  undermining, not strengthening our military's preparedness to protect our country. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1419.22s)]
*  You are deploying the American military to police the American people. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1426.3s)]
*  You're sending the National Guard into California without the governor's request. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1430.74s)]
*  You're sending the Marines not after foreign threats, but after American protesters. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1435.3s)]
*  And now President Trump is promising heavy force against peaceful protesters at his D.C. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1440.58s)]
*  military parade. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1446.7s)]
*  Those sorts of actions and that sort of rhetoric from a president of the United States should [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1448.22s)]
*  stop every one of us cold. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1453.5s)]
*  Threatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1456.06s)]
*  It is unconstitutional and it is downright un-American. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1461.92s)]
*  We should all be speaking out against this and demanding accountability. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1466.4s)]
*  Yeah, powerful questioning indeed. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1470.64s)]
*  Oh, that's what I want to see. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1472.92s)]
*  I want to see Democrats go on the offense like this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1474.8000000000002s)]
*  It's good to see. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1477.28s)]
*  I want to see them fight. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYuz-YorQ8&t=1478.28s)]
