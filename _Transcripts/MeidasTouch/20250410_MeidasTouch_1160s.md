# PANICKED Trump REEKS OF FEAR as Markets GET TWISTED
**MeidasTouch:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM)
*  So, did Donald Trump blink yesterday? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=0.0s)]
*  Was he terrified seeing the bond market implode? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=2.5s)]
*  Was he manipulating the market? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=5.86s)]
*  Was he just trying to do another distraction? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=7.5s)]
*  Was it all of the above? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=10.38s)]
*  Let's explore and let's not ignore some of the other disastrous things Donald Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=11.66s)]
*  did yesterday, like signing executive orders, directing the Department of Justice to investigate [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=17.18s)]
*  Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs because he said that they believe that the election from 2020 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=23.7s)]
*  was not stolen and because he believes the election was stolen and they're outspoken [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=30.9s)]
*  against Donald Trump's election lies, they need to be criminally investigated. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=36.3s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=42.1s)]
*  We are all Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=43.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is just waiting for the time to go after all of us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=47.26s)]
*  Let's explore first the financial and let's go into some of these other areas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=51.66s)]
*  So, right yesterday Donald Trump announces, voila, these big beautiful tariffs that are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=55.699999999999996s)]
*  going to make us all rich. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  He's pausing the tariffs on the entire world that he imposed based on a fake formula. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  Other than China, he raised the tariffs against China to 125%, but the rest of the world will [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=68.34s)]
*  be tariffed at 10%, but all of those other tariffs that were above that 10% based on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=74.9s)]
*  that fake formula, those would be paused for a 90 day period. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=80.62s)]
*  So here's the headline from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=84.7s)]
*  Why Trump blinked on tariffs just hours after they went into effect. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=87.7s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson helped persuade Donald Trump to take time to negotiate with [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=91.86s)]
*  trading partners in face of pressure from business leaders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump gave press conferences yesterday where he said he was scared. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  Things weren't going as planned. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  The markets were getting spooked and he was using words like that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=107.38s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, Trump's propagandist, Caroline Leavitt said, this was all part of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=111.06s)]
*  the art of the deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  This was all part of the plan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  So the plan was to lie to the people, lie to the markets, lie to corporations, lie to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=118.94s)]
*  the world, crash the markets, wipe out $10 trillion from the markets and then say that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  was the plan to begin with. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=129.62s)]
*  And you think that you haven't lost all credibility. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=131.68s)]
*  Well, you've already lost it pretty much months ago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=134.78s)]
*  And I think even before then, if anybody's ever been paying attention to this, but let's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=137.38s)]
*  keep going. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=141.38s)]
*  I want to talk about market manipulation soon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=142.38s)]
*  I'm going to do a whole video, by the way, on market manipulation this morning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  I want you to watch that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=149.1s)]
*  I'm going to post that soon on the YouTube channel where I will break it down from a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=150.22s)]
*  legal perspective, what I would investigate, the questions I would ask. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=154.46s)]
*  Take a look at this headline from the New York Times, from be cool to getting yippee [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=158.16s)]
*  Inside Trump's reversal on tariffs, economic turmoil, particularly a rapid rise in government [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  bond yields, caused President Trump to reverse course on the steep levies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  The real credit Mr. Trump's advisors admit privately should go to the bond markets. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=173.78s)]
*  Trump's decision was driven by fear that his tariffs gamble could quickly turn into a financial [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=179.18s)]
*  crisis directly attributable to only one man, as Scott Galloway explained. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=184.34s)]
*  As a result, what Trump did is he pulled the knife halfway out of the economy's back, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  the injury, no longer a reliable trading partner, will take years to heal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=196.42s)]
*  Hashtag stupid Spencer at Kimian keeps a running list for everyone of all the things that Donald [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=202.46s)]
*  Trump and his regime have been stating about tariffs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  Tariffs are going to bring jobs back. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=212.54s)]
*  So why are you pausing it, Donald? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=214.74s)]
*  Tariffs are actually going to stop all fentanyl deaths. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=216.66s)]
*  So why are you pausing it, Donald? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=219.7s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to negotiate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=221.9s)]
*  So why are you pausing them, Donald? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=224.06s)]
*  Tariffs are actually for external revenue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=226.3s)]
*  We're going to get rid of the IRS. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=228.98s)]
*  So why are you pausing them, Donald? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=230.74s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to crash bond yields. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=233.1s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to raise bond yields. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=235.24s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to fix trade deficits. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=237.38s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to make the world stop depending on us and abusing us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=239.82s)]
*  Tariffs are actually to make everyone be our ally again and only be China's enemies [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=244.74s)]
*  now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  Keep adding to that list that Kimian is making. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  As I mentioned before, Trump paused most tariffs for 90 days amid economic turmoil. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=254.78s)]
*  He adds that he has authorized substantially lower reciprocal tariffs during this period [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=259.76s)]
*  of about 10 percent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=264.58s)]
*  But when you actually look at the tariff rate to the world, then you actually look at it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=267.1s)]
*  from a blended perspective. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=272.42s)]
*  The overall tariffs to the world where you include China's in a blended average and all [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=274.34s)]
*  these other countries at 10 percent and then the other tariffs that still apparently remain, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=278.7s)]
*  although with the chaos in Trump, it was like unclear which tariffs are there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=283.9s)]
*  Is Canada and Mexico? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=287.58s)]
*  Are those tariffs on? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=288.58s)]
*  Steel, aluminum, are those tariffs on? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=289.94s)]
*  But it seems like a blended rate of somewhere around 23 to 25 percent from like 2 percent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=291.84s)]
*  where it was before. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=297.38s)]
*  So that's going to raise the prices. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=298.82s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, as according to Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary, this was all part [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  of the plan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=307.22s)]
*  Screw the market. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=308.22s)]
*  Wipe away $10 trillion. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=310.06s)]
*  Tons of parents were tapping their 529 college accounts for their kids because that was part [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  of the plan apparently by the Treasury Secretary. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  Scott Besson said, or as Senator Brian Schaetz says, our plan is working perfectly and is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=321.42s)]
*  just a negotiation tactic, but it's also going to be permanent and we will be the world [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=328.1s)]
*  leader in textiles. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=332.38s)]
*  And now there is a pause and everyone needs to chill, but also we will never back down [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=333.38s)]
*  or as we've done the kind of cycle of Trump's stupidity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=338.3s)]
*  I make a stupid decision. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=341.94s)]
*  Something really bad happens. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  I convince my followers the problem is now magically solved. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=345.18s)]
*  I reverse my stupid decisions. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  Want to explore the market manipulation case? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to do this in a longer video as well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=354.54s)]
*  Take a look at the Nasdaq call volume spiking minutes before the 90 day tariff pause was [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=357.38s)]
*  announced. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=363.82s)]
*  As Spencer Akimian says, not a good look at all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=364.82s)]
*  Someone knew. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=368.58s)]
*  When did they know it? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=369.58s)]
*  Why did they know it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=370.58s)]
*  How did they get this information? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=371.58s)]
*  And you'll see all of a sudden a spike in volume. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=373.9s)]
*  People were very much aware of what was going on. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=377.26s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump did make a post earlier in the morning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=379.17999999999995s)]
*  Now is a good time to buy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=382.34s)]
*  Hell says that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  Was that the signal? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  But even before then we saw spikes taking place and unusual behavior. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=387.1s)]
*  If you look at some of the exchanges and some of the funds that trade parallel to the exchanges, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  like one of them is called SPY, which trades alongside the S&P and it basically takes their [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=400.86s)]
*  kind of relative percentages and you basically trade the S&P. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  It's called SPY. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  There's one called QQQ and TQQQ, which trades alongside the Nasdaq. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=412.14s)]
*  Those calls were up dramatically and rapidly before the announcement. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=418.02s)]
*  It seems that some people had significant knowledge. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  One of the case that this was a plan from the outset, one we know that Donald Trump [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=427.97999999999996s)]
*  has a history of being a fraud, he was found civilly liable for fraud, number one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=433.3s)]
*  Number two, he's a felon. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=437.94s)]
*  Number three, he's a sexual predator. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=439.82s)]
*  Number four, he bankrupts business. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=441.42s)]
*  Number five, he's Donald Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  But go back to this video right here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=445.3s)]
*  December 12th, 2024, Donald Trump goes to the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=447.54s)]
*  He's standing with Jim Cramer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember this moment where Jim Cramer asks Donald Trump, should working people buy more [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=454.1s)]
*  stock? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  And Trump says, I don't know. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  I would not want them to be in a situation where we have a dip or something. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=462.86s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump said back in December of 2024. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=468.94s)]
*  Remember this? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=471.86s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=472.86s)]
*  I know you've got a ton of things to do, but what can you say to the working person who [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=473.86s)]
*  owns stocks? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=477.18s)]
*  Should they buy more stock? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=478.18s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=479.5s)]
*  because that can always happen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=483.54s)]
*  You know that better than anybody in the world. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=484.72s)]
*  Probably. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=486.5s)]
*  I think you're the leading authority in going up and going down, but you always end up. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=487.5s)]
*  He always ends up. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=491.74s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  But we have like Doug Burgum standing right over here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  He's done a fantastic job. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  He's been on your show many times and we have we have just tremendous people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=497.66s)]
*  I would say this, I think long term, this is going to be a country like no other. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=501.70000000000005s)]
*  We had the three best years ever until COVID came in and then we did a good job getting [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=506.1s)]
*  rid of it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=511.38000000000005s)]
*  The stock market, if you look at the markets, were higher than just previous to COVID coming [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=512.38s)]
*  in when we handed it over. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=516.26s)]
*  So then yesterday, here's Donald Trump saying why he instituted a pause because people were [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=519.38s)]
*  getting yippy here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=524.7s)]
*  Just a few hours later, there was a pause put in on the terrace. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=525.7s)]
*  Can you walk us through what you're thinking about? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=532.1s)]
*  Why you decided to put a 90 day pause? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=535.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=537.86s)]
*  They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=542.5s)]
*  unlike these champions, because we have a big job to do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=547.6600000000001s)]
*  No other president would have done what I did. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=551.0600000000001s)]
*  No other president. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=553.0200000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't have done it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=554.62s)]
*  The ways and means Democrats posted the following as the markets were crashing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=556.14s)]
*  Color me yippy yippy and afraid. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's chief propagandist, said this was all part of the art of the deal. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=563.22s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=568.1s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=569.1s)]
*  Excuse me, Raquel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=570.1s)]
*  If I could just add to what the secretary said, many of you in the media clearly missed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=571.1s)]
*  the art of the deal. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=575.62s)]
*  You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=576.86s)]
*  You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China when in fact [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=580.98s)]
*  we've seen the opposite effect. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=584.9s)]
*  The entire world is calling the United States of America not China because they need our [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=586.5s)]
*  markets, they need our consumers, and they need this president in the Oval Office to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=591.38s)]
*  talk to them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=595.3s)]
*  And that's exactly why more than 75 countries have called because the United States of America [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=596.3s)]
*  is the best place in the world to do business. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=600.5s)]
*  And as the president has shown great courage, as the secretary has said, in choosing to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=603.26s)]
*  retaliate against China even higher. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=606.7s)]
*  And by the way, this is not getting a lot of attention, so I want to give it attention [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=609.7s)]
*  here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  There was a hearing that was held with Trump's nominee to head NASA, a guy named Jared Isaacman, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  who really, really, really did not, as Jamie Dupree explains, did not want to admit that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=619.82s)]
*  Elon Musk was in his meeting with Trump over NASA because Elon Musk, getting them government [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=625.5s)]
*  contracts, I think got what, SpaceX got what, like $5.6 billion from the federal government [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=633.14s)]
*  recently. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=640.5s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=641.5s)]
*  Was Elon Musk in your meeting when Trump offered you the NASA position at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=642.5s)]
*  Senator, I was interviewed by the president of the United States. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=647.14s)]
*  Was Elon Musk in the meeting when he offered you the job? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=649.98s)]
*  Senator, my meeting was with the president of the United States. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=652.6999999999999s)]
*  So Elon Musk was not in the meeting, is that what you're saying? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=655.18s)]
*  Senator, I was being interviewed and speaking with the president of the United States. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=658.18s)]
*  You can just say he was not in the meeting. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  Was he in the meeting or not in the meeting? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=663.74s)]
*  Senator, I'm trying to be as transparent as I can. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=666.18s)]
*  I was being interviewed by the president of the United States. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not a difficult question. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=671.42s)]
*  Was Elon Musk in the room when the president offered you the job? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  Senator, I was, again, my meeting was with the president of the United States. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=676.5s)]
*  I'm assuming that you don't want to answer the question directly because Elon Musk was [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=680.4599999999999s)]
*  in the room, unless you wanted to spell us with that notion. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=686.86s)]
*  Senator, again, I was being interviewed by the president of the United States. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=691.2199999999999s)]
*  How embarrassing is that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=694.14s)]
*  Now, as I said, with all the chaos going on, I don't want to get distracted from a lot of things. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=695.06s)]
*  Prices are not going down. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=699.3s)]
*  Prices are going up. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=700.6199999999999s)]
*  One of the things we learned is one of the ways the Trump regime is trying to take down [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=702.78s)]
*  egg prices is buying them from foreign countries that, by the way, were tariffing and then [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=705.9799999999999s)]
*  selling them for lower prices here to manipulate the market when it comes to eggs. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=710.9s)]
*  There's always a scam with Donald Trump, but prices are going to still be surging. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=715.4599999999999s)]
*  The blended tariff rate internationally is now 25%. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=720.98s)]
*  If 125% tariffs on China means all your stuff from Amazon, all the stuff that you're buying [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=725.06s)]
*  is going to be a lot more expensive. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=730.98s)]
*  Think about what the cost of an iPhone is going to be very soon. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  JPMorgan still has a 60% chance of recession based on Donald Trump's arbitrary and capricious [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=737.38s)]
*  nature and behavior. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=743.78s)]
*  And I don't want to forget that Donald Trump signed these executive orders yesterday [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=745.74s)]
*  directing the Department of Justice to go after Chris Krebs, who ran cybersecurity, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=749.9s)]
*  was a major player in the intelligence community protecting the 2020 elections from interference [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=755.1s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=761.66s)]
*  And Chris Krebs said it was a free and fair and safe election. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=762.66s)]
*  So Donald Trump hates Chris Krebs because Chris Krebs was technically part of the Trump [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=766.42s)]
*  administration, Miles Taylor as well, who was a whistleblower against Trump. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=770.74s)]
*  And look, what Trump wants to do to Krebs and Miles Taylor, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=774.98s)]
*  he wants to do to all of us here. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  But play this clip of Donald Trump signing the executive order yesterday and whining [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=780.9s)]
*  that the election was rigged. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=784.74s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=785.98s)]
*  And this guy Krebs was saying, oh, the election was great. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=786.98s)]
*  It was great. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=792.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, it's been proven that it was not only not great. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=793.1800000000001s)]
*  When you look at all these lawyers and law firms that are signing, giving us hundreds [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=797.02s)]
*  of millions of dollars, it was proven by so many different ways and so many different [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=802.38s)]
*  forms from the legislature's not approving to the 51 intelligence agents that worked [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=808.46s)]
*  from all of the different scamming operations. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=816.62s)]
*  It was a very corrupt election. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=819.9000000000001s)]
*  They use COVID to cheat. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=822.46s)]
*  And I also want to mention this story because it's not getting enough attention as well. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=824.7800000000001s)]
*  Despite being called one of the top three MS-13 leaders by the Trump regime, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=829.74s)]
*  federal prosecutors yesterday moved to dismiss the charges against Henry Santos. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=836.6199999999999s)]
*  This was one of the individuals, they did this whole press conference with Bondi [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=842.9399999999999s)]
*  and Cash Patel. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=847.9s)]
*  And they said, this guy's MS-13. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=849.42s)]
*  Well, very quietly, the Trump regime moved to dismiss the charges against the person [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=851.66s)]
*  they said was the main leader of MS-13. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=858.38s)]
*  And one of the things that they want to do is not have to go through a trial. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=861.82s)]
*  They want to take him now and then send him to El Salvador without process. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=866.38s)]
*  They don't want to have to go through the court system to prove the evidence against [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=870.94s)]
*  them. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=875.66s)]
*  Now look, which is due process. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=875.74s)]
*  If the evidence shows that he's MS-13 and he's a criminal, then the guy should be in [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=878.14s)]
*  jail forever, you know, or whatever the time the judge sentences him to. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=882.14s)]
*  We all think bad gang members and people who commit crimes should go to jail. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=886.3s)]
*  What the Trump regime wants to do here, though, after saying he's MS-13, is send him to El [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=890.94s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=895.74s)]
*  So they want to dismiss it, snatch him, disappear him to El Salvador versus go through a trial. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=896.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=901.6600000000001s)]
*  The Trump regime was bragging on March 5th about extraditing, bringing people into the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=903.2600000000001s)]
*  United States who are MS-13 to try them in the United States legal system. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=908.7800000000001s)]
*  That's not uncommon to bring these gang members in who are coordinating gang activity [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=914.46s)]
*  abroad, not to let them free on the streets, to put them in prisons in the United States. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=920.38s)]
*  We have a due process system and then it goes through a process where they're charged and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=925.66s)]
*  there's prosecution the way like El Chapo was found guilty. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=931.02s)]
*  He was in the highest prison facility that there is, highest guard of prison facility. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=934.22s)]
*  Went through a process guilty because there's more supposed to be more security here than [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=938.86s)]
*  like in the Mexican prisons when Chapo left. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=943.26s)]
*  So what are we talking like? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=946.14s)]
*  What are we even talking about here? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=947.58s)]
*  They want to disappear people and they think that they have a green light to do that right [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=949.34s)]
*  now. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  Also, the House of Representatives introduced a bill, H.R. 1526, to basically stop federal [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=955.98s)]
*  judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, which the Trump judges did all the time under [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=963.66s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=969.34s)]
*  That passed the House. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=971.18s)]
*  It goes to the Senate. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=972.22s)]
*  I don't think the Senate's going to pass that at all. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=973.1s)]
*  One of the interesting things though, as they're talking about all these activist judges, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=976.38s)]
*  a lot of these judges are appointed by George W. Bush, who are issuing injunctions against [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=981.5s)]
*  Trump. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=986.78s)]
*  Judge McFadden, who issued the injunction reinstating the Associated Press in the White [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=987.42s)]
*  House after Trump blocked the Associated Press because they called the Gulf of Mexico, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=992.54s)]
*  Gulf of Mexico, not the Gulf of America, Judge McFadden, a Trump appointee. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=998.14s)]
*  All these activist judges, you mean your own judges, George W. Bush judges? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1003.1s)]
*  Sure, judges appointed by Biden and Obama and others, but their injunction frequency [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1007.02s)]
*  is because you frequently are committing crimes and violating the law. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1011.66s)]
*  That's why. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1015.66s)]
*  Two other stories I want to mention right now. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1017.3399999999999s)]
*  Number one, a Delaware judge has made a finding that Newsmax affirmatively defamed Dominion. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1019.1s)]
*  This is a legal finding, meaning the trial will now just be about damages. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1028.3000000000002s)]
*  You'll recall Newsmax went public. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1033.5s)]
*  The stock went up to like $100 and then kind of pumped up and looks like a Trump meme coin [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1036.38s)]
*  or the American economy right now. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1042.7s)]
*  And then it crashed to like, I think it's at like 33 right now, but it's still got a market cap [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1044.46s)]
*  pretty freaking high right now. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1049.18s)]
*  And so Newsmax going to trial next month just on damages. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1051.5s)]
*  They've been found liable for the conduct itself of defaming. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1055.82s)]
*  So it's just the money at this point. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1061.02s)]
*  So I think Dominion's well-placed for either getting a huge settlement bigger than Fox, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1062.78s)]
*  especially now that Newsmax went public, but we'll be following that story right there. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1068.06s)]
*  And also yesterday, I'll do a whole video on this as well, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1073.34s)]
*  so keep checking back on our YouTube channel. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1076.62s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson was supposed to pass the Senate's version of the budget blueprint [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1079.5s)]
*  and then reconcile it to push forward Trump's tax agenda and budget agenda. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1086.3s)]
*  But he didn't get the votes in the House of Representatives. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1094.06s)]
*  That got derailed. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1096.94s)]
*  And so that's moved to today. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1098.54s)]
*  We'll see if there are votes today and what's going to happen. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1100.22s)]
*  But the Senate budget has spending cuts of about $4 billion. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1102.54s)]
*  The House has cuts of about $1.5 trillion. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1107.74s)]
*  So they're figuring out how to, I guess, deal with that. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1110.94s)]
*  But it was very embarrassing for Maga Mike Johnson. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1113.42s)]
*  So we covered a lot of ground, a lot of stories right there. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-b2zy1txM&t=1116.46s)]
