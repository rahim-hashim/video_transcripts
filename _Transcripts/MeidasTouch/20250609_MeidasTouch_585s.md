# OMG!!! Trump THROWS Troops ON FLOOR as HE SPIRALS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw)
*  We're now seeing some horrific pictures of National Guard troops sleeping on the floor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=0.0s)]
*  This was an exclusive from the San Francisco Chronicle. Wildly unprepared, National Guard [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=6.08s)]
*  troops seen sleeping on floors in exclusive photos when Donald Trump, in my view, unlawfully [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=12.0s)]
*  federalized the National Guard. They were not prepared for it. They didn't go through the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=18.88s)]
*  proper channels, of course. That's the subject of a major lawsuit that was filed by California [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=23.92s)]
*  Attorney General's office and the governor's office today. Governor Gavin Newsom posted the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  following at Donald Trump. You sent your troops here without fuel, without food, without water, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  or a place to sleep. Here they are being forced to sleep on the floor piled on top of another. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you. Earlier, Donald Trump posted the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=49.36s)]
*  following. We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=56.8s)]
*  instigated riots in California. If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  obliterated. Then he goes on to ad hominem attacks against Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass. He says, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=68.56s)]
*  the very incompetent governor, and he puts that in quotes, Gavin Newsom, and then he says, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=74.96s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass should be saying, thank you, President Trump. You are so wonderful. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  We would be nothing without you, sir. He goes on to just say more ridiculous things like that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  Then previously he posted, I'm liberating Los Angeles with the National Guard. I'm engaged in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=92.72s)]
*  a liberation operation. As someone who lives in Los Angeles, I can't begin to tell you how offensive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  it is as someone whose wife grew up in Huntington Park, whose nieces and nephews are graduating [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=104.56s)]
*  today, and they're seeing ice roll around their graduation, and I'm getting reports of how scared [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=110.72s)]
*  they are. It hits me very, very personally as well. Then there are unconfirmed reports, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=116.64s)]
*  and I want to be very clear. It's unconfirmed as of this recording, but it's been stated in a few [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=122.48s)]
*  news outlets. Again, let me be very clear with my language about a Marine battalion, around 500 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=128.4s)]
*  Marines based out of 29 POMs in California being mobilized in the Los Angeles area. We saw at [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=133.44s)]
*  least though from 29 POMs battalion that they're in communication at least with Hegsut. We can say [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=141.12s)]
*  that because I saw their release on that. Let's bring in Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Can you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=148.96s)]
*  just give us the latest? Let's just start there. What's the latest? What do we know? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=155.44s)]
*  Well, the latest is that right now there is a protest that is going on in solidarity with David [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  Huerta, who was the labor leader that was arrested and is in detention. He was hurt at his arrest [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=167.68s)]
*  and was briefly hospitalized. That is what is going on now. It is a peaceful protest. In Los [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=174.4s)]
*  Angeles, we have a well-organized, highly sophisticated immigrant rights movement here, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=180.64s)]
*  and they traditionally hold protests. They have all been peaceful. At the end of some of them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=187.44s)]
*  recently, things got completely out of hand, but not to the point that we needed the federalization [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=194.96s)]
*  of our National Guard. The way this works normally is that a request would have gone to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=202.16s)]
*  governor from the local law enforcement authorities requesting assistance. That request never went out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=207.92s)]
*  To preempt and to take away the governor's power over the National Guard is over the top. It makes [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=215.84s)]
*  us feel like we're a case study. What happens if the federal government comes in and takes over the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=222.4s)]
*  city? We saw the press release from Friday, and the press release said that these protests were [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=228.96s)]
*  largely all peaceful. They actually thanked the community organizers. I know there's a lot of work [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=237.68s)]
*  and effort that goes into also building trust between law enforcement and community organizers, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=243.92s)]
*  but then the language and the rhetoric out of Washington and the Trump regime [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  started escalating things and escalating things. They've always singled out you and Governor [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=255.44s)]
*  Newsom and Los Angeles in particular. Do you think that this was always a premeditated plan? He was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=261.68s)]
*  just waiting for the opportunity, Trump, that is, to do this? Well, I think the irony is here is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=269.28s)]
*  that we went through the wildfires, and the Trump administration was very supportive of that effort. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=277.28s)]
*  We're so far along because of that support. This is like a complete change, and it's very frightening [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  to the city. I just can't describe enough how traumatized families are. When people go to work [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=291.44s)]
*  and they don't know whether or not they're going to come home, when kids are not sure whether their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=298.4s)]
*  parents are going to come home. I just learned this morning that at my grandson's elementary school, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  that ICE was nearby. They're worried as to what's going to happen to the city that is 50% Latino, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=310.56s)]
*  about 20% Asian, and there are immigrants from all around the world, the Caribbean countries, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=318.96s)]
*  African countries. When those raids happen, it creates a sense of terror. We don't know how long [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=325.92s)]
*  it's going to last. We've been told 30 days. We never know when the raids, where the raids are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=335.44s)]
*  going to take place. Several have happened today already. We're trying to get a handle on the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=340.24s)]
*  details for all of those, but right now there is a rally going on with thousands of people peacefully [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  calling for the release of David Huerta, calling for ICE to stop what they're doing, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=351.76s)]
*  and for the federal troops, essentially that power to be returned to the governor. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=357.2s)]
*  Isn't that very atypical and unusually as well? Isn't there always task force, local and federal, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=361.76s)]
*  working together hand in hand? Because local, you know the community better than the feds often do. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=368.48s)]
*  Feds often have a unique resource set. So whether it's going after the criminals and the bad guys, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=378.08s)]
*  these operations seem to be targeting hard working immigrant populations. But when it actually came [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  to how do we actually get bad guys out, it was always working with local, state, and federal in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=392.24s)]
*  task force. But here it just seems to be federal, not communicating at all, and not going after [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  criminals, going after people working in factories and people who are in home depots and going into [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=406.08s)]
*  neighborhoods and schools and courtrooms. How do you go from a drug den, that's what you're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=413.2s)]
*  saying you're going to do, to a home depot and chasing day laborers, people who look for work [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  every single day? What is the reason for that? What is the reason for going into some of the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  factories and plants? These are working people struggling to try to get ends to meet in our very, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=430.96s)]
*  very expensive city. And so I just don't understand the logic in that. It is not keeping our city safe. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=437.92s)]
*  If you want to go back in time, where was LA on Thursday? Fine, peaceful, nothing was happening. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=445.6s)]
*  The minute ICE rolled into town, that's when the chaos started. And then add to that, bringing in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=452.0s)]
*  federal troops. And so it's just felt like it was a kind of a deliberate situation. We pleaded and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=457.6s)]
*  said, there is no reason to do this right now. The violence that broke out several nights ago, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  it was with a group that was around 100 people. We are a city of 3.8 million. Our police force can [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=472.48s)]
*  take care of 100 people and not all of them were committing violence. 20 of them were arrested. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=480.56s)]
*  So if that was the pretense for bringing in the National Guard, it was a false pretense, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=486.64s)]
*  which makes us feel like it's like deliberate chaos. And that maybe we are a test case as to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  how this is going to go down in cities. It's so unfortunate. We're getting ready to welcome the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=498.0s)]
*  World Cup in a year. And if anything, we need efforts to show unity in our city, not to try to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=502.64s)]
*  divide us. And now we have vandalism that has to be dealt with. And then there is the collapsing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=510.4s)]
*  of what a few individuals did to the broader immigrant rights movement that have been [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=516.56s)]
*  conducting peaceful, lawful protests for decades in the city. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=521.84s)]
*  So what would be your message right now if Trump and Hegseth and Homan are watching this? What's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  your message to them right now? Stop. Stop. Stop the raids. This is not helping our city. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=534.64s)]
*  It is creating chaos. Withdraw the troops. Give the power back to the governor. And please, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=543.52s)]
*  there is no reason for Marines. There is no reason for this. There is nothing happening here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=551.52s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass, thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me on. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=557.36s)]
*  Everybody hit subscribe. Let's get to five million subscribers. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhoSTsvhPw&t=560.8s)]
