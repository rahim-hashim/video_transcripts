**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA)
*  State regime media known as Fox was quite literally stunned into silence as Donald Trump said [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=0.0s)]
*  For them what was the inexplicable? I'll show you that in a moment also while Donald Trump was [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=8.42s)]
*  Engaged in this bizarre cabinet meeting press conference thing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=15.32s)]
*  Fox had enough and they just had to cut away from it as Donald Trump was starting to talk about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=20.34s)]
*  The gold painting that he uses on the ceiling. It was so utterly bizarre [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=27.46s)]
*  Let me show you the moment where Fox was first stunned into silence here their chief [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  Propagandist Jesse Waters was talking about Trump's disastrous cabinet meeting before the press watch what goes down here play this clip [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=38.46s)]
*  If it has nothing to do with peace or money [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=46.14s)]
*  47 doesn't want to hear about it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=48.82s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=51.42s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years you're asking we have Texas we have this we have all of the things [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=54.18s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy this creep? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  That is unbelievable [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=65.78s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe you're asking a question at Epstein at a time like this where we're having some of the greatest [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=67.78s)]
*  Success and and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. It just seems [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=74.14s)]
*  like a desecration [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, that was interesting well that was interesting Jesse and let me show you the moment that Fox just cut away [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=81.82s)]
*  From the Trump cabinet meeting press conference just because they knew how utterly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Embarrassing and humiliating this was to MAGA to Fox to Trump to the United States [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  But he humiliates us each and every day here play this clip. We also painted the Roman eyes [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  color beige color [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=106.3s)]
*  And it's been it's been really something the only question is will I go live [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=108.46s)]
*  The corners you could maybe tell me my cabinet could take about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=113.86s)]
*  You see the you see the top line moldings [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  And the only question is do you go live it because you can't paint it if you paint it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=122.62s)]
*  It won't look good because they've never found a paint that looks like all you see that in the overall [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=127.0s)]
*  All right, we're about half past the hour here. This is America reports [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=132.22s)]
*  We have been watching this cabinet meeting happening live then Fox brought on this podcaster [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=135.73999999999998s)]
*  Patrick bet David and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=141.98s)]

*  Like what the hell is Trump doing out there? You can see that they're struggling [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=147.42s)]
*  They're like, you know, he's trying to coach Trump also with Jesse Waters [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  He's like why would you say you had the list if you didn't have the list? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=156.26s)]
*  What are you doing here play this clip you talking about Epstein? Yeah [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=160.14s)]
*  I think good to be back on with you buddy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=163.54s)]
*  But this is what I will tell you the number one trending hashtag right now on X is Epstein [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=166.38s)]
*  Two million people have tweeted with the topic of Epstein number two is Nicki Minaj at a hundred thousand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=171.46s)]
*  Comey's at forty two and a half thousand. There is a reason why people are asking about this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=177.44s)]
*  This is by far and I'm a supporter three times. I voted for this man [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=181.62s)]
*  This is by far the biggest fumble of the administration [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=185.3s)]
*  They've had thus far and here's the reason why if you remember pre the president winning [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=189.06s)]
*  He had a conversation with Fox News the great Rachel Campos Duffy and she asked mr. President [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  911 yes, John F. Kennedy. Yes [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=200.62s)]
*  Epstein ah, he didn't say yes. He was a little bit hesitant of bringing that information out [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=203.9s)]
*  Why so why does his leadership team go out there? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=209.58s)]
*  Like we have this information and we're gonna release this and cash and let me tell you what we have with Pam Bondi at a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=213.78s)]
*  State of Florida. She knew everything about Bondi about Epstein. Why are you fumbling this? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=219.46s)]
*  Why are you not having an emergency meeting together to conversate and say hey [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=224.5s)]
*  We're gonna be on the same page with messaging on this. All you have to do is send a message to everybody say guys [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=228.26s)]
*  Let's have a let's have a conference call [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=233.46s)]
*  Here's what we're gonna be saying about this because this was a very important issue [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=234.78s)]
*  But Fox then had to get its bearings they are state regime media, right? So they had to figure out [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=238.86s)]
*  Oh crap. What are we going to do? How do we create a distraction with Donald Trump? What's what do we do? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=244.06s)]
*  What do we do? What do we do? Got it. Let's go after [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=249.86s)]
*  Comey former FBI director and Brennan former CIA director and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=253.38s)]
*  they bring on Trump's chief propagandist Caroline Levitt press secretary and she's like truth [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=259.38s)]
*  Transparency we're going after former CIA director Brennan and Comey for Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=266.84s)]
*  Here play this clip. There's obviously something to that. We just heard [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  Caroline on though if you saw the top of the show [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=278.56s)]
*  It looks like there has been an investigation opened up into James Comey and John Brennan [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=280.68s)]
*  Possibly lying to Congress in a conspiracy over the Russia hoax [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=287.44s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=293.08s)]
*  Well, I just heard that news at the top of your show and I'm glad to hear it because both of these disgraceful [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Individuals turned against our Constitution in our country and I'm sure they did in fact lie to Congress and it's up to the Department of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=301.44s)]
*  Justice to investigate that and to prosecute them if they did and what we have seen is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=308.3s)]
*  corruption at the highest levels against President Trump the deep state threw everything at him to prevent him from coming back to this big beautiful [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=313.52s)]
*  White house behind me and he prevailed and the truth must come out and this administration is totally committed to transparency and to justice and to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=320.86s)]
*  Accountability and we must have a rule of law in this country. We can't be a nation without law and order [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  That's what the president believes in and I'm glad to see the Department of Justice is opening up this investigation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=334.18s)]
*  All right. I mean, isn't it just so obvious what they're doing? Okay [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=338.7s)]
*  Now the FBI is figuring this one out there. They're going to criminally prosecute Comey and Brennan now [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=342.98s)]
*  To distract from the Epstein files [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=350.82s)]
*  by the way [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=352.9s)]
*  That should be part of the defense of Comey and Brennan to and just try to get in discovery all the dirt on the Epstein [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=353.66s)]
*  files as well [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=360.74s)]
*  Then they bring on Fox [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=362.46s)]
*  MAGA Republican senator from Alabama Katie Britt and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=364.62s)]
*  Katie Britt goes, you know, the real issue here is that the Democrats they have Trump derangement syndrome [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=369.14s)]
*  How dare they talk about the cuts to the National Weather Service to the key [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=376.7s)]
*  meteorologist coordinator positions and six other vacancies in Texas [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=383.06s)]
*  How dare they bring up it must be Trump derangement syndrome to bring up that FEMA? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=388.58s)]
*  Is going to be eliminated by the Trump regime and that Doge made all of these cuts and that the local officials in Texas [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=394.82s)]
*  Said they did not get the alerts. Let's play this clip [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=402.0s)]
*  You know and I think it shows that Trump derangement syndrome is real [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=405.3s)]
*  When you take such a tragedy and a terrible moment like this and you don't want to do anything [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=409.82s)]
*  But turn it into something for your own political gain [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=415.62s)]
*  You know, my daughter is at camp right now [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=419.5s)]
*  And I know that there are parents out there that are counting down the days until they pick up their child and there are also [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=421.5s)]
*  Parents that are clinging to the fact that they have another day with their child and we've got to be human beings [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=427.86s)]
*  Kelly Anne not everything has to be political [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=433.44s)]
*  There will be time for us to figure out how we can do better and do more and prevent these tragedies in the future [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=436.28s)]
*  And what they don't realize is their toxicity is not normal [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=441.62s)]
*  And it is not something that we should tolerate and the United States of America [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=446.52s)]
*  It's so unbecoming we gotta come together officials definitely now is the time. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. It is Trump derangements [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Range what are you talking y'all have Trump derangement syndrome on Fox your utterly deranged that any [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=459.32s)]
*  propaganda he spews you amplify then you have [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=465.44s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congressmember Stube and Fox's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=469.44s)]
*  Cheryl Cassone and here they talk about the work requirements for Medicaid and they're like a lot of people work 80 hours a week [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  And then Stubbe's like I'd want to cut more [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=481.36s)]
*  I wish we could have cut more government services right now. You think you want to cut more government services? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=484.52s)]
*  These people are diabolical here play this clip [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  But in within Medicaid and I think this is where the messaging has been interesting [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  It's 80 hours a month that you have to show that you worked 80 hours a month a lot of people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=496.96s)]
*  congressmen work 80 hours a week [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=503.68s)]

*  Decisions those cuts at the same time you've got reconciliation coming you've got [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=509.34s)]
*  Recisions coming so aren't there more places that we can cut and where would you be willing to make cuts in? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=514.22s)]
*  Spending so that we don't completely blow out the debt in this country, which is already sitting at 37 trillion [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=520.22s)]
*  Yeah, I support massive cuts to a whole entirety of government programs that we have but unfortunately we have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, but we have moderates in our party that obviously can't support the type of cuts that somebody like me would support [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=535.62s)]
*  Then you have MAGA Republican Congressmember Jim Jordan [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=542.26s)]
*  Here's what he has to say play this clip if there's an able-bodied adult out there now who is in our welfare system [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  Guess what that person's going to have to work that is fair to taxpayers. That's good for our economy [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  Maybe most importantly that's actually good for that recipient for that individual gets them on a better path to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=556.82s)]
*  Attaining work and skills and everything else to get to a better position in life that is far from immoral [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=561.94s)]
*  But we I always say David [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=567.1800000000001s)]
*  We know this is a good bill because the left hates it and the left hates it because it does not empower government [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=569.26s)]
*  And then they go into just talking about Superman here. They are saying Superman movie super woke as [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=575.58s)]

*  This is the launch of the whole new DC Universe that he's commandeering [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=589.38s)]
*  Why he would go and blow it up in the 11th hour after? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=593.26s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing and publicity talking about kindness and look at Superman the red cape [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=597.06s)]
*  He's got a dog [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=602.98s)]
*  This is a lousy way to go and the question is did he do this to try to cover up the coming financial? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=604.14s)]
*  Disaster to make it look like it was a political reaction. We'll see I just did a whole podcast on this [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=611.78s)]
*  It's a very interesting question [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=617.06s)]
*  But this might go the way of Snow White and they bring on this other guy right here who says yes [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=618.98s)]
*  Superman is too woke. They're taking over Superman here play this clip. I wanted to go see Superman [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=624.06s)]
*  I'm not that interested in going to see it now [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=629.5s)]
*  there's lots of ways that I can spend money and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=631.66s)]
*  This moron with his take and deciding to say Superman was super political and it was about an immigration story [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=634.06s)]
*  I think he's alienated half the country and I think he made a really poor decision [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=641.06s)]
*  And they continue to do that here play this clip [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=645.1s)]
*  I also read that the guy who stars as Superman had the audacity to say instead of fighting for truth liberty and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=647.34s)]
*  Great values in America. He refused to say the last part [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=654.9s)]
*  I mean who did these guys think the consuming public is and wants to see these woke movies? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=657.62s)]
*  And then finally they have to go and attack [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=662.98s)]
*  Transgender athletes so they bring on Riley Gaines and pretend that she was going to win a gold medal [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=665.86s)]
*  What she was never going to win a gold medal [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  At all, but here let's play this clip gain Gaines tied for fifth [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=675.22s)]
*  But they pretend that she was gonna win a gold medal here play this clip [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=680.02s)]

*  Not to hold a gold medal because you were in first place, but to be told that you tied [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=688.86s)]
*  You'll have to settle for it. Just with that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=693.98s)]
*  delineation on it what happens now [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=696.94s)]
*  We will see hopefully this sets a precedent for more institutions at every single level again [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=699.1s)]
*  Not just colleges. Hopefully now we see governors follow suit. Of course governor Newsom governor Mills of Maine [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=704.74s)]
*  They have been terrible on this issue. Hopefully even the Olympics like hopefully this transcends beyond [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=710.74s)]
*  Just college institutions the NCAA of course they continue to remain totally weak need and spineless and morally bankrupt on this issue [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=716.3s)]
*  Again an institution governed by cowards so hopefully now this is the example that needed to be set for more [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=725.1s)]
*  Institutions to be willing to do the right thing again [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=731.3000000000001s)]

*  Of course under the Biden administration actually dating back to the Obama administration [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=740.5s)]
*  This federal law was hijacked to mean something that of course it was not intended to mean so praise God [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=744.82s)]
*  Of course it was not intended to mean so praise God and I really mean that I do praise God for [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD-RwORGYA&t=750.5s)]
