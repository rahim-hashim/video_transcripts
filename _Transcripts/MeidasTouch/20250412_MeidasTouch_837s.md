# Trump RUSHES to Leave DC as he TANKS EVERYTHING
**MeidasTouch:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk)
*  So, Wall Street fund managers are now telling the press that they believe Trump is actually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=0.0s)]
*  clinically insane. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=6.68s)]
*  The New Republic highlighted recent statements made from fund managers who think that Trump's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=8.56s)]
*  behavior indicates that he might have lost his marbles. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=13.84s)]
*  You think you're just coming around to realize that now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=18.44s)]
*  He's someone who continued to brag about cognitive exams and man, person, woman, elephant, or [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=22.32s)]
*  whatever the heck the exam was. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=28.96s)]
*  By the way, he was doing that again yesterday when he went on Air Force One, which by the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=30.12s)]
*  way he struggled to get into Air Force One. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=35.88s)]
*  We've got the video here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  He didn't know how to put the umbrella back to its original position and he couldn't get [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=39.88s)]
*  into the door and he got stuck pulling the umbrella through a door where the umbrella [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=46.36s)]
*  didn't fit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=51.92s)]
*  Then he goes on Air Force One. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=52.92s)]
*  I don't want to play a lot of Trump clips on this video, so indulge me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=54.88s)]
*  I'll tell you what he said. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=58.72s)]
*  He goes, I just took a cognitive exam. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=60.72s)]
*  It was a hard one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=63.36s)]
*  I took the exam. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=65.08s)]
*  I did well on it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=66.24s)]
*  I did great. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=67.56s)]
*  I did better than Biden on the cognitive exam. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=68.56s)]
*  This is what he was talking about last night. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=71.52s)]
*  So, he goes on Air Force One, flies to Mar-a-Lago on the taxpayer dime, charging we the people, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=73.52s)]
*  the taxpayer, literally tens of millions of dollars so he could go back to Florida and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=80.84s)]
*  vacation again over and over again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  Every weekend, this is what he does. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, before he left, as the bond markets are continuing to implode, as the dollars crashing, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=91.92s)]
*  as the 10 and 30-year Treasury yields are going to levels that they should never be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  at at all, showing stability as they continue to go up, reflecting great instability with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  the American markets, as mortgage rates are now over 7%, as the euro and yen are rising, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=113.48s)]
*  as I mentioned, the dollars crashing, as China and their foreign ministry in Xi Jinping have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=120.76s)]
*  made statements that they're never going to bow or submit to Donald Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=126.0s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump was doing yesterday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=131.44s)]
*  This was one of the big things he did. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=133.18s)]
*  He took the portrait of President Obama in the White House, and he got rid of it, and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=136.04s)]
*  he replaced it with an image of him in the Butler, Pennsylvania incident with his fist [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=143.2s)]
*  up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=151.56s)]
*  Tacky, disgusting, despicable, weird, you name it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=152.56s)]
*  And then the sources close to Donald Trump were telling CNN that Donald Trump's been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  telling people at Mar-a-Lago while he's vacationing and partying that he loves this shit, he says. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=163.76s)]
*  He's loving all of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  The chaos, the suffering, he says that he loves this shit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=172.68s)]
*  You take a look also, by the way, at Doge and its quote unquote attack on government [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=179.72s)]
*  waste fraud and abuse. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=188.68s)]
*  Right now there's more federal spending under the Trump regime by significant amounts than [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=191.56s)]
*  under former President Biden. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=199.36s)]
*  Doge is a complete and utter failure. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=201.12s)]
*  And when Donald Trump says, I'm loving this ass, what are you loving, Donald? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=205.0s)]
*  You're loving that the people are suffering. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=209.8s)]
*  You're loving that our former allies that you've alienated are working together, isolating [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=211.52s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  They're coordinating strategies to dump American treasury bonds, to cheapen it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=219.84s)]
*  They're coordinating strategies to retaliate against you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=227.48s)]
*  And you're too busy talking about cognitive exams and how you love this S word and vacationing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=231.82s)]
*  while attacking our allies that you have no clue or former allies, I guess, based on what [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=238.2s)]
*  you've done, that you have no clue what's going on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=243.16s)]
*  What is it that you love, Donald? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=245.68s)]
*  Do you love the fact that the Atlanta Federal Reserve is now predicting a GDP contraction [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=247.36s)]
*  in the first quarter of somewhere between 2.5 percent, so negative 2.5 percent GDP and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  three negative 3.7 GDP, when if you literally did nothing and let former President Biden's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=261.18s)]
*  economy go on auto drive, it would have been 3.9 percent or even 4 percent growth. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=267.82s)]
*  What are you loving, Donald? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=273.9s)]
*  That there was a helicopter crash in the Hudson, another incident involving the Department [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=274.9s)]
*  of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=281.58s)]
*  Two planes clipped each other's wings at Reagan National Airport. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=285.5s)]
*  There was another plane crash in Palm Beach. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=289.94s)]
*  I mean, is this what you're loving? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=292.78s)]
*  You're loving this S word. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=297.7s)]
*  Consumer confidence is falling to its lowest point in 45 years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=299.7s)]
*  The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey shows Americans across all political [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=304.88s)]
*  cohorts believing that there's going to be 6.7 percent inflation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=311.18s)]
*  As I mentioned before, mortgage rates are surging. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=318.7s)]
*  The Social Security Administration, in addition to gutting 90 percent of its regional staff, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=321.98s)]
*  is now going to be shifting all of its public communication to Elon Musk's social media [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=329.9s)]
*  app X. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=336.02s)]
*  So if you're on social security and you need to know about your benefits or have issues, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=337.7s)]
*  you can't go to a regional office. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=344.5s)]
*  You have to go on Elon Musk's social media app. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=346.26s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=350.9s)]
*  And by the way, are you all hearing about that on corporate news? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=351.9s)]
*  Or are they too busy still talking about former President Biden's cognitive, whatever they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=355.02s)]
*  want to talk about? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  I remember under former President Biden, there were 16.2 million jobs created. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=361.38s)]
*  There was record low unemployment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=365.86s)]
*  I remember there were 40,000 infrastructure projects that GDP in the United States beat [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=372.3s)]
*  I remember the Wall Street Journal under former President Biden said the United States economy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=373.54s)]
*  was the envy of the world and that other economic analysts said America had a Goldilocks economy [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  that was being passed from former President Biden to Donald Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=384.42s)]
*  But you called him sleepy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=387.98s)]
*  He was sleepy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=389.54s)]
*  He's too boring for you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=390.54s)]
*  Well, are you not entertained now? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=391.54s)]
*  Is this the type of entertainment you wanted as the Trump regime crashes our economy? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=393.14s)]
*  As Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackstone said, we're already in a recession, he believes, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  and the CEOs he talks to already believe we're in a recession. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=404.46s)]
*  As JP Morgan and MetLife and others believe there's a 60, 70% chance of inflation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=408.26s)]
*  Let me just take a look at what the White House claims that their major victories were [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=414.34s)]
*  this week. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=418.3s)]
*  This is what the White House posted. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=419.3s)]
*  These are their big victories. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=420.58s)]
*  LA Dodgers and racing champions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  That was your big victory. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=424.9s)]
*  LA Dodgers and racing champions. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=426.06s)]
*  Bilateral with Netanyahu. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=429.85999999999996s)]
*  Bilateral what? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  You met with Netanyahu again as you talked about ethnic cleansing of Gaza, taking the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  people and moving them to other countries. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=439.06s)]
*  That's your celebration. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  China has now retaliated and imposed 125% tariffs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=444.1s)]
*  Shut the China market down so no US products could get in. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=452.1s)]
*  It's economically non-feasible both ways. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  That's the win here as China mocks you, as China's foreign ministry spokesperson calls [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=460.5s)]
*  you a barbarian. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  That's the win. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=468.26000000000005s)]
*  By the way, China's cutting deals with Europe. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=469.26000000000005s)]
*  China Electric Vehicle is going to go to Europe. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  They're working on free trade deals together. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=473.18s)]
*  Australian beef in higher demand than ever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=475.34s)]
*  People just aren't buying from the US. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=479.82s)]
*  Europe tourism to the United States going down significantly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=482.3s)]
*  Canadians boycotting the United States. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=485.82s)]
*  By the way, Canadians on Vancouver Islands were out for the resistance tour, packed house [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=488.3s)]
*  in the Vancouver Islands watching Charlie Angus give a speech. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=495.65999999999997s)]

*  The crowd at Vancouver Islands. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=502.86s)]

*  So Donald Trump went on the plane. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=556.46s)]
*  Air Force One to go back on his vacation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=560.58s)]
*  I don't want to play the clips. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=564.22s)]
*  I just don't want to hear his voice this morning. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=565.66s)]
*  So let me tell you what he said. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=567.42s)]
*  I took a physical exam. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=569.5s)]
*  I took a cognitive exam. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=570.86s)]
*  I aced the exam. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  He said the bond market is going good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=573.74s)]
*  It had a little moment, but I solved the problem very quickly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=576.0600000000001s)]
*  I am very good at that stuff. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=579.86s)]
*  It's actually up at 20 basis points since he claims he solved that stuff. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=581.98s)]
*  It's higher, meaning it's worse right now, the treasury yields than when he said, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=585.86s)]
*  I solved it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=590.58s)]
*  I don't think he knows what a treasury yield is, a 10 year or 30 year. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=591.62s)]
*  I don't think he knows how the treasury bonds are auctioned. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=595.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't think he understands how any of this works. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=598.7s)]
*  Then he goes, we're always going to be the currency choice. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=601.5400000000001s)]
*  As long as you have somebody smart, the dollar is going to be the currency [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=604.74s)]
*  When people understand what you're doing, I think the dollar will go way up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=608.62s)]
*  It's going to be stronger than ever. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=612.5s)]
*  Currently, the dollar is crashing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=614.26s)]
*  Then Donald Trump just says a bunch of odd stuff. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=616.5s)]
*  We're making a lot of money as a country now. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=619.34s)]
*  We were losing billions of dollars a day now, and we're making billions of dollars a day. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=621.38s)]
*  We brought it down to 10 percent. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=626.38s)]
*  So that made it a little bit less. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=628.3s)]
*  I did that because I wanted to be fair to other countries. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  A reporter asks him, can you tell us about the test? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=634.18s)]
*  Did you take the man woman person camera TV test? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=637.18s)]
*  And then Donald Trump can't recall what his cognitive test was. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=640.42s)]
*  He goes, it was a pretty well known test. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is, I got it right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=645.9s)]
*  I didn't play the clips. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=648.98s)]
*  OK, our our RFK junior gave a speech in front of the FDA on Friday. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  And during the speech in front of the FDA, it was a 40 minute tirade [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=657.38s)]
*  during which he made disability slurs calling people the R word. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=661.58s)]
*  He spread deep state conspiracy theories and accusations that agency [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=666.94s)]
*  employees were becoming sock puppets for industries that they regulate. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=671.7800000000001s)]
*  Also, the Trump administration has ordered the State Department [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=676.9000000000001s)]
*  employees to report on any instances of coworkers displaying anti-Christian bias [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=679.7s)]
*  as part of its effort to implement a sweeping new order [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=685.4200000000001s)]
*  on supporting employees of Christian faith. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  That's what they're focused on here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=692.1400000000001s)]
*  And let's just take a look at what Republicans in the Senate [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=695.82s)]
*  voted against as part of what's called a vote arama. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=699.62s)]
*  This is where Democrats introduced amendments to the budget [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=702.86s)]
*  bill on the budget plan, and this is what Republicans voted against. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=707.02s)]
*  They rejected ruling out tax breaks to the wealthy, tax relief for the middle class, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=711.54s)]
*  reversing Doge cuts to the Social Security administration, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=716.86s)]
*  rescinding tariffs that increase the cost of groceries, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=720.5s)]
*  preventing Medicaid cuts, preventing increasing drug costs for elderly [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=723.78s)]
*  and disabled Medicare enrollees, prohibiting using commercial messaging [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=727.74s)]
*  apps to talk about military operations. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=731.62s)]
*  So literally, the Democrats said, we want to introduce an amendment [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=734.0999999999999s)]
*  blocking the Trump regime from using text messages to talk about war plans. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=738.78s)]
*  And the Republicans in the Senate said, nope, we're OK with that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  We are good with that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=748.3s)]
*  As Don Winslow says, CNN is not telling you, but you could say any corporate news. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=751.14s)]
*  They're not telling you that the US dollar is crashing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=755.58s)]
*  The euro is rising. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=758.22s)]
*  US consumer confidence has plummeted to the lowest point since 1952. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=759.7800000000001s)]
*  And US retailers are suspending orders and halting shipments [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=764.9000000000001s)]
*  as the global supply chain grinds to a near halt. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=768.86s)]
*  We're telling you about it on the Midas Touch Network, because those are the facts. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=774.34s)]
*  I think when you watch the Midas Touch Network, when the news happens, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHN0uksKtBk&t=777.94s)]
