# WOW! Fox News GIVES UP on Trump in SHOCKING TWIST
**MeidasTouch:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc)
*  Wow, Fox, which I call state regime media, almost seemed to be giving up on Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday, at least on some of their shows. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  They were calling the guy out. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=9.6s)]
*  They were showing their new Fox poll, which shows that in the first 100 days, Donald Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  has the worst approval of any modern president by far. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=16.8s)]
*  For example, in the first 100 days, former President Biden's approval was 54%. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=21.2s)]
*  Former President Obama's was 62%. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=26.88s)]
*  Even Donald Trump in his first administration was 45%. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=30.0s)]
*  Now Trump too, the new Trump regime, Trump's approval at 44% right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=34.2s)]
*  Fox ran that graphic over and over again throughout the day on most of their shows. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  More on that in a moment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=46.76s)]
*  They also ran the following graphic as well from its poll, that 56% of Americans disapprove [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=48.08s)]
*  of Donald Trump's job performance on the economy, only 38% approve. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=56.16s)]
*  Fox was running that graphic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=61.72s)]
*  Then you had Bret Baer, one of the Fox hosts, talk about how Donald Trump's approval in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=63.8s)]
*  100 days is awful based on the new Fox polling. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=69.88s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=75.4s)]
*  The president talking tariffs in the economy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=76.4s)]
*  If you look at our new Fox News poll at 100 days job approval compared to other presidents, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=78.44s)]
*  Here you see the president at 44% and you see his first term at 45% at this mark, the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=84.36s)]
*  100 day mark. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=91.52s)]
*  We have other new polls that are revealing some concerns about the economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=92.96s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=97.08s)]
*  And Fox didn't stop there with talking about Trump's horrible, horrific handling of the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=98.34s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=105.16s)]
*  They also talked about how Donald Trump continues to attack President Zelensky of Ukraine and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=106.24s)]
*  Donald Trump goes out of his way to try to compliment and suck up to Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=113.12s)]
*  Here you've got Bret Baer again talking about it over here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=123.4s)]
*  He was the president, not the White House press secretary, but saying that they're disappointed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=124.4s)]
*  in Zelensky, but they're moving forward. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, he keeps pounding Zelensky and saying it's harder to deal with him than [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=132.24s)]
*  it is with Putin. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=138.96s)]
*  Putin so far, as I can tell, hasn't agreed to much of anything, except yes, he'd love [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=140.44s)]
*  to annex Crimea, which is part of the proposal that's before him now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=144.6s)]
*  That's no concession. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=150.0s)]
*  That's just that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=151.0s)]
*  All that is is taking a gain. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=152.84s)]
*  Zelensky resists that because Crimea up until the Russians invaded it 10 years or so ago [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=157.0s)]
*  was part of Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=165.72s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure what the president is talking about when he says that Zelensky [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=167.66s)]
*  has been more difficult to deal with than Putin. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=175.54s)]
*  You know, there have been a series of ceasefire proposals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=178.18s)]
*  Putin either hasn't agreed to them or has immediately broken them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=181.7s)]
*  I'm not sure what concessions Putin will ever be willing to make, but he certainly hadn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=185.42s)]
*  made very many so far. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we will see. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=192.94s)]
*  The president is meeting with enough. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=194.46s)]
*  And look, even throughout the day yesterday, Donald Trump continuing to attack Ukraine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=195.9s)]
*  This as Kiev was targeted again by ballistic missiles from Vladimir Putin after Donald [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump continued to harass and threaten Ukraine and thank Vladimir Putin for commissioning [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=209.38s)]
*  a ugly painting of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  Steve Witkop, Donald Trump's special envoy to Russia, said this is such an honorable [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=223.18s)]
*  gift that Putin gave to Donald Trump. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  So then Trump makes posts like this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=229.82s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky is boasting on the front page of the Wall Street Journal [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=232.1s)]
*  that Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=237.34s)]
*  There's nothing to talk about here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  This statement is very harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia and that Crimea was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=243.3s)]
*  lost years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=248.04s)]
*  Let me just stop reading it right there because you know where the rest of this is going. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=249.04s)]
*  And let me call Donald Trump out as a terrorist himself, as a felon, as a sexual abuser, as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  someone who aids and abets Vladimir Putin's genocide. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=259.54s)]
*  And Donald Trump is a sick and disgusting person. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, they were calling him out on Fox yesterday a little bit too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=266.82s)]
*  So here was Robert Wolf on Fox talking about being in finance for 40 years and never seeing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=271.46s)]
*  the economy be mishandled. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=280.46s)]
*  And this way in his entire career, play this clip. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=282.38s)]
*  I don't know, Robert, some of the people we talked to say incompetence, probably the wrong [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=285.18s)]
*  word unclear might be a better word. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=288.54s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=291.42s)]
*  I mean, this I've been in finance for 40 years. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=292.42s)]
*  This is probably the biggest manufactured crisis I've seen with a bunch of unforced [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=296.1s)]
*  errors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=300.54s)]
*  The execution of Liberation Day was pathetic. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=301.54s)]
*  I mean, you have Kevin Hassett in 2019. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=303.94s)]
*  Be very clear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=307.76s)]
*  Trade wars are bad. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=308.76s)]
*  Tariffs are tax. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=310.14s)]
*  Steve Moore, another Trump advisor. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=311.5s)]
*  Trade wars are bad. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=313.7s)]
*  Tariffs are tax. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=314.7s)]
*  The GOP. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=315.7s)]
*  Tariffs are tax. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=316.7s)]
*  Trade wars are bad. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=318.18s)]
*  We're for free trade. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=319.18s)]
*  You saw April until, for the most part, the president blinked both on Fed Chairman Powell, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=320.66s)]
*  which I'm glad, as well as the China trade war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=326.86s)]
*  Then the markets recovered somewhat, but it was on for the worst month since 1932. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=329.74s)]
*  And that's not even considering what's going on with bonds, where there has been an incredible [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=335.9s)]
*  lack of confidence in the U.S. dollar and U.S. investments. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=340.22s)]
*  So I've- [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=344.1s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=345.1s)]
*  Coffee isn't just a drink. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=346.1s)]
*  It's a ritual. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=347.1s)]
*  A lifeline. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=348.1s)]
*  The bridge between half asleep and ready to conquer the day. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=349.1s)]
*  And if it's that essential, why settle for anything less than extraordinary? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=350.66s)]
*  That's where trade comes in. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  Listen, you know I take my coffee seriously. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  And every single bag of coffee I've received from trade has been next level. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=358.94000000000005s)]
*  Trade is not just a subscription. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  It's like having a personal barista who actually knows what you like. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  You just take their quiz and in under a minute, they'll match you with your [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  perfect coffee. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=370.18s)]
*  And if your first bag isn't a hit, they'll replace it for free until they get it right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=371.18s)]
*  I love that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=375.46s)]
*  Trade is the number one U.S. coffee destination, working with over 50 of the best roasters [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=376.66s)]
*  around the country. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=380.1s)]
*  You're getting top quality coffee, roasted to order, while supporting local businesses. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=381.56s)]
*  That's a win-win. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=386.62s)]
*  Just this week, I got a bag of Ethiopian coffee from a roaster called Necessary Coffee that's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=388.22s)]
*  based in Pennsylvania, and it was just incredible. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=392.2s)]
*  And I love that I never have to worry about taking an emergency run to the grocery store [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=395.38s)]
*  for a mediocre overpriced bag because trade delivers top-notch coffee straight to my door. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  Right now, trade is exclusively offering our listeners 50% off your one-month trial at [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=405.5s)]

*  Trust me, you will never go back to grocery store coffee. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=423.06s)]
*  Now, I explained that some of these shows were being honest on Fox. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=426.46s)]
*  Just some. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=432.38s)]
*  And you saw those there, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=433.38s)]
*  You had Brit Hume and Brit Baer and you had Robert Wolf. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=435.86s)]
*  I want to highlight it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=440.7s)]
*  It was accurate. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=441.7s)]
*  But then, of course, you had Jesse Waters seeing that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=442.7s)]
*  And Jesse Waters, vile, disgusting propagandist that he is. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=445.54s)]
*  He looks like the guy on Hunger Games, like the host in the Hunger Games. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=451.12s)]
*  And Jesse Waters starts – this is what they talk about – departing doge, how Elon Musk [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=455.2s)]
*  calls it quits after left-wing terror campaign. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=461.84s)]
*  Watch what Jesse Waters says here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=466.47999999999996s)]

*  The contribution that he made is not how much he saved the taxpayers. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=470.2s)]
*  It's exposing how much Democrats stole from the taxpayers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  It's so easy. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  It's only three steps, Greg. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=479.08s)]
*  You are a Democrat. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=480.86s)]
*  You know a Democrat in DC and you get them to send you money. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=482.5s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=486.82s)]
*  And someone got a million dollars to clean up a beach. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=488.62s)]
*  Now, if you get a DEI or DUI or DWI, they will make you clean up the beach. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  What are they even talking about? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  Left-wing terror campaign? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=504.06s)]

*  The doge promised that it was going to save $2 trillion. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=509.02s)]
*  Okay, now they're saying maybe $150 billion, but it seems more like nothing at all. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=512.9s)]
*  What they were all about was not making the government more efficient or cutting federal [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=520.66s)]
*  costs because federal spending, Jesse, is actually up significantly right now, significantly [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=525.02s)]
*  higher. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  What they did was focusing on stealing the people's data. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  That's what it was really about. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=537.18s)]
*  Taking your social security, your medical records and all that stuff. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=538.94s)]

*  What many of these snobs don't get is that we're watching them take an IQ test every [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=555.58s)]
*  day. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=561.0600000000001s)]

*  Then they bring on Maga Mike Johnson, of course, Will Kane, who's trying to be Jesse [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=565.86s)]
*  Waters and Tucker Carlson. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=571.34s)]

*  Play this clip. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, they're not going to pay $5,000 for baby boom, just like no tax on [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=622.06s)]
*  Social Security, no tax on overtime. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=651.1s)]
*  All this is BS. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=653.62s)]
*  Remember the Doge rebate checks? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=654.62s)]
*  Doge rebate checks, we're going to give you $5,000 if you respond to our poll. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=658.22s)]
*  They're not giving Doge rebate checks. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=662.62s)]
*  They're con artists. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=665.22s)]
*  They're Ponzi schemers. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=666.22s)]
*  Okay, they're scammers. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=667.22s)]
*  Trump's a fraud. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=668.22s)]
*  He's a criminal. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=669.22s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=670.22s)]
*  The guy lies about everything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=671.9s)]
*  Remember the other day Trump was like, the price of eggs is down 94%. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=674.08s)]
*  I got it down 94%. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=679.34s)]
*  Uh, bull BS. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=681.4200000000001s)]
*  The price of eggs is up. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=683.58s)]
*  It's higher than ever right now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=685.22s)]
*  They lie and lie and lie. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=686.9s)]
*  By the way, it should be noted when Trump talks about the baby boom, where'd they get [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=688.98s)]
*  this idea from? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=692.38s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=693.38s)]
*  Hitler establishes the Mother Cross to encourage German women to procreate. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=694.38s)]
*  On December 16, 1938, Adolf Hitler institutes the Mother Cross to encourage women of pure [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  German origin to increase the size of their families and grow the population of the Third [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=705.18s)]
*  Reich. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=710.54s)]
*  They would get these medals and money. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=711.54s)]
*  Where do you think some of these ideas come from? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=713.38s)]
*  So then you had on Fox also, um, Caroline Levitt, she was on in the morning and she [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=716.22s)]
*  was asked a very simple question about, uh, is Donald Trump going to remove these tariffs [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=722.54s)]
*  on China? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  And she's like, let me be very clear. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=730.02s)]
*  There's going to be no unilateral reduction in the tariffs. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=732.44s)]
*  And this was after Trump the day before that said that there would be. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  To me, if you look at the sequence of clips that I just showed you, Caroline Levitt said [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=738.8800000000001s)]
*  that this morning and I think Fox was like, all right, release the poll. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  And Murdoch was like, release the poll. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=748.2s)]
*  We got to shut this guy down right now on some of our shows. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=750.5200000000001s)]
*  We can't stop Jesse Waters and, and, uh, and Hannity and all of them here playing this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=753.72s)]
*  clip. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  Caroline, let's see if we can break a little news here. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  What's the timetable for the reduction in the tariffs against China? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=761.6s)]
*  The president was ambiguous about it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=766.52s)]
*  Scott Besson seemed to suggest it wouldn't happen until negotiations are at least underway. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  There will be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  The president has made it clear. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=777.76s)]
*  China needs to make a deal with the United States of America and we are optimistic that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=779.24s)]
*  will happen. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=783.4s)]
*  And when that continues, it will be up to the president what the tariff rate on China [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=784.52s)]
*  will be. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=789.7s)]
*  But we certainly need to see a reduction in tariffs and non-monetary tariff barriers from [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=790.7s)]
*  China as well. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=795.5400000000001s)]
*  And we also need to continue seeing these companies abroad return their manufacturing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=796.5400000000001s)]
*  to the United States of America so we can shore up these critical supply chains. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=801.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=805.62s)]
*  Well, Marcus seemed to be watching every bit of it well off their highs of the session, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=806.62s)]
*  but still up about 500 points today. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, on the morning show here, you just see how just like just mean and vile [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=811.82s)]
*  they are. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=816.7s)]
*  Just watch what they were saying here about Whoopi Goldberg. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=817.7s)]
*  Thank God she didn't do IVF because just listen to it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=820.7800000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to repeat what they're saying here. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=824.82s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=826.5s)]
*  Are you excited about it? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=827.5s)]
*  I mean, Julie, she's such a lovely person. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=829.5s)]
*  Isn't she lovely? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=833.38s)]
*  She really is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=834.38s)]
*  It's such a shame she's not a mother. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=835.38s)]
*  I feel like she would have been the best role model. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=838.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank God she did not do IVF because I don't think she'd actually find somebody to actually [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  physically impregnate her is what I'm trying to get out there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=843.0200000000001s)]
*  But anyway, no, as far. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=845.5s)]
*  Yes, so vile and disgusting. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=847.18s)]
*  And then finally, I'm not going to show clips of Hannity because it's just the most ridiculous [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  episode. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=852.7399999999999s)]
*  No mention of the poll, no mention of the tariffs. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=853.7399999999999s)]
*  This is what they were showing on Hannity. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=856.66s)]
*  These were the topics. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=858.8599999999999s)]
*  Dems in disarray, ring camera robbery, Shaq's new porta potty, Florida man offers booze [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=860.3399999999999s)]
*  to cops during car chase. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=871.02s)]
*  Those were the big issues that they were tackling on Hannity. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=873.74s)]
*  You see why I call them state regime media. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=878.22s)]
*  But still, throughout the day, some of their hosts calling them out, showing the polls, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=880.78s)]

*  In general, do you think imposing tariffs or fees on products imported from other countries [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=894.5s)]
*  makes the products you buy more expensive, less expensive, or does it make a difference? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe7ECVWirc&t=898.94s)]
