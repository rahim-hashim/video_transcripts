# Trump BLOWS UP in DISASTER Presser with African PREZ
**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs)
*  Donald Trump just held a disastrous press conference with five African leaders at the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump turned to the president of Liberia and said very impressive that you speak English [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=5.2s)]
*  Liberia's official language is English here play this clip. Well, thank you. It's such good English. It's beautiful [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=11.84s)]
*  Where did you learn to speak so beautifully? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=18.8s)]
*  Where were you educated? Where? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=21.28s)]
*  Is that in Liberia? Yes, that's very interesting. It's beautiful language [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=23.92s)]
*  So I have people at this table can't speak nearly as well [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=29.68s)]
*  Then Donald Trump is asked if he's learned how it was that weapon shipments stopped to Ukraine and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=34.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says yeah [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=41.44s)]
*  I still don't know how that happened and then the reporter says don't you think that's something you should know and Donald Trump's like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=42.88s)]
*  I know everything you just said you didn't know though here play this clip [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=49.72s)]
*  Yeah, please sir yesterday [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=55.0s)]
*  You said that you were not sure who ordered the munitions [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=57.64s)]
*  Halted to ukraine. Have you since been able to figure that out? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, I haven't thought about it because we're looking at ukraine right now and munitions, but I have no I have not gone into it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=64.6s)]
*  What does it say that such a big decision could be made inside your government without you knowing? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=71.8s)]
*  Uh, I would know if a decision was made I will know [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=76.2s)]
*  I'll be the first to know in fact most likely i'd give the order, but I haven't done that yet [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=80.36s)]
*  Yeah, please then donald trump is asked how he calculates tariffs watch what he says here play this clip [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=85.16s)]
*  Sir, can you explain how you calculated your latest round of tariffs? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=92.2s)]
*  Was there a formula that was used and do you expect any of these countries to face tariffs as well? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=102.52s)]
*  Formula was a formula based on common sense based on deficits [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=103.8s)]
*  based on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  How we've been treated over the years [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=110.36s)]
*  And based on raw numbers and we're going to have a couple of more coming out today brazil as an example has been [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  Not good to us not good at all [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to be releasing a brazil number. I think later on this afternoon or tomorrow morning [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  But they're based on very uh, very substantial facts and also past history [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  You look at the past history. We've been [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=134.68s)]
*  we never had anybody in the white house that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=138.28s)]
*  understood the numbers or [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=141.0s)]
*  We're into it like I have you know, we've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs hundreds of billions [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=143.4s)]
*  And we haven't even yet. It's even dumber than you thought he goes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  I do it based on common sense and deficits then donald trump says that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Gasoline prices are down to a dollar 99 in many states, which is false here play this clip [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=160.68s)]
*  Things are more costly. No, they're much less costly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=167.24s)]
*  Yesterday a dollar 99 a gallon is two states three states [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=171.08s)]
*  We're selling gasoline at a dollar 99. You haven't seen that for a long time [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=175.8s)]
*  And I brought costs way down [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=180.44s)]
*  Just about every cost I can't think of a cost that went up but just about every cost [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=183.0s)]
*  So what they do is they lie. I mean they take ads [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=187.0s)]
*  uh, they'd almost think that the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=190.68s)]
*  the advertising station would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=194.36s)]
*  Stop it because they know it's wrong. It's such an it's such a lie. All you can do is say it's a lie [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=196.76s)]
*  And explain it. I guess I have the ability to explain it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  At conferences like this. So I like to donald trump is asked about the chinese buying farms near military installations in the united states [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=206.04s)]
*  Donald trump seems unfazed and he goes I like xi jing ping. We love xi jing ping in america [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Here play this clip also announced this week that they are going to start limiting chinese ownership of american [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=220.12s)]
*  farmland [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=226.18s)]
*  Why do you think that the chinese have been buying up all this farmland in our country so close to military installations? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=227.0s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into that. I have a very good relationship with president chi [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna see and i'm gonna you know, they're gonna be making a recommendation to me, but we have a very good relationship as you know, we [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  they're paying a lot of tariffs to the united states now and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=247.48s)]
*  So i'm not gonna get into that right now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=253.16s)]
*  Then donald trump says that he loves that churches can now endorse political candidates [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=256.04s)]
*  And still keep their tax exemptions and still be tax-free or play this clip. Do you support that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=262.12s)]
*  I love the fact that churches can endorse [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=269.08s)]
*  a political candidate, I think so because [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  we have a lot of respect for the people that lead the church for the pastors and the ministers and the rabbis and the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  All different leaders all different religions and people respect those people and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=283.88s)]
*  I think there's nothing wrong. You know, it was a very big penalty if that took place [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=288.52s)]
*  Just a little while ago. They had a thing called the johnson act [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=293.4s)]
*  And it was a very big penalty. I think it's great if a pastor minister priest rabbi [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  And we could very much go into your your religion by the way [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=304.44s)]
*  Which is something that people have a great respect for throughout the world [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=307.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a new settlement that the irs entered into saying churches [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  We will still consider you to be non-profits if you endorse political candidates [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=316.68s)]
*  Donald trump then starts getting very bored about this press conference and you'll see him gesturing to one of the african leaders [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=321.23999999999995s)]
*  Hey, can you wrap this up here? Watch this? Let's play resources [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=327.88s)]
*  In our seawaters, so lots of fishing and whatnot. I don't want to spend too much time on this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  But I appreciate it very much [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=341.55999999999995s)]
*  I appreciate it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=344.12s)]
*  Maybe we're gonna have to go a little bit quicker than this because we have a whole schedule [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=345.88s)]
*  um, if I could just say it's you know your name and your [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=350.68s)]
*  Country would be great. Thank you, please [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=355.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. Mr. President trump [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=358.36s)]
*  Then fox state regime media asks him a question. When was the last time you went sunbathing? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=361.32s)]
*  Very odd. Let's play it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=367.88s)]
*  And now a few weeks after the strikes that you ordered on the nuclear facilities in iran [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  There is an iranian facility [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  An iranian official who says you president trump have done something that he can no longer sunbathe in mar-a-lago [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  As you lie there with your stomach to the sun a small drone might hit you in the navel. It's very simple [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you think that's a real threat? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  And when is the last time you went sunbathing? Anyway, i've been a long time. It's been a long time [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=393.88s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe I was [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  Around seven or so [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=401.24s)]
*  I'm not too big into it [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=403.4s)]
*  uh [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=405.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's a threat [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=407.08s)]
*  I'm not sure it's a threat actually but it perhaps it is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=409.32s)]
*  Life moves fast and sometimes you just need a way to relax recharge or stay focused without [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=413.88s)]
*  Overcomplicating things and that's where via comes in i've been using via's effect-based gummies, especially the ones for sleep their dreams sleep gummies [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=417.94s)]

*  so perhaps [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=568.68s)]
*  An investment could be made in a golf course in senegal [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=571.0s)]
*  It would just be six hours by flight from new york [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  from miami from europe [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=579.88s)]

*  He's a little older than he as you saw before donald trump's basically saying his decisions on tariffing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=603.24s)]
*  Is if he knows the country or if he likes the country so that's what's going on in the white house [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnbTfo8pBZs&t=608.6800000000001s)]
