# Red States SUFFER Massive CRISIS from Trump DECISION
**MeidasTouch:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU)
*  If we can send missiles overseas, why can't we send money to help us? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=0.0s)]
*  Arkansas now Kentucky got hit this past weekend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=7.26s)]
*  My opinion is your priority is your home. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=12.86s)]
*  Your priority is your home and the money should be reaching your states. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=17.3s)]
*  But Donald Trump's FEMA is MIA and that shouldn't surprise us because Donald [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=21.12s)]
*  Trump has stated and his Homeland Security Secretary, Cosplayer Dog [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=26.86s)]
*  Killer, Kristi Noem has also stated that they want to get rid of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=31.14s)]
*  I mean, they've made those statements. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=35.66s)]
*  They say they want to push it to the states that are not capable alone [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=37.22s)]
*  of handling these things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  And we've seen with over 900 tornadoes that have touched down this year so far [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=42.18s)]
*  and disastrous storms in areas like Kentucky and Illinois and Missouri, in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=46.96s)]
*  Arkansas, in Mississippi and elsewhere. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=52.46s)]
*  FEMA has been slow to react if it's reacted at all. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=55.42s)]
*  Also, you have FEMA rejecting supplemental assistance requests or just delaying it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  in states like Georgia and North Carolina across these areas that have been really, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=64.06s)]
*  really harmed significantly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=70.94s)]
*  Now, let me just show you this longer clip that CBS put together of other people who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=72.62s)]
*  have been impacted in very bad ways by the Trump regime. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=77.14s)]
*  We're talking about red states, purple state, blue state. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=80.82s)]
*  Doesn't matter where Americans and FEMA should be working for us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=83.22s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=86.3s)]
*  My double wide mobile home was located right here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=87.58s)]
*  68 days ago, a deadly tornado in Tylertown, Mississippi leveled Dorothy Yarbrough's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  home. Riding out a tornado in a double wide seems like a very scary experience. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=97.5s)]
*  It was. It was. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=103.02s)]
*  It happened so fast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=104.38s)]
*  But the response from the federal disaster agency, FEMA, has been slow. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=106.66s)]
*  Typically, when a tornado destroys a town, someone like Yarbrough applies for federal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=111.42s)]
*  assistance. The president signs the declaration and FEMA spends money to recover and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=115.86s)]
*  rebuild. Yarbrough has applied. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=120.86s)]
*  But after 10 weeks, she's got nothing but a huge pile of debris and this camper. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=123.34s)]
*  So this was donated by a church. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=129.06s)]
*  This was a FEMA, right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=130.82s)]
*  Right. No, no, no, not FEMA. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=132.5s)]
*  Across the country, governors have 21 requests into the White House for emergency or [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=134.3s)]
*  disaster declarations to have been denied. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=139.3s)]
*  The other 19, including Mississippi, are waiting for a decision. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=142.9s)]
*  President Trump says he wants to get rid of FEMA altogether. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=147.58s)]
*  Somebody's going to have to help. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=150.82s)]
*  Patsy Pittman's family has owned this property for generations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=152.78s)]
*  She and her husband repaired their damaged home and farm buildings with their own [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  personal insurance money and most of their life savings. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=160.66s)]
*  Forty grand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  We've applied. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  That's the last we've heard. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=168.34s)]
*  But they say the president hasn't signed it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=170.18s)]
*  So how does that make you feel? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=172.34s)]
*  A little disappointed. If we can send missiles overseas, why can't we send money to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=175.9s)]
*  help? We're also seeing headlines like this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=182.1s)]
*  Trump undermined Biden's FEMA in North Carolina. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=184.98s)]
*  Now the cleaning now the cleanup is lagging under Trump's watch after Trump spread all [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=188.7s)]
*  of these lies about what FEMA was doing in North Carolina and saying that they were [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=194.26s)]
*  prioritizing immigrants over people, which was which was false. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=198.54s)]
*  And we're seeing this play out across the country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=202.22s)]
*  Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders can't get much more Trump than that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=204.06s)]
*  She was getting her aid delayed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=208.42s)]
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congress member Jared Moskowitz, who led emergency [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  management in Florida before becoming a member of Congress. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=214.26s)]
*  This is an issue near and dear to your heart. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=218.18s)]
*  And you're out there raising these calls each and every day. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=221.1s)]
*  First talk to us about what's happening, how big of a disaster this is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=225.18s)]
*  What are you doing, Congressman? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=229.06s)]
*  No, first of all, Ben, thanks for for talking about this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=231.06s)]
*  This is a this is a big a big deal, especially as we're getting into hurricane season. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=235.3s)]
*  I mean, literally, we're we're at the end of May. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=239.78s)]
*  And let me start at the beginning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=243.22s)]
*  OK, the president was right that FEMA needed reform. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=244.98s)]
*  He was right about that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  The emergency management industry has known FEMA's needed reforms. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=249.82s)]
*  One of those reforms is that you got to get FEMA out of Homeland Security. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=253.5s)]
*  Homeland has bastardized FEMA. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=257.34s)]
*  They have used FEMA in ways that FEMA was not built for. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=259.54s)]
*  And they turned FEMA into the grant agency for every other department in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=262.78s)]
*  Homeland, which got FEMA off its core mission of response and recovery. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=266.38s)]
*  And that's been well known. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=270.9s)]
*  You talk to former administrators of FEMA, Democrat and Republican, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=271.9s)]
*  and they've they've all said the same thing, which is why I have a bill with [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=275.62s)]
*  Byron Donalds, of all people, you know, who's running for governor endorsed by [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=279.9s)]
*  President Trump to get FEMA out of Homeland. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  But that's not what they've done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=289.02s)]
*  What they've done and what the secretary has done. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=290.62s)]
*  And I don't know if the secretary has even done this with the White House, even [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=294.02s)]
*  knowing, OK, the secretary has taken something that needed help. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  And she has completely broken it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=301.46s)]
*  I believe what you're going to see is this summer, the secretary has turned [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=303.66s)]
*  FEMA into the Newark airport. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=307.18s)]
*  I think you're going to see it fail in ways we don't yet know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=308.94s)]
*  And it's just amazing to watch Arkansas, who had met the thresholds that are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=313.42s)]
*  mandated in the Stafford Act, not get their declaration. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=317.66s)]
*  And let me explain in emergency management time, it's all about time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=320.74s)]
*  It's all about going quickly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  In fact, that's what the president said. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=325.9s)]
*  He wanted to speed up FEMA, yet the secretary has made everything slower. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=327.26s)]
*  Nothing is more efficient. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=331.66s)]
*  Remember Doge Department of Government efficiency, what they they forgot the E piece [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=332.74s)]
*  efficiency. FEMA is not more efficient. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=336.94s)]
*  No, it's not more efficient. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=338.94s)]
*  In fact, it's not a single thing that is working more efficiently. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=339.86s)]
*  But FEMA has lost 30 percent of its workforce. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  OK, a lot of these were senior people knew what they were doing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=346.54s)]
*  You got regional offices that are empty and they're delaying declarations. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=348.9s)]
*  Delaying declarations means that states aren't going to spend money, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=352.38s)]
*  Locals aren't going to spend money. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=357.06s)]
*  These are fiscally constrained areas. They don't have it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=358.18s)]
*  I mean, I said to the speaker and Steve Scalise and others like you guys know this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=360.46000000000004s)]
*  without FEMA, if Louisiana gets hit by, you know, a category four storm, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=364.82s)]
*  OK, from the Gulf, you know, your state goes bankrupt without FEMA. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  Mississippi goes bankrupt. Alabama goes bankrupt. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=373.18s)]
*  So when you're watching those people who are saying they're not getting any help, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=375.26s)]
*  it's because the states don't have the money, the cities don't have the money [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  and they rely on FEMA. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=381.74s)]
*  And they're supposed to be getting what's called individual assistance, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=383.26s)]
*  which we want to try to speed up the process. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=386.18s)]
*  That's what they're waiting on. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=387.86s)]
*  And because there's no declaration, they can't get individual assistance. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=389.18s)]
*  So there will be towns that will look like that, who won't get rebuilt without FEMA. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=393.18s)]
*  And when we get into hurricane season, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  usually they get what's called a pre landfall declaration. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=400.34s)]
*  As the storm's approaching, because we know, you know, how the track is going to be. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=403.26s)]
*  You know, we give them a pre landfall deck, which allows you to move ice, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  water, power generation, life, health, safety, swift water rescue, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=409.94s)]
*  and lets the state and locals know that they're going to get reimbursed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  These local governments won't spend any money in Florida. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=416.86s)]
*  And look, Florida has the best emergency management department in the country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=420.3s)]
*  But we rely on the money, right, so that we can go move our logistics. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=423.86s)]
*  And if the state is worried that that money is not coming, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=428.54s)]
*  if they're worried that is going to get delayed, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=431.3s)]
*  you're going to have state legislatures weighing in on what can we do that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=433.38s)]
*  Can we do this? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=436.62s)]
*  And so this is not what many people thought when we heard about reform [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=437.62s)]
*  and making FEMA faster and shrinking the department to get it to focus on response recovery. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  What the secretary has done right now has been totally counterintuitive. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=449.42s)]
*  And she's exposed the president, by the way, if I'm being honest. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  She has exposed the president because we're going to get into the hurricane season [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=457.7s)]
*  and we're going to see FEMA fail in ways that we've never seen before. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=461.5s)]
*  And the president's going to be like, well, we knew it needed reform. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=465.86s)]
*  Yeah, but but the secretary, Mr. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=469.18s)]
*  President, has broken FEMA in ways that it's not it's going to expose you in red states. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=471.58s)]
*  If if if they don't get lucky, we don't get lucky in hurricane season. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=476.38s)]
*  And we have a bad hurricane season. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  Right. We get bad storms. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=481.86s)]
*  We get an F4 tornado in one of these red states. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=482.94s)]
*  I mean, the president's going to have a department that doesn't work. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=485.5s)]
*  Congressman, is the former head of emergency management in Florida [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  dealing with disaster relief at a state level? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  You know this more than anyone. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=495.26s)]
*  So when you said that FEMA is going to fail in a way that we've never seen before [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=496.58s)]
*  based on the way the Trump administration has been handling things so far. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=501.58s)]
*  Does that mean mass casualty events that can otherwise be avoided? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=506.94s)]
*  Listen, the FEMA's main force, right, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=512.22s)]
*  is to support the operations locally down at the state and down at the local level. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=516.78s)]
*  It's always been their deal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=521.22s)]
*  Getting the resources down. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=522.8199999999999s)]
*  We want to speed that up. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=524.26s)]
*  The faster you get resources down, the faster the folks on the ground, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=525.38s)]
*  the state and local can move. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=528.58s)]
*  So if FEMA is delaying stuff and by the way, all grants right now are paused in FEMA. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=530.18s)]
*  I don't know if you know this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=534.34s)]
*  They've paused all grants, things that were, you know, have previous declarations, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=535.34s)]
*  previous presidential declarations. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=540.1s)]
*  And the secretary has no authority in the Stafford Act or in the Homeland [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=541.7s)]
*  and the Homeland Act, which was passed after Katrina. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=546.34s)]
*  There's no authority to put blanket pauses on these things. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=548.98s)]
*  In fact, they contemplated that in these acts and it's strictly prohibited. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=552.86s)]
*  There are there are criteria which you could do that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=557.22s)]
*  But and you're supposed to be given due process to appeal that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=559.58s)]
*  None of that is going on. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=562.1800000000001s)]
*  And so, yes, Ben, at the end of the day, if these resources come slower, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  it could mean more deaths and it could mean towns, you know, are going to suffer. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=568.42s)]
*  People are going to suffer. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=573.02s)]
*  And it's not going to save any money in in in the long term, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=573.9s)]
*  because the longer it takes for resources to down, I think the more expensive [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=577.86s)]
*  it gets to do to do some of these things. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=581.26s)]
*  You know, it's a segue into talking about this disaster budget [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=584.54s)]
*  because FEMA was completely under attack in this disaster budget bill. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=587.86s)]
*  There's a lot of things that we've highlighted here that makes this bill very dangerous. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=593.26s)]
*  It's attack on Medicaid. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=598.58s)]
*  It's attack on Medicare. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=600.22s)]
*  We're learning, although silencers and suppressors, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=602.18s)]
*  they were the big winners, along with the billionaires. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=605.42s)]
*  And the tanning beds. Come on. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=607.66s)]
*  They had a tax cut in there for tanning beds, finally taking us into the golden age. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=609.18s)]
*  You you have unique observational perspectives on on on all sorts of things, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=614.66s)]
*  but particularly this budget bill reflecting on that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  You and I are recording this on on a Friday. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=624.78s)]
*  This video is going to drop on Friday. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  What do you make of it? Where do we go from here? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=628.78s)]
*  So, I mean, listen, they did everything they said they were going to do. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=631.8599999999999s)]
*  We told you that they were going to do it and they were saying, oh, no, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=635.9799999999999s)]
*  we're not going to cut Medicaid. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=638.38s)]
*  The president said, oh, no, we're not going to touch Medicaid. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=640.06s)]
*  Well, they did. The House cut it by seven hundred billion dollars. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=642.18s)]
*  It's going to take money away from the most needy, the bottom 10 percent [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=646.02s)]
*  and give it to the top 10 percent in the tax cuts. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=649.18s)]
*  Don't listen to me. That's literally what the CBO has said. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=651.18s)]
*  That is what third party folks have said. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=654.38s)]
*  And even worse, it's going to add all of this right to the debt. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=657.54s)]
*  Three trillion dollars a year. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=661.78s)]
*  You got Thomas Massey saying that he thinks it's going to add 20 trillion [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=664.26s)]
*  dollars to the debt. Right. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=669.38s)]
*  You're seeing the bond market going down, which is how we float our economy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=671.26s)]
*  When we sell those bonds to other countries, the yields on that are going up [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  because no one wants to buy by our debt. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=678.5400000000001s)]
*  The stock market is down today because you guess what? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=680.82s)]
*  We're back to tariffs. Thought the president learned his lesson. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=682.7s)]
*  Didn't you know now we're raising tariffs on the EU and on Apple again. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=684.86s)]
*  And so, you know, this this is, you know, unfortunately, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  what happens when you lose elections. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=694.6600000000001s)]
*  Elections have consequences and they have all of government. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=698.26s)]
*  They have no breaks. They're drunk with power. OK. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=701.62s)]
*  And the only way we're going to send a message to them, the only way [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=705.22s)]
*  we're going to be able to put brakes on this and stop this is to make Hakeem [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  Jeffries speaker. President Trump is fully in charge. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=711.22s)]
*  There is no bot. They all caved. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=714.58s)]
*  Everybody caved as we knew they would. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=716.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, nobody stood up on the principles that they've yelled [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=719.02s)]
*  and screamed when Democrats are in charge. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=721.62s)]
*  Those are all gone out the window. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=723.38s)]
*  They have no more principles. They can't talk to us about that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=724.98s)]
*  They can't talk to us about spending money. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=727.9s)]
*  They did everything they claim they didn't want to do. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=729.6999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's going to hurt. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=733.66s)]
*  It's going to hurt a lot of people at at, you know, in the in the bottom [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=735.66s)]
*  in the bottom 10 percent. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=740.42s)]
*  You know, look, I think that what's going on with FEMA [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=741.9s)]
*  is unfortunately going to be the biggest story of this summer [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=745.1s)]
*  and in hurricane season. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=749.34s)]
*  So I'm using this platform every day, just warning as many people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  as we can get ahead in front of. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=755.4599999999999s)]
*  I know this is not the sexiest issue to talk about right now. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=757.34s)]
*  But I think what happens in emergency management, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=761.3s)]
*  We don't talk about it when you don't need it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=763.86s)]
*  And then as soon as you need it, that's when we get the function. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=765.98s)]
*  But if it doesn't work and that's why I'm raising the alarm now, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=768.38s)]
*  I'm not raising the alarm then because, look, you're talking to a Democrat. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=771.78s)]
*  Who worked for a Republican in Florida. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=774.94s)]
*  Emergency management supposed to be nonpartisan because it affects Americans. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=776.94s)]
*  OK. And so, look, I'm out there, you know, trying to put this [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=780.34s)]
*  on the radar of the president and the people in the West Wing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=785.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to sound the alarm now while we have a couple of months, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=787.74s)]
*  maybe to kind of fix some of the damage that has gone on in homeland. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=790.98s)]
*  But if we get into September with the way things are now, OK, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=795.02s)]
*  and we don't get lucky and we do have storms and Noah is calling [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=798.86s)]
*  for an above average hurricane season, 60 percent chance of that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=803.22s)]
*  I am deeply concerned about what is going to go on in some of these states. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=806.38s)]
*  We're seeing it already with these tornadoes. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=811.58s)]
*  I'm real I'm real worried. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, the only thing I can do is tell people what I know, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=817.4200000000001s)]
*  how I look at it. I'm trying to do it in a nonpartisan way. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=822.58s)]
*  I'm trying to just give them the truth. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=825.38s)]
*  OK, that's why I'm saying, yes, the president was right that FEMA needed reform. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=827.38s)]
*  But that's not what the secretary has done. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=831.94s)]
*  What the secretary has done is she took something that needed help [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=834.14s)]
*  and she has just destroyed it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=836.62s)]
*  Congress member Musk, which thanks for joining us as always. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=839.26s)]
*  Thank you. Everybody hit subscribe. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC4bkwC13eU&t=842.1s)]
