# FURIOUS Meteorologist RIPS Trump TO PIECES ON LIVE TV
**MeidasTouch:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0)
*  This is one of the things we've been warning about folks, a very well-known meteorologist from South [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida, John Morales, live on air, making a stunning admission that based on the cuts to FEMA, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=6.8s)]
*  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, the National Weather Services, John Morales, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=15.36s)]
*  this well-known meteorologist from South Florida says, I don't think I'm going to be able to predict [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=22.0s)]
*  where these hurricanes are going this hurricane season the way I've done in past years. I know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=27.84s)]
*  you all rely on me, but I got to be real with the viewers. He said this on live TV. I want you to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=33.84s)]
*  watch this clip. First, he's showing a clip earlier when a horrible hurricane hit and he was having [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=39.68s)]
*  to make these predictions. Then he'll talk about while he's live, what's happening as we now enter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  hurricane season. Play this clip. Listen, I've been on this since eight o'clock this morning [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=51.2s)]
*  on social media and there is a lot of anxiety out there because you don't see it turning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  When is it going to turn? John, it's not turning. It's coming straight to us. It's going to turn. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=69.12s)]
*  All right. The turn was never forecast to be on Sunday. The turn isn't even on Monday morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=76.39999999999999s)]
*  The turn will come Monday afternoon, Monday evening into Tuesday. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=83.6s)]
*  Remember that? That was about six years ago. That was Hurricane Dorian as it was absolutely [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=90.24s)]
*  devastating. The Northwest Bahamas as a category five sat over that region for two days. It was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  headed straight west. Lots of people in Florida were concerned the hurricane was heading here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=101.44s)]
*  As you've grown accustomed to my presentations over my 34 years in South Florida newscasts, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=108.0s)]
*  confidently, I went on TV and I told you it's going to turn. You don't need to worry. It is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=115.84s)]
*  going to turn. I am here to tell you that I am not sure I can do that this year [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=121.84s)]
*  because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general. I could talk about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=127.68s)]
*  that for a long, long time and how that is affecting the US leadership in science over [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=137.6s)]
*  many years and how we're losing that leadership. This is a multi-generational impact on science in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=143.6s)]
*  this country. Specifically, let's talk about the federal government cuts to the National Weather [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=151.52s)]
*  Service and to NOAA. Did you know that Central and South Florida National Weather Service offices [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=157.76s)]
*  are currently basically 20 to 40 percent understaffed? From Tampa to Key West, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=162.96s)]
*  including the Miami office, 20 to 40 percent understaffed. This type of staffing shortage [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=169.52s)]
*  is having impacts across the nation because there's been a nearly 20 percent reduction in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=176.0s)]
*  weather balloon launches that carry those radio songs. What we're starting to see [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=180.72s)]
*  is that the quality of the forecast is becoming degraded. Not only is the quality of the forecast [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=186.64s)]
*  becoming degraded, the new interim leader of FEMA has zero experience in FEMA. One of his first days [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=193.92s)]
*  on the job with a group meeting, he said that he didn't even know what hurricane season was. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=204.64s)]
*  And he claims it was a joke, but he said he didn't know what hurricane season was. Here, watch this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=211.76s)]
*  Well, but I also spoke with some FEMA personnel who were inside that briefing yesterday who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  couldn't really tell if David Richardson, FEMA's new acting administrator, was kidding around or [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  if he was essentially saying that he was pretty unfamiliar with hurricane season before taking [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  this new job last month. You may remember when he was put in charge last month by Homeland Security [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=232.0s)]
*  Secretary Kristi Noem, he had no prior experience managing natural disaster. He comes from the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=237.44s)]
*  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office at DHS, and this has just raised red flags among [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=243.92s)]
*  FEMA staff about the lack of experience at the top as hurricane season is now underway and who's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=250.32s)]
*  going to be making those decisions with what information when lives need to be saved and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=256.24s)]
*  potentially communities need to be preserved during these catastrophic storms? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=261.6s)]
*  You know, they go back to that again. It was just a joke when he said it. You're joking about not [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  knowing hurricane season as the head of FEMA when it can lead to the death of thousands of lives. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=272.56s)]
*  I want to call in Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of Semaphore, also the host of the podcast, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=278.88s)]
*  Mixed Signals that everybody should check out. Hey, Ben, at Semaphore, you guys cover a lot, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=285.68s)]
*  and one of the things I like about Semaphore is you focus on the kind of basic competency of like, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=292.24s)]
*  it's not a partisan thing. It's not this is a Democrat or Republican thing. Is this thing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=300.0s)]
*  working or is this thing breaking? Is it dysfunctional and how do we fix it? And we don't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=306.72s)]
*  have to just talk about FEMA, but talk to us generally about the coverage that you've seen [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=312.88s)]
*  where just the basics, this shouldn't be a Democrat, Republican, the basics of government [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  are not working. You know, this is, I mean, I've been covering and managing reporters, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=325.12s)]
*  covering Trump since the first term. And this really is in a way the big challenge of covering [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=330.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is he will, is he says he makes promises and predictions. A lot of the people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=335.28s)]
*  around him are as much media figures as they are more professional media figures, rather than [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=340.88s)]
*  experienced managers of government agencies and say things that might lead you to believe that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  they're going to do something crazy. And I mean, I guess my own view is like that forecaster sounds [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=354.4s)]
*  like he is worried for a really good reason, but you can really lose your mind trying to predict [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=359.76s)]
*  which of the things Trump says he will follow through on, which are real, which are rhetoric, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=366.32s)]
*  which are trolling, you know, they've, and I think that sounds like, I think people inside [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=370.88s)]
*  FEMA, inside other agencies are like, are obviously very concerned. I mean, I think from a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=375.92s)]
*  journalistic perspective, like our goal is just to like keep an eye on like, you know, let's see [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=379.84s)]
*  what happens, you know, is that, is that white meteorologist can be able to, is he going to get [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  that data or not? There's a, I think you can really lose your mind trying to predict what is real and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=388.24s)]
*  what is not real in this environment. And that's, and that's where, you know, they throw everything [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=394.48s)]
*  at you. And, you know, it's, you take a, you take a look at, you know, even like SignalGate. I mean, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=400.88s)]
*  just think about your past coverage, you know, when you were leading newsrooms, even before [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=408.24s)]
*  semaphore, I mean, something like SignalGate classified information on a software text messaging [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  app where it really shouldn't be used. It's clearly classified information. I mean, you know, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=422.08s)]
*  anybody who sees classification goes, they're literally talking about war plans. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=428.4s)]
*  I feel like this is the wrong place for me to like defend the Trump administration, but let me, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=432.96s)]
*  I might be on the wrong show, but, but let me like give you, I think like here is where they are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=436.88s)]
*  coming from, which is that if you were like in the defense department today, or you would be, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=441.44s)]
*  you would say, oh my God, like the classification systems built in the, you know, over the, that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  have grown up over the last 20, you know, 20, 30, 40 years, make it impossible to function and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=451.6s)]
*  conceal all sorts of information that actually shouldn't be secret. And, and, and, and there's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=456.88s)]
*  an impulse, which actually I think is not crazy to say, listen, we got to sweep aside all this [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  government bureaucracy. We've got to operate in a modern way. I think the challenge of the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=467.04s)]
*  Trump administration is all they have is that impulse and they, and they are sweeping. And, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=472.0s)]
*  you know, I don't think the idea that government officials can communicate on Signal, like that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=475.6s)]
*  makes sense to me. It's very secure. Probably makes more sense than everybody having to go [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=479.04s)]
*  into some kind of windowless basement whenever they want to have a conversation. On the other hand, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=482.48s)]
*  does not seem like they put more than one second of thought into how they were going to do it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=488.16s)]
*  And then pretty soon the Atlantic reporter is on, is on the chat. And I think there's this disdain [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  for the way government has operated that is partly ideological, it's partly a reality. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  I think a lot of people have cut, who have contact with the federal government in various ways or [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=502.48s)]
*  work in it. It drives them insane, the bureaucracy. But there is like a real impulse to throw the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=505.68s)]
*  baby out with the bathwater that you're seeing. And I think things like FEMA and hurricane season, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=510.64s)]
*  the administration is going from being able to complain about bureaucracy or whatever it's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=515.12s)]
*  complaining about to having to suddenly own the consequences of screwing up really important [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=520.08s)]
*  government services. I think we're just starting to see where that's real and where that's not. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=524.4s)]
*  Well, look, you could take the Signal example. I'm all for there being more efficiency, but then [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=528.72s)]
*  I'm not for the lying though. When they say what happened there is not classified, why wouldn't if [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  they were okay with it? And they truly thought this was a more efficient way that foreign nations [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  couldn't hack into. Why wouldn't they say, look, it was unfortunate that we invited the Atlantic [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=549.68s)]
*  editor in chief in, but this was classified information. He shouldn't have seen it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  That was the mistake versus they attacked the Atlantic editor in chief and said he's a whack [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=561.44s)]
*  job or he's a leftist radical. And they blame him for inviting him into the chat. They claim [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  the information is not classified. And then to me, how do we address the problem if there's no [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=574.08s)]
*  accountability? And it seems that all they want to do when they create these disasters is then shift [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=581.2s)]
*  the accountability somewhere else. I don't know if you agree. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=586.8800000000001s)]
*  For sure. And then they invite the editor to the White House to interview Trump. I think that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=588.96s)]
*  the performative theatrical, they live moment to moment and so Trump lives moment to moment [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=594.4s)]
*  in the headlines, in social media and so much of what is happening in the White House is totally [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=600.64s)]
*  reactive. It's actually very much like it was in the first term, just gangs who can't shoot straight [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=607.12s)]
*  stuff where they're kind of moving from crisis to crisis. And I just think that like what you're [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=613.04s)]
*  talking about the hurricanes and what I think we're going to see over the next six months is [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=618.8s)]
*  in that context, are there going to be huge screw ups in the basic function of government [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=622.88s)]
*  to get people hurt? And I think that is the actual test. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, we are what, 130 plus days in now. At what point do they say we're in charge and stop blaming [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=631.28s)]
*  a former administration? I mean, when you take over as the editor in chief, you know, of a [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=640.56s)]
*  of Midas Touch, I'll blame you for blaming you forever. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  At some point, though, again, to me, we have to just talk about basic leadership. At what point [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=652.0s)]
*  does the buck stop with you and that these are your policies and you take accountability? And [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=658.4s)]
*  what message does it send just in general to other people out there if you're not [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=663.6s)]
*  standing on business, if you're not standing up for what you believe in and everything is [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  a whine and a complaint and a blame? I mean, this is what did not work for [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump in the first term, right? Like, I think it was very much like the first term. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=679.28s)]
*  You know, he sought to blame everything that went wrong on his predecessor, Barack Obama. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  And it didn't work politically, like people didn't really buy it. And he got wiped out in [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=688.88s)]
*  the midterms and lost reelection. So I think I don't think I don't think it's effective. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=692.56s)]
*  I think people basically are going to judge the government whether it works, not on whether they [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=698.8s)]
*  can find somebody to blame. And honestly, even for stuff, this is I mean, just even for stuff [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=701.92s)]
*  like the like, you know, that isn't that may there are forces outside their control. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=706.8s)]
*  When you're president of the United States, you get blamed for everything. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=711.1199999999999s)]
*  You know, and you go to the fact that politics in general is probably not the most [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=714.16s)]
*  popular thing, except when it hurts people and then people pay attention to it. People [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=720.48s)]
*  generally are skeptical of the government. So I believe I'm sure you believe in the government [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=725.84s)]
*  should operate more efficiently. It should be tailored to 2025 versus 1955. But what happens [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  when we now see Elon Musk leave, and we know that actually federal spending is higher month over [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  month now than it was under former President Biden, what happens when we see based on all the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=748.72s)]
*  nonpartisan projections that the deficit is going to be increasing significantly under this budget [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  bill, and that there was no waste or fraud or really anything that was uncovered? At what point, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=761.44s)]
*  though, can we use the language and I speak to you editorially here, that this was just a complete [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=768.48s)]
*  and utter failure? Who writes that chapter? And I mean, you know, I think I think I'm trying to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=774.48s)]
*  remember where I saw this the other day, but apparently Trump was asking people, Trump was [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=781.44s)]
*  asking people of Doge, Hey, was this was this bullshit? So, I mean, you know, I think I think [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=785.44s)]
*  I think obviously Doge didn't work. And then and yeah, I think, you know, it's, I think it's easy [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=791.52s)]
*  to like overlook the reality, though, of that, of the impulse that like, that I think that I think [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=798.4s)]
*  people broadly have, like lost confidence in government don't even know. I think don't even [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=806.0s)]
*  don't even have a clear sense of what government is doing in their lives, even when it is doing [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=811.6s)]
*  positive things. And I think the I'm in New York and the the former governor Andrew Cuomo, who's [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=815.92s)]
*  running for for for mayor right now, basically operates on the theory that people have lost [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=821.04s)]
*  faith in government so fully that the only way you can impress them is by building physical [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=827.52s)]
*  buildings, because nothing else people don't even really believe it. And I think, you know, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=831.36s)]
*  there's this part of the impulse that got Trump elected, which is we got to sweep all this stuff [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=835.84s)]
*  aside. And I think there's no real sense of and replace it with what. And so that we're in this [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=840.48s)]
*  moment when they're pretty good at breaking things and don't have a clear theory on what to replace [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  them with. Yeah. And then going back to how we started this video, when those things are [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=849.52s)]
*  FEMA resources, when we've seen storm, have you ever seen? Let me ask you this. There have been a [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  lot of very deadly storms over the past several weeks. We've seen dozens of people die in Kentucky [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  seems to be getting hit over and over again, but also in Missouri, in Mississippi, in Arkansas, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=869.44s)]
*  in Indiana. We also have, you know, incidents where we've had troops die or troops died in [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  Lithuania to two of our soldiers died in New Mexico as part of the group of soldiers that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump sent to the border. See, I remember in the past you would have a commander in chief [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=892.8s)]
*  for a president during those times, just address, Hey, this is, you know, a tragic incident. Our [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=898.8s)]
*  heart goes out. We're going to do everything we can. And a lot of these storms, we see FEMA not [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=907.04s)]
*  showing up or showing up late when it comes to the soldiers in Lithuania. Lithuania gave a very [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=912.0s)]
*  somber ceremony, nothing, no mention from the U S and I also don't. And it seems that when Donald [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=918.56s)]
*  Trump doesn't ignores it, the story kind of fades. And so in some extent there's a reward [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=924.24s)]
*  structure for him not addressing these things because it just kind of goes away. What's your [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=931.36s)]
*  perspective though? I think that's like an incredible, a very astute observation, right? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=935.92s)]
*  I think like, I mean, it is that he just refuses to engage things that he doesn't want to talk [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=940.24s)]
*  about. And that he is so much everybody's editor in chief and assignment editor that often he's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=947.04s)]
*  able to totally control what the whole media is talking about. You know, I do see, I mean, again, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=953.44s)]
*  like I think the thing about being president though, is that reality starts to intervene [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=959.84s)]
*  and, and, and presidents imagine, and this is not, not so not, not unique to Trump, they can kind [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  of control and shape reality. And ultimately, you know, I think each of these things is a risk, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  right? Like you sort of bang FEMA around and cut 20% of weather balloons. I'm like, maybe you get [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=976.24s)]
*  away with it. Or maybe like there's a, you know, we had a story, interesting story that like the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=982.64s)]
*  way we, the weather, the weather balloons, they're single use, they're pretty expensive, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=986.64s)]
*  they're pretty clunky. And there's this Stanford program that has cheaper, better weather balloons. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=990.16s)]
*  Like maybe those things will get up in time and maybe it'll work. Or maybe there'll be a horrible [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  disaster. And, and, and I, and there is a, I think this administration, you certainly see it in the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=999.12s)]
*  health and human services department, which we haven't talked about, is just willing to run huge [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1004.0s)]
*  risks with and, and, you know, and, and when, then when something truly goes wrong, I think [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1007.76s)]
*  obviously they'll be blamed. You know, well, we heard Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa say, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1014.96s)]
*  well, we're all going to die anyway. So true facts, right? Well, except as I heard, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1021.04s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffrey's democratic leaders said, except we don't expect it to come from intentional [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1026.96s)]
*  policies from Republican cruelty. We'd prefer it to be of, of, of older age. Ben, where can people [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgRKitFpuR0&t=1031.76s)]
