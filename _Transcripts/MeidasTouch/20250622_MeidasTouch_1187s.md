# FURIOUS India REBUKES Trump and CANCELS VISIT
**MeidasTouch:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI)
*  Let me explain to you how furious India continues to be at Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi of India is now bragging and boasting in speeches that he's been given [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=6.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump, with a great deal of insistence, was trying to get Modi to show up for dinner [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=12.92s)]
*  at the White House earlier in this week, and Modi said, I had to politely decline the invitation [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=19.96s)]
*  as I had other things to do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=27.8s)]
*  So the Prime Minister of India saying that he declined showing up to the White House, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=30.24s)]
*  which once upon a time would have been a great honor for any foreign leader to show up and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=35.68s)]
*  have dinner with the President of the United States. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=41.12s)]
*  Well, what has been going on? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=44.44s)]
*  Why is India so furious? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=47.28s)]
*  If you've been following our coverage here at the Midas Touch Network, you know that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  that has been pissing India off so much is that Donald Trump continues to take credit [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  for the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  For India, this is a sense of national pride that they dealt with this ceasefire with no [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=63.86s)]
*  mediation and according to India, Pakistan was essentially begging for a ceasefire after [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  India engaged in targeted military strikes at certain terroristic hubs following the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=77.9s)]
*  Kashmir terrorist attacks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  India says Trump had nothing to do with it and also it is offensive to the sovereignty [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  and dignity of India for Donald Trump to continue saying that not only did Trump negotiate the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire, which is false, but that Donald Trump dangled trade over the head of the Indian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  government and that's what caused the ceasefire. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=107.42s)]
*  Trump's like, you want to do some trade with us, India? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=110.34s)]
*  You want to do some trade with us, Pakistan? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=113.06s)]
*  Okay, you need to make peace with each other and India says that did not happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=115.42s)]
*  Now India got so pissed that its foreign minister had to issue a public statement to the people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=120.7s)]
*  of India after Donald Trump refused to show up to day two of the G7 where Trump was supposed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=127.54s)]
*  to meet with leaders like Prime Minister Modi. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=135.18s)]
*  Trump was also supposed to meet with Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=138.38s)]
*  Trump was supposed to meet with Zelensky. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=143.88s)]
*  Trump was supposed to meet with Scheinbaum, but Trump acted like a petulant child, no [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=146.26s)]
*  offense to petulant childs, and he lasted for about four to five hours at the G7 before [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=151.34s)]
*  coming home. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=157.42s)]
*  Now, India is also furious because they see Donald Trump as admiring the Pakistani leaders, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=158.98s)]
*  the authoritarian leaders of Pakistan. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=166.77999999999997s)]
*  Now here's what went down behind the scenes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=169.42s)]
*  You're not going to really see this reporting in American media, but it's important that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  you, our audience here at the Midas Touch Network, know what's happening at a geopolitical [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  level so you can see the dynamics as America's relationship with various countries deteriorate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=180.94s)]
*  Even though India was optimistic that it would be able to try to make deals with Donald Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=188.64s)]
*  So here's one of the things that went down. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=193.28s)]
*  The Trump family accepted a massive crypto investment back on April 28th, 2025 from the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=195.6s)]
*  Pakistani government who invested millions of dollars in an entity called World Liberty [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  Financial. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=211.04s)]
*  The Trump family has a 60% ownership in this crypto enterprise, World Liberty Financial. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=212.42s)]
*  And here's what World Liberty Financial posted April 28th, 2025. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=220.06s)]
*  Historic moment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=224.98s)]
*  World Liberty Financial has officially signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=226.64s)]
*  It was an incredible experience meeting with the Pakistan Crypto Council and the leaders [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  shaping the future of crypto. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  We're proud to be building with Pakistan to drive innovation forward. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=238.86s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=243.12s)]
*  It's really pissed off India. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=244.9s)]
*  And they said, look, we have a history of great trading relationships with the United [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=246.22000000000003s)]
*  States and now the Trump regime is attacking American corporations like Apple or attacking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=250.58s)]
*  foreign corporations like Samsung for doing business in India. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=258.22s)]
*  And the Trump regime says they will cause harm to companies that build factories in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=263.22s)]
*  India. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=268.82000000000005s)]
*  But then the Trump family is doing crypto deals with Pakistan and Pakistan seeming [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=269.82000000000005s)]
*  to build its influence within the United States. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=274.86s)]
*  And then earlier this week, Donald Trump met with the chief field marshal, basically the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=278.62s)]
*  chief of staff, the head of the Pakistan army, someone named Aseem Munir. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=286.22s)]
*  And the White House and the Trump regime rolled out the red carpet for this guy and treated [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  him like he was one of the biggest dignitaries that there were. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  And this pissed off India as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  Now one of the things that Pakistan did in order to basically stick the dagger in India [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=308.1s)]
*  and piss India off and suck up to Donald Trump based on Trump's vanity and now Trump and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  MAGA are bragging about this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=322.02s)]
*  Pakistan nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize saying that Donald Trump negotiated [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=325.5s)]
*  the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=332.02s)]
*  And Pakistan did that knowing that that would piss off India because Trump did not negotiate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=335.38s)]
*  the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=341.06s)]
*  But Trump wants to take credit for it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=343.82s)]
*  So I want to show you the data points here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=346.64s)]
*  And the fact that Trump and MAGA are bragging that Pakistan, an authoritarian regime that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=348.74s)]
*  has a lot of ties to terroristic activities that are known, is nominating Donald Trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=355.46s)]
*  for a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=362.1s)]
*  And MAGA views that as a positive thing, shows you that there's a lot wrong with Trump and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=364.54s)]
*  the MAGA movement. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=370.66s)]
*  So let me pull out some receipts, shall I? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=372.0s)]
*  So here is again India's foreign minister, Vikram Masiri. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=375.1s)]
*  You'll see a split screen. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=379.98s)]
*  On the one hand, you'll have Donald Trump. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=381.66s)]
*  This is from May 30th, 2025, but Donald Trump has consistently said this, where Trump brags [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=383.74s)]
*  that he did the ceasefire between India and Pakistan by dangling trade. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=389.38s)]
*  And here is India's foreign minister, Vikram Masiri, saying Prime Minister Modi made it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=394.1s)]
*  very clear to Donald Trump that Trump had nothing to do with this, that there's no mediation, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=400.1s)]
*  and to stop saying that the US and Trump negotiated the ceasefire. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=406.3s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=411.34000000000003s)]
*  I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  as opposed to through bullets. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, normally they do it through bullets. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  We do it through trade. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  So I'm very proud of that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi clearly told President Trump that during this entire episode, there [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=425.9s)]
*  was never any discussion at any level about an India-US trade deal or US mediation between [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  India and Pakistan. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=447.73999999999995s)]
*  The discussion to halt military action occurred directly between India and Pakistan through [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=450.42s)]
*  existing channels between both armies and was made at Pakistan's request. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India has neither accepted mediation nor does it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=463.02000000000004s)]
*  do so and never will do. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=471.26s)]
*  There is complete political unanimity on this subject in India. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=475.18s)]
*  President Trump understood the details explained by the Prime Minister and expressed support [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=480.7s)]
*  for India's fight against terrorism. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=488.02s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi also said that India now sees terrorism not as a proxy war, but as [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=491.53999999999996s)]
*  a war. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=499.14s)]
*  If you're someone who's really been struggling to stay off social media and invest in more [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=500.14s)]
*  intellectually stimulating hobbies like reading, having a personal coach might help you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  That's why I want to talk about Strawberry.me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  The coaching experience offers this really unique approach. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  Instead of you just talking about your feelings and past experiences like therapy usually [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=516.1s)]
*  does, they instead focus on present and future goals. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=520.62s)]
*  I actually hopped on a session with Dean, who is one of their certified coaches, and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=525.02s)]
*  was surprised at his ability to ask me questions that really helped me get to the root problems [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=529.9399999999999s)]

*  Aseem Munir, hanging out in Washington DC, meeting with the Pentagon. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=584.86s)]
*  And by the way, that's pissing India off. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  They're like, you're letting this guy in and you're giving him this tour? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=591.78s)]
*  And so on Friday, Donald Trump is asked about world developments and Donald Trump starts [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=597.66s)]
*  saying, I need a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=605.98s)]
*  I should get one for Rwanda. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=608.9s)]
*  I should get one for Serbia. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  And he goes, the big one that I should get a Nobel Peace Prize for is the ceasefire between [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=613.66s)]
*  India and Pakistan. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=618.86s)]
*  Now as you just saw there, this is a very, very big problem for India that Donald Trump [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=620.9s)]
*  keeps on saying this. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=627.26s)]
*  And it's also very disrespectful to Modi and the billion people who live in India that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump continues to say he dangled trade and that got India to submit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=633.5s)]
*  Trump's obsessed with saying that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=639.54s)]
*  Here he talks about it on Friday. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=641.4599999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=643.18s)]
*  Former Congressman Matt Gaetz brought an interesting idea suggesting that if you were to broker [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=644.18s)]
*  a deal where nuclear inspectors go into both Israel and Iran, that you could win a Nobel [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=650.14s)]
*  Peace Prize and they might even rename it the Trump Peace Prize. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=655.14s)]
*  Did you hear those? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=657.66s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=658.66s)]
*  Well, they should give me the Nobel Prize for Rwanda. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=659.66s)]
*  And if you look the Congo or you could say Serbia, Kosovo, you could say a lot of them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=661.8199999999999s)]
*  You could say I mean, the big one is India and Pakistan. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=668.3s)]
*  I should have gotten it four or five times. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=674.18s)]
*  They should get it for the. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=676.06s)]
*  I would think the Abraham Accords would be a good one, too. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=678.3s)]
*  They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=681.78s)]
*  So the government of Pakistan tries to take advantage of that and they go, oh, all we [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=685.18s)]
*  have to do is play to Donald Trump's vanity and he'll forego his alliance and his relationship [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=692.38s)]
*  with India in favor of us. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=698.38s)]
*  So here's what the government official government of Pakistan account posts. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=701.0s)]
*  The government of Pakistan recommends Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=705.62s)]
*  The government of Pakistan has decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=710.22s)]
*  Peace Prize in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=715.1800000000001s)]
*  during the recent India-Pakistan crisis. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  Now pause there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  You see what Pakistan is doing right there after India's foreign minister went out there [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  and said, you got to stop saying that you mediated this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=729.14s)]
*  They want to create a wedge between US-India relations by Pakistan saying, nope, Trump, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=733.22s)]
*  you did it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=740.1s)]
*  Congrats, Trump. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=741.1s)]
*  We couldn't have done this without you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=742.34s)]
*  They go on to say, the international community bore witness to the unprovoked and unlawful [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=744.48s)]
*  Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=749.58s)]
*  integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=755.78s)]
*  and the elderly. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=760.22s)]
*  In exercising its fundamental right to self-defense, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyum Marsus, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=761.42s)]
*  a measured, resolute and precise military response, carefully executed to reestablish [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=769.5s)]
*  deterrence and defend its territorial integrity while conscientiously avoiding civilian harm. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=775.12s)]
*  At a moment of heightened regional turbulence, Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=782.26s)]
*  statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, which [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=788.9s)]
*  deescalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=794.62s)]
*  a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=801.22s)]
*  for millions of people in the region and beyond. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  This intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=810.0s)]
*  to conflict resolution through dialogue. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=815.96s)]
*  So do you actually see how Donald Trump's behavior here and how he wants to crave all [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  of this attention for himself is creating destabilization in regions like now between [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=825.52s)]
*  India and Pakistan because essentially Donald Trump is now incorporating by reference Pakistan's [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=831.4000000000001s)]
*  version of events and that is pissing India off. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump posted the following on his social media. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=841.88s)]
*  I'm very happy to report that I have arranged, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=845.16s)]
*  a wonderful treaty between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Rwanda [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=850.48s)]
*  in their war, which was known for violent bloodshed and death more so than even most [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=855.64s)]
*  other wars and has gone on for decades. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=862.04s)]
*  Representatives for Rwanda and the Congo will be in Washington on Monday to sign documents. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=864.88s)]
*  This is a great day for Africa and quite frankly a great day for the world. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=870.08s)]
*  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=874.8s)]
*  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=877.12s)]
*  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=885.64s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump doesn't know where Congo is. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=889.9599999999999s)]
*  And again, I'm not just saying that to like mock him. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=893.52s)]
*  He genuinely does not know where Congo is here. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=895.68s)]
*  Let me show you this. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=899.4s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=900.4s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=901.76s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=903.6s)]
*  I think this is an article from The Guardian. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=906.44s)]
*  The thawing of relations between Pakistan and US raises eyebrows in India. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=909.4s)]
*  And it goes on to talk about how the leader of Pakistan based on ties, the prime minister [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=915.88s)]
*  of Pakistan, Imran Khan, and certainly their military officials had previously been snubbed [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=922.36s)]
*  by American administrations. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't be greeted at the White House, but Trump rolled out the red carpet for Munir, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=931.76s)]
*  who I just told you about, whisking him off in limousines and treating him like a king. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=938.12s)]
*  By the way, that's after Pakistan made the crypto investment in Trump's family company. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=943.96s)]
*  It talks about how this is raising the eyebrows between the reason the eyebrows in India, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=949.72s)]
*  how the India prime minister did not show up for dinner and didn't want to do dinner [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=955.72s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  Analysts say the pivot for Trump supporting Pakistan seems that it's driven by personal [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=962.8399999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=968.88s)]
*  Quote, he has a thing for strongman, one US analyst said. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=969.88s)]
*  He sees something in Munir from Pakistan, the mystique, the military credentials, the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=974.0s)]
*  aura of control. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump responds to dominance and Munir projects it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  That may help explain why Munir was granted access, usually reserved for heads of state. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=985.4s)]
*  He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=991.24s)]
*  Trump knows that in Pakistan it's the army chief who really runs the show. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=995.1999999999999s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal recently wrote an article and was also republished by the Hudson [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=999.9599999999999s)]
*  Institute. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1004.04s)]
*  Will Trump lose India? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1005.04s)]
*  An ally that welcomed his return to office has serious problems with his policies. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1007.36s)]
*  This was a billboard by the Indian Stock Exchange a few months back. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1013.64s)]
*  Tariff terror is what it called from India today. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1018.04s)]
*  Thank you, but what Prime Minister Modi said on turning down Trump's invite. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1023.36s)]
*  Modi did not want to be at the White House with Donald Trump. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1030.12s)]
*  There's other reasons too why India is pissed. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1033.12s)]
*  They're pissed at the way that Trump has treated the students from India who have been studying [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1035.7s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1040.76s)]
*  As I mentioned, they're pissed at Donald Trump threatening businesses to not do business [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1042.34s)]
*  in India. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1048.02s)]
*  They're pissed about the way Donald Trump has handled the trade war and its impacts [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1049.02s)]
*  on India. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1053.9399999999998s)]
*  The ceasefire issue is a major issue. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1056.4199999999998s)]
*  I can go region by region, like Canada, Donald Trump calling it the 51st state. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1059.5s)]
*  You can go through Europe. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1067.1799999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump saying that Europe is the worst to deal with. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1069.78s)]
*  They're horrible partners that the European Union's created just to destroy the United [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1073.62s)]
*  States. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1079.58s)]
*  You go to Japan. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1080.58s)]
*  Unable to do a trade deal, Donald Trump makes up that in Japan they have this test where [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1082.46s)]
*  they drop bowling balls on American cars and don't buy American cars after dropping bowling [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1088.28s)]
*  balls on it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1094.02s)]
*  Japan's like, what the hell are you even talking about? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1095.02s)]
*  Japan's like, we did a trade deal with you in 2018. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1098.14s)]
*  You break the deal with us and what is it that you're even asking for? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1103.74s)]
*  You talk about a lot of Australian viewers here at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1106.9s)]
*  Donald Trump snubbing Anthony Albanese and all these world leaders, not just Albanese, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1111.5s)]
*  on day two of the G7. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1116.66s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't know what the AUKUS trilateral deal is between Australia, UK, and the US. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1118.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump has people who want to pull the United States out of AUKUS used as kind [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1125.78s)]
*  of a nuclear deterrent and to help Australia's military project against threats in the region [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1131.62s)]
*  like China and other places. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVdQw7U6YI&t=1137.3s)]
