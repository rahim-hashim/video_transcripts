# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE after Trump INVASION OF LA
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc)
*  You just shut the fuck up! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=0.0s)]
*  That was Australian reporter Lauren Thomassey getting shot at with rubber bullets by the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=5.72s)]
*  militarized police in Los Angeles. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=11.48s)]
*  Just two days ago, the LAPD had put out a statement on Saturday saying that the protests [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  were peaceful, they were under control, that a combination of LAPD combined with the LA [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=21.52s)]
*  sheriffs had everything where it needed to be. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=28.92s)]
*  But then Donald Trump decided to escalate things. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=33.04s)]
*  Donald Trump declared war on the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  He activated the National Guard, as you now know, and federalized the National Guard unlawfully, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=38.46s)]
*  I might add, under a statute that did not provide Donald Trump with the ability to do [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=45.64s)]
*  so. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  And he sent the National Guard as a federalized unit against the people of Los Angeles. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=51.32s)]
*  And Donald Trump tried to provoke this from the outset, really, beginning on Friday, but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=59.16s)]
*  it's been a long time coming. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=64.04s)]
*  He's been doing these ICE raids, and they've been focusing not on criminals or gang bangers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=66.04s)]
*  or people who are doing bad things. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=71.64s)]
*  They're going to hardworking Latino communities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=74.56s)]
*  They're going to courtrooms. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=76.8s)]
*  They're going into factories. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=78.42s)]
*  They're going into neighborhoods and ripping families apart. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=80.48s)]
*  They're going into the Home Depot parking lots. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  It is shameful, shameful behavior. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=87.28s)]
*  But Donald Trump wanted to provoke a situation where he could send in the military. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=90.2s)]
*  And so he started with the National Guard, federalizing it unlawfully. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=95.56s)]
*  There's a lawsuit that is going to be filed today by Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  He's stated that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=104.68s)]
*  And then we got this message from the US Northern Command involving the Marines. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=106.0s)]
*  Donald Trump putting the Marines on duty and preparing the Marines to attack people in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=112.84s)]
*  California. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=118.88s)]
*  This is horrific that I even have to say that sentence, but let me just read for you so [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=119.88s)]
*  you hear it directly from US Northern Command, US Northcom statement regarding protection [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=124.4s)]
*  of federal property and personnel in the Los Angeles area. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=130.2s)]
*  It says from Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado, by direction of Secretary of Defense [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=134.4s)]
*  and in coordination with US Northern Command, approximately 2000 California Army National [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=139.72s)]
*  Guard soldiers have been placed under federal command and control in a Title X status to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=145.1s)]
*  support the protection of federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=150.62s)]
*  area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=155.44s)]
*  Here's the part I want you to focus on as well, because you knew that other part. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=156.44s)]
*  Additionally, approximately 500 Marines from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at 29 Palms, California [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=160.12s)]
*  are in a prepared to deploy status. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=167.96s)]
*  Should they be necessary to augment and support the Department of Defense's protection of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=170.72s)]
*  federal property and personnel effects, US Northcom will provide more information as [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=175.72s)]
*  units are identified and deployed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=181.68s)]
*  And again, I want you to read this news release from LAPD June 7th, 2025, Los Angeles Police [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=184.44s)]
*  Department statement regarding today's peaceful protest. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=190.94s)]
*  Today demonstrations across the city of Los Angeles remain peaceful and we commend all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=195.0s)]
*  those who exercise their First Amendment rights responsibly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=200.16s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department appreciate the cooperation of organizers, participants [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=204.6s)]
*  and community partners who helped ensure public safety throughout the day. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=210.24s)]
*  And most of these protests were indeed peaceful until Trump escalated things and he took it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=216.44s)]
*  outside of the province of California and LAPD and the LA sheriffs and he started declaring [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=222.0s)]
*  war on America. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  So what Trump did as he prepares for his military parade on June 14th, where he's going to do [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  the Kim Jong-un dictator thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=236.28s)]
*  You already see the tanks rolling into DC. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=238.8s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Let me just share with you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  This is what the protest looked like for most of the day before Trump's escalation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=248.4s)]
*  And then you can see what happens when the escalation takes place. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=268.8s)]
*  You know, the police and others pushing the group back in a violent nature. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=294.88s)]
*  Take a look here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=300.2s)]
*  And you talk about this as they're pushing people away and there's close in proximity. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=301.2s)]
*  You can see them pushing this group back in some of the violent nature as you can see [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=305.32s)]
*  them throwing different things. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=309.68s)]
*  And again, one more time, viewer discretion is advised right now watching this unfold, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=311.04s)]
*  these clash between anti-ice demonstrators and local law enforcement on the ground in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=317.56s)]
*  L.A. Then they had less than lethal weapons being deployed against the protesters. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=327.76s)]
*  They need that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=328.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=329.76s)]
*  They had moved them back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=330.76s)]
*  The vehicles are in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=331.76s)]
*  What is the need to fire this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=332.76s)]
*  Not clear from what I saw. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to make sure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=339.84s)]
*  I'm just going to ask because she's in the midst of it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=340.84s)]
*  What sparked them? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=345.28s)]
*  First of all, are you getting peppered yourself? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=346.28s)]
*  Are you feeling this? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  Because that that smoke is insidious. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  And here you can see the National Guardsmen carrying a long stick known as a MOC method, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=351.92s)]
*  a method of control method, carrying a lethal rifle. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  You can see some of this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  It's this entire block appears to be tagged. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  But take a look at these officers. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  These are soldiers rather. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=369.88s)]
*  You can see what they there's about maybe 25 of them standing here in quite a display [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=371.88s)]
*  of a show of force. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=379.12s)]
*  Each of these soldiers, if Mike, you can zoom in a little bit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=380.8s)]
*  They're each carrying a long stick and a rifle. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=384.88000000000005s)]
*  Each one of them is carrying a rifle. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  It appears to be a lethal rifle. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=391.56s)]
*  We don't know what the status of those weapons are, but they certainly are here with their [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=392.92s)]
*  uniforms on and an incredible show of force. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=398.0s)]
*  Armored vehicles also positioned outside of the Metropolitan Detention Center. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=401.24s)]
*  You know, and then you saw the right wing propaganda just start to flood the zone. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=406.56s)]
*  They were showing images from 2020 like this photo from it was a video. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=411.32s)]
*  I'm not going to play the video because it's false. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=416.56s)]
*  But all the right wing was posting this video. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=419.2s)]
*  They would say, if I hear one more leftist shill in mainstream media under the words [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=421.74s)]
*  peaceful protest, I'll throw up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=425.56s)]
*  And as California Governor Gavin Newsom said, you're showing an image from 2020. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  That's not happening right now. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=434.24s)]
*  You have over here Donald Trump making posts like this last night. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=437.76s)]
*  Paid insurrectionists! [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=441.72s)]
*  Posts like this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=445.04s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Bash should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=446.04s)]
*  the absolutely horrible job that they have done. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=451.24s)]
*  And this now includes the ongoing LA riots. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=454.08s)]
*  These are not protesters. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=457.08s)]
*  They are troublemakers and insurrectionists. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=458.36s)]
*  Remember, no masks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=460.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying that he's outlawing masks, that if anybody wears a mask to a protest, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=463.24s)]
*  that that will be deemed a violation of the law and that ICE or the National Guard should [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=468.48s)]
*  go after them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=473.92s)]
*  Donald Trump posted this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=475.16s)]
*  I am directing the Secretary of Homeland Security, Christine Ohm, Secretary of Defense, Pete [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=493.24s)]
*  Hegseth and Attorney General, Pam Bondi, in coordination with all the relevant departments [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=498.76s)]
*  and agencies to take all such action as necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the migrant invasion [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=503.8s)]
*  and put an end to these migrant riots. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=511.52s)]
*  Order will be restored. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=515.04s)]
*  The illegals will be expelled and Los Angeles will be set free. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=516.4s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter! [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=520.8s)]
*  Exclamation point. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=522.8s)]
*  And again, I want to be very clear about this inflammatory language intentionally crafted [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=523.8s)]
*  to escalate. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=529.8s)]
*  Liberate Los Angeles. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=531.88s)]
*  What makes Los Angeles great as someone who lives in Los Angeles is our diversity. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=533.0799999999999s)]

*  I heard lots of people say, who are you going to try to liberate us from? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=549.28s)]
*  Are you going to try to liberate us from ourselves? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=552.92s)]
*  When I say this as someone who's going to get personal with you, someone who's married [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=557.16s)]
*  to someone who's first generation Mexican, whose family crossed the border and came here [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=561.64s)]

*  an incredible Mexican tradition from Guadalajara right here to Los Angeles. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=575.12s)]
*  So don't you dare say you're trying to liberate us. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=580.5600000000001s)]

*  Do not. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=659.72s)]
*  Let me show you what Governor Newsom said last night. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=660.72s)]
*  I thought this was an incredible interview he did with MSNBC. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=663.4s)]
*  He calls Trump's takeover of the National Guard an illegal act and says he will sue. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=673.6s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=674.6s)]
*  He's exacerbated the conditions. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=678.96s)]
*  He's lit the Burberry Hill match. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  He's putting fuel on this fire. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  Ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard in a legal act, in a moral [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=684.76s)]
*  act, an unconstitutional act. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  And we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  I was going to ask you that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=692.76s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you, but Governor, so that's news. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=693.76s)]
*  If you're going to sue the administration, tell me a little bit about it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=696.3599999999999s)]
*  Give us a preview of this lawsuit. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, under his executive order and specifically notes and under what the DOD did is they had [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=700.5999999999999s)]
*  to coordinate with the governor of the state. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  They never coordinate with the governor of the state. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=708.18s)]
*  I've worked with the National Guard. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=710.16s)]
*  We've deployed the National Guard. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=711.68s)]
*  We did three plus thousand folks have been doing logistics work and fire recovery work [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=712.9s)]
*  and they're fighting the fires, the rattlesnake teams. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  We did the same back in George Floyd. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  We had no problem working collaboratively in a mutual aid system, a local law enforcement. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=721.64s)]
*  But there's a protocol. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=726.4s)]
*  There's a process. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=727.4s)]
*  He didn't care about that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=728.4s)]
*  And the worst part, he completely. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=729.4s)]
*  Here Governor Newsom talks about how Trump lied. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=730.72s)]
*  He said that he was going to make everything safe. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=733.64s)]
*  He made things worse. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  The protests were peaceful. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump provoked this. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  Law enforcement, but there's a protocol. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  There's a process. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  He didn't care about that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  And the worst part, he completely lied. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=745.24s)]
*  He said in a tweet that everything's now safe. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=747.24s)]
*  Everything's fine. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=750.36s)]
*  He said, because he deployed the National Guard, the Guard hadn't even been deployed [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=752.12s)]
*  when he said this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=757.2s)]
*  It's Orwellian. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=758.2s)]
*  Simply lying to people. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=759.2s)]
*  Unconstitutional, illegal act. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=761.2s)]
*  His mess. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=764.04s)]
*  We're trying to clean it up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=765.04s)]
*  And here's perhaps my favorite line where Gavin Newsom looks at Tom Homan or points [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=766.64s)]
*  to Tom Homan who says, I'm going to arrest you. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=773.6s)]
*  You know, Tom Homan, the borders are idiot. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=776.64s)]
*  I'm going to arrest Gavin Newsom. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=778.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=780.64s)]
*  Tom Homan. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=781.64s)]
*  That's my impression of Tom Homan. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=782.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=784.64s)]
*  And Gavin Newsom says, come here, tough guy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=785.64s)]
*  Come here, tough guy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=788.64s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=790.36s)]
*  Get it over with. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=791.36s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=792.36s)]
*  Homan, the borders are said to me yesterday. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=793.36s)]
*  He did not rule out literally arresting you, Norm Mayor Bass, if you interfere in his [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=794.36s)]
*  words. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=800.4s)]
*  He said you hadn't yet. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=801.4s)]
*  He said tough guy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=802.4s)]
*  Why doesn't he do that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=803.4s)]
*  He knows where to find me. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=804.4s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=805.4s)]
*  Get your hands off four year old girls that are trying to get educated. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=806.4s)]
*  Get your hands off these poor people who are just trying to live their lives, man. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=809.64s)]
*  Trying to live their lives, paying their taxes. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=815.0s)]
*  Been here 10 years. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=816.52s)]
*  The fear, the horror, the hell is this guy? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=818.0s)]
*  Come after me, arrest me. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=821.92s)]

*  But I care about my community. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=828.12s)]
*  I care about this community. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=829.48s)]
*  The hell are they doing? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=831.4s)]
*  These guys need to grow up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=832.96s)]
*  They need to stop. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=834.04s)]
*  And we need to push back. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=836.04s)]
*  And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbyiw-wQrqc&t=837.36s)]
