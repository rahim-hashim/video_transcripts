*  Very far right wing they call themselves the House Freedom Caucus [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=137.72s)]

*  This past night or in the morning whatever you consider it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=153.36s)]
*  So that they could try to avoid the American people watching what they were doing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=157.24s)]
*  Literally set the hearing at 1 a.m. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=162.44s)]
*  hoping nobody would notice as they started putting amendments into this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Horrible bill like they gave tax exemptions for tanning beds while route while removing hospital beds [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  That's actually a provision in there [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  So they were doing all this shady stuff at 1 a.m [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=179.76s)]
*  But here's what we're learning right now that the House Freedom Caucus chair MAGA Republican [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=182.54s)]
*  Andy Harris just went on Newsmax and said that there's no way with these this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=187.4s)]
*  Reconciliation bill passes today quote this bill actually got worse overnight. There is no way it passes today [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=192.48s)]
*  We may need a couple of weeks to iron everything out, but it's not going anywhere today [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=199.12s)]
*  He claims there was a deal just after midnight [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=204.12s)]
*  But then it was pulled off the table and he doesn't like the salt cap state and local tax deduction cap [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Quote I think we're further away from a deal because that salt cap increase [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=214.32s)]
*  I think upset a lot of conservatives will get to the deal. We're just not at it today [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwJUaxAW03k&t=219.28s)]
