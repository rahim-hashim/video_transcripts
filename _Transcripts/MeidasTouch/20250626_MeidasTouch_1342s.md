# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as GOP LOSES CONTROL at Hearing
**MeidasTouch:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0)
*  All hell broke loose in the House of Representatives and in the Senate as the hearings that were being held by the MAGA Republicans backfired in their face. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=0.0s)]
*  So they had this witness, Alex Norasta. He's a libertarian at the Cato Institute. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=12.3s)]
*  And I don't know if the MAGA Republicans in the House thought this guy was going to be a favorable witness to them, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=18.84s)]
*  but he started talking about how he goes, look, I think we should all be defending Melania Trump here because, let's face it, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=24.72s)]
*  I understand that she probably got here through immigration means that do not meet the smell test, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=32.44s)]
*  but she's got to be around Donald Trump and not a lot of people can do that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=39.44s)]
*  So maybe she should get an award for that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=44.2s)]
*  Maybe you have to give her an Einstein visa for being able to tolerate the stench of the orange Mussolini. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=46.68s)]
*  Watch this guy play this clip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=53.24s)]
*  But I also want to defend Melania real quick. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=54.96s)]
*  Not everybody can marry Donald Trump, and I think that's quite an achievement. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=56.92s)]
*  So I think she deserves credit for that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=61.24s)]
*  Nobody up here could have done it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=63.24s)]
*  You're right. I couldn't do it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=64.44s)]
*  But anyway, so good right here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=66.4s)]
*  And then Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett sees that Norasta is going to be, I think, a pretty favorable witness here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  So I want you to watch as she then basically takes what he says and then she's like, OK, we should talk about Melania and her Einstein visa. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=78.68s)]
*  Yeah, she was a model. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  But what type of model was she really when she met Donald Trump at the Kit Kat Club in New York City, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=91.04s)]
*  which was run by a guy who would link wealthy Manhattan business people to, quote, models from Eastern Europe, models. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=100.0s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  And since we're talking about integrity, I'm confused as to why my Republican colleagues aren't talking about the lack of integrity when it comes to the president's family's visas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  Let me remind you all that Melania, the first lady, a model. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=117.92s)]
*  And when I say model, I'm not talking about Tyra Banks, Cindy Crawford or Naomi Campbell level applied for and was given an EB1 visa. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=122.28s)]
*  And what that stands for is an Einstein visa. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=130.12s)]
*  Now, y'all that don't know, let me tell you how you receive an Einstein visa. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=134.2s)]
*  You're supposed to have some sort of significant achievement, like being awarded a Nobel Peace Prize or Pulitzer, being an Olympic medalist or having other [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=139.52s)]
*  sustained extraordinary abilities and success in sciences, arts, education, business or athletics. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=148.88s)]
*  Last time I checked, the first lady had none of those accolades under her belt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=154.36s)]
*  It doesn't take an Einstein to see that the math ain't math in here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=158.76s)]
*  OK, and then the libertarian Alex Narasta was really getting on the nerves of someone like a MAGA Republican Chip Roy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And a guy like a MAGA Republican Chip Roy tries to claim, right, that he's like he has libertarian views and he's anti-government and anti-establishment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Watch what goes down here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=183.72s)]
*  And she's one of dozens, hundreds, thousands of examples of Americans who are dead because of policies that were advocated for by the Biden administration and people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  parading around as libertarians. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=193.16s)]
*  Ms. Vaughn. Parading around as libertarians? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=194.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=197.0s)]
*  It means exactly what it means. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=197.92s)]
*  Mr. Narastan, it's my time, not yours. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=199.16s)]
*  That's a personal offence. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=200.96s)]
*  It is my time, not yours. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=201.96s)]
*  I don't have any time to listen to libertarian clout. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=203.92s)]
*  I know you don't have any time to listen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=206.2s)]
*  It is killing Americans because that's what you're doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=207.6s)]
*  And you're hiding behind a brand that is resulting in the death of Americans. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=209.76s)]
*  That's a heck of a thing to say to somebody, sir. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=213.8s)]
*  That is totally false. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=215.84s)]
*  I take exception to that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=216.88s)]
*  It's true and everybody in America knows it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=218.04s)]
*  I have not killed anybody, sir. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=220.04s)]
*  And that is really exceptional. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=221.04s)]
*  When you go talk to Alexa Nungare, talk about her daughter no longer being with us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=222.04s)]
*  Beneath you as an individual, I say that to somebody, sir. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=226.0s)]
*  And I thought one of the powerful things as we move to the Senate as well is you had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=228.6s)]
*  Democratic Senator Welch talking to Emil Bové. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  And Emil Bové is one of the top people at the Justice Department. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=238.68s)]
*  He was Donald Trump's personal lawyer. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And Emil Bové has now been nominated to be on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  basically one of the top judges in the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=251.4s)]
*  And Emil Bové was the subject of a massive whistleblower letter by another top federal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=254.6s)]
*  prosecutor who said Emil Bové told all of the prosecutors, F the judges, F them, but [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=260.76s)]
*  use the curse word, F the judges. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=267.32s)]
*  Don't follow what they say. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=269.56s)]
*  Do what the regime says. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=271.24s)]
*  But here's another question where Senator Welch just says, who won the 2020 election? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=273.08s)]
*  And watch, Emil Bové refuses to answer that question. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=279.16s)]
*  Who won the 2020 election for president of the United States? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  President Biden was certified as the winner of that election. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  So you get the standard answer. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  You can't say that he won because he got the majority of votes and also got the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=291.72s)]
*  Electoral College victory. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=297.0s)]
*  I think the characterizations that you just made, Senator, are both political. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=299.24s)]
*  And so I can't address them under the canons. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  And they're also tied up in ongoing litigation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=306.04s)]
*  Help me understand how it's political to state who got the most votes in any election. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=307.88s)]
*  Senator, I'm just trying to be precise. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=321.32s)]
*  The process by which our country declares the victor in an election is a certification [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=324.04s)]
*  process. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=328.84s)]
*  President Biden was certified. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=330.2s)]
*  Now bring in Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, who then asks the question, cross examines [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=331.88s)]
*  the crap out of Emil Bové. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=339.0s)]
*  Did you tell your prosecutors who work for you at the Department of Justice that courts [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=341.8s)]
*  need to go f themselves and you should f what the courts say? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=347.24s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=351.0s)]
*  Turn to the meeting that Mr. Rivani, the whistleblower, has written an extensive [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=351.8s)]
*  complaint about. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=356.92s)]
*  The hearing started with the chairman reading a social media post by the deputy attorney [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=358.2s)]
*  general Blanche, who is present today but not under oath, nor is that social media post [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  under oath. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=370.6s)]
*  So let me ask you, since you are under oath, in the complaint it says, Bové stated that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=370.92s)]
*  DOJ would need to consider telling the courts f you and ignoring any such court order. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=378.68s)]
*  Did you say anything of that kind in the meeting? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=384.68s)]
*  Senator, I have no recollection of saying anything of that kind. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=389.24s)]
*  To the extent I usually. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=392.04s)]
*  Wouldn't you recall, Mr. Bové, if you said or suggested during a meeting with Justice [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  Department lawyers that maybe they should consider telling the court f you? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=397.72s)]
*  It seems to me that would be something you'd remember unless that's the kind of thing you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=401.16s)]
*  say frequently. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=405.48s)]
*  Well, I've certainly said things encouraging litigators at the department to fight hard [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=407.48s)]
*  for valid positions that we have to take in defense of our clients. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=413.32s)]
*  And have you frequently suggested that they say f you and ignore court orders? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=415.8s)]
*  Is that also something you frequently do such you might not remember doing it on this occasion? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  No, and as I explained, I have never directed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=425.24s)]
*  So did you or did you not make those comments during that meeting? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=427.48s)]
*  Which comments, Senator? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  You really need me to repeat it? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=434.52s)]
*  Did you suggest, as Mr. Rouvani wrote, that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=436.04s)]
*  f you and ignore any such court order? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=442.12s)]
*  I did not suggest that there would be any need to consider ignoring court orders at [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=445.24s)]
*  the point of that meeting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=450.92s)]
*  There were no court orders to discuss. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=451.88s)]
*  Well, did you suggest telling the courts f you in any manner? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=454.36s)]
*  I don't recall. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=458.92s)]
*  You just don't remember that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  Now that is how it is done right there. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=462.04s)]
*  Next up, I want to show you Congresswoman Simon. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=466.6s)]
*  And as a lot of these MAGA Republican witnesses, they start to invoke Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=470.12s)]
*  Here's what Congresswoman Simon says. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=478.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=481.08s)]
*  I want to be clear that four out of the five of you last year posted on your social media [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=481.88s)]
*  the words of Dr. King. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=493.56s)]
*  And there are so few folks who actually have studied, who are clear on the theology of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=495.4s)]
*  freedom of King. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=500.44s)]
*  Very few of you have read and studied and have sat in Ebenezer Baptist Church. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  So I would ask you, you keep Dr. King's name out of your mouth. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=507.08s)]
*  If you, like me and the many scholars who will be watching, studied King, you know that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=512.36s)]
*  he and the mothers and the fathers of the civil rights movement and of the movement [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=517.48s)]
*  for emancipation not only would be struck by the conversations in this room, but would be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=523.4s)]
*  shattered by the consequence of lives, of hatred, of abuse of this administration in the name [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=530.52s)]
*  of folks who worked to make this country more free. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=537.8s)]
*  Hey everybody, Ben Mycelis here from the Midas Touch Network. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=542.28s)]
*  I wanted to let you know about my podcast partner, Michael Popak's new law firm. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=545.16s)]
*  It's called the Popak Firm. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=551.0s)]
*  Michael Popak's pursuing his dream of starting his own law firm, really based on the popular [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=553.24s)]
*  demand by all the Midas, Midy and Legal AFers who were approaching Michael Popak with their [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=560.04s)]
*  cases and saying, can you help us? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=565.96s)]
*  And at that time Popak was not able to. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=568.12s)]
*  So he went out on his own. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=571.0s)]
*  He started the Popak Firm where he is now handling catastrophic injury cases like car [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=572.28s)]
*  accident cases, trucking cases, malpractice cases, big negligence cases, wrongful death [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=578.52s)]
*  cases. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  So if you or someone you know have a case like this, the consultation with Popak's firm [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=585.8s)]
*  is free. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  Give them a call. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=592.36s)]
*  See if you have a case. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=593.24s)]
*  It's thepopakfirm.com, thepopakfirm.com or you can call 877-POPAKAF. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=594.68s)]
*  So 1-877-POPOKAF. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=606.2s)]
*  Give Michael Popak a call. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  And I'm really proud of you, Popak. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=612.12s)]
*  Thanks for all the hard work you're putting in. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  So one of the witnesses was Kerry Lake, who now runs Voices of America. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  And she's basically trying to gut it from within. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  Congress member Stanton is from Arizona. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=624.6s)]
*  Watch what he says to her. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  This is perfect. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=629.24s)]
*  There's a more fundamental issue I want to address today and that is character. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=629.96s)]
*  You see, Miss Lake? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=634.5200000000001s)]
*  We have both been public figures in Arizona for a long time. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=635.8s)]
*  I've seen you in action, including your behavior in the last two elections. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=640.5999999999999s)]
*  And let me be clear about something. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  The American people cannot believe a word you say. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  You ran for governor in Arizona in 2022. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=653.56s)]
*  You lost fair and square. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=657.0s)]
*  Instead of conceding, you embarrassed your stealth and our state. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  By lying again and again for years, blaming everything under the sun for your loss, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=665.24s)]
*  except for your own toxic politics. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  You lie about that election to this very day. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=676.6s)]
*  You lied about signatures on mail-in ballots not matching those on file. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=680.28s)]
*  Prove and wrong. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=684.44s)]
*  You lied about ballots being intentionally misprinted and then rejected in Republican area. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=685.48s)]
*  Total BS. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=690.36s)]
*  You lied and said hundreds of thousands of ballots were mishandled. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=692.04s)]
*  Zero evidence. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=695.64s)]
*  You claimed fake ballots were snuck into batches before they were counted. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=697.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=701.4s)]
*  You repeated these lies again and again. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=702.92s)]
*  And you've said even recently, quote, I am the duly elected governor. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=705.8s)]
*  They just stole it, unquote. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=710.04s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=712.44s)]
*  Miss Lake, your new role requires you to tell the truth. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=715.0s)]
*  For decades, whenever authoritarians and dictators suppress the people and claim [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=718.6s)]
*  victory in fraudulent elections, Voice of America countered those lies. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=723.32s)]
*  I can't imagine how people fighting for democracy today and around the world can trust someone [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=728.44s)]
*  who has so shamelessly lied about her own election. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  Will the gentleman yield to the question? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=738.12s)]
*  No, I will not. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=739.88s)]
*  And he goes on. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=740.5200000000001s)]
*  Let's watch it play this clip. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=741.4000000000001s)]
*  How you treat other people that have been questioned. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=742.84s)]
*  The gentlelady will suspend, please. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=744.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  You may continue. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  You lost for governor in 2022 to Katie Hobbs. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=747.1600000000001s)]
*  You lost even worse to Ruben Gallego for Senate in 2024. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=751.0s)]
*  Well, Arizona has another election for governor next year. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  We do us all a favor and run it back and run for governor again. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=760.0400000000001s)]
*  I yield. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=765.32s)]
*  The gentlelady responds. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=765.8800000000001s)]
*  Can I respond to some of that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=766.84s)]
*  Because that was complete insanity. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=768.6800000000001s)]
*  I wish I could yield back the last five minutes of my life, actually. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=771.4000000000001s)]
*  And I want to apologize to the people of Arizona that we have somebody [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=775.72s)]
*  who's representing the folks in one of our great parts of the valley [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=778.92s)]
*  that doesn't care about the integrity of our elections. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  And he goes on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's watch it play this clip. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=787.24s)]
*  You were formally sanctioned by the court, Miss Lake. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=788.92s)]
*  You have been sanctioned twice for providing false information to courts. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=791.4799999999999s)]
*  Isn't that true? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=795.56s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=796.28s)]
*  I was brave enough to fight our shoddy elections and the courts have not caught up. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  That was a yes or no. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=802.92s)]
*  I guess the answer is no. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me reclaim my time. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=805.64s)]
*  You have been sanctioned by both the United. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=806.8399999999999s)]

*  making false factual statements to the court. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=813.32s)]

*  He and his family were subjected to harassment and even death threats because of those lies. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=821.72s)]
*  You told your supporters, Richer and fellow Republican county supervisor, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=827.8000000000001s)]

*  You accused them of deliberately printing the wrong image on ballots [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=836.2s)]
*  to jam tabulators and injecting hundreds of thousands of phony ballots. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=840.5200000000001s)]
*  What a joke. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=846.0400000000001s)]

*  Do you want me to pull emails? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=908.76s)]
*  I want you to show the record of what you did, Miss Lake. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=909.88s)]
*  Well, you can look at it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=913.88s)]
*  Something that's not verified. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=915.24s)]
*  Tell me, show me the record because that's what I hear often [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=917.8s)]
*  time in the business. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=921.32s)]
*  You have to have a record. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=922.12s)]
*  Show me the record that you did, what you did. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=923.72s)]
*  That's all. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=926.44s)]
*  Then you had Pam Bondi, the attorney general. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=927.08s)]
*  She was being asked questions about Trump's meme coin dinner. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=930.84s)]
*  And I want you to watch all of the gaslighting here. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=934.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me show it to you here. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=938.0400000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=939.1600000000001s)]
*  This solicitation of investments in his personal product, his meme coin, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=940.2800000000001s)]
*  led to many people who were coming from foreign countries attending that dinner. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=946.36s)]
*  Don't you think the American people have a right to know? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=951.88s)]
*  And you said yourself, you're very concerned about foreign influence on our government. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  Senator, it is wildly offensive that you would accuse President Trump [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  of not protecting American interests in our country when he is the president that has [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  shut down our borders. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=973.16s)]
*  Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump has done everything to make America safe. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=974.6s)]
*  And you asked me the question, and keep America safe. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=979.48s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=982.92s)]
*  And you're trying to play a gotcha question at a budget hearing when you have murders [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=983.24s)]
*  left and right in your state, violent crimes, and we are doing everything we can to help [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  your liberal state, whether you're liberal or not, we're going to do everything we can [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=995.48s)]
*  to help the citizens of your state. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1001.0s)]
*  And you're trying to avoid that because you're trying to play a gotcha question [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1002.84s)]
*  with the president of the United States, and it's not going to work. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1006.6s)]
*  We're here to talk about our budget for public safety. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1009.24s)]
*  I do believe that as the leader of the Department of Justice, you should be concerned about [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1012.84s)]
*  foreign influence. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1018.12s)]
*  There was obviously a lot of foreign influence and individuals who said they were there for [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1019.08s)]
*  that reason. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1022.92s)]
*  And then Senator Merkley says, so are you going to recommend any ethics guidelines [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1024.04s)]
*  to make sure that foreign influence doesn't find its way into the doors of the White House? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1030.2s)]
*  More gaslighting from here. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1035.16s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1036.52s)]
*  The Department of Justice. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1037.4s)]
*  It's based on the volumes that you won't answer the question about transparency when the president [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1038.1200000000001s)]
*  is asking people to invest in his company and his products and that foreigners are [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1042.28s)]
*  attending these events. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1047.96s)]
*  I think transparency would be appropriate. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1048.92s)]
*  Are you going to recommend any ethics guidelines to make sure that foreign influence is not [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1051.8s)]
*  finding its way in through the doors of the White House? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  How do you characterize foreigners, the illegal aliens that have flowed into our country? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1058.44s)]
*  Is that who you're talking about? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1063.48s)]
*  You don't want to talk about them. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1065.0800000000002s)]
*  You don't want to talk about the crime that has gone rampant throughout this country and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1066.68s)]
*  your state. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  She's then asked by Senator Murray, so will you not allow the conduct by Todd Blanche [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1073.24s)]
*  and Emile Bové to tell prosecutors at the DOJ to go F the federal courts or don't F-ing [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1080.28s)]
*  follow what the courts say or F them? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1087.64s)]
*  Because that seems to be unlawful if they're doing that. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1090.2s)]
*  Do you not support that or do you support that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1093.0800000000002s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1095.5600000000002s)]
*  I just want you to confirm for this, you will not allow conduct like that at the DOJ. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1102.68s)]
*  I will always support and defend Emile Bové and I will defend Todd Blanche. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1103.96s)]
*  They are two of the finest people I know and two of the most ethical people I know. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1108.2800000000002s)]
*  And then Congressmember Stanton asked Carrie Lake, are you going to admit that Trump lost [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  the election? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1116.84s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1117.48s)]
*  Are you finally ready to admit you lost the 2022 Arizona election? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1118.36s)]
*  It saddens me that you are from Arizona and you're okay with it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1125.0s)]
*  Yes or no question, Ms. Lake? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1129.0s)]
*  That you are from Arizona. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1130.84s)]
*  I think the answer is no. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1131.9599999999998s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1133.24s)]
*  The gentleman, the gentleman will suspend, will stop the clock. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1134.36s)]
*  For all present, members are reminded to avoid engaging in personality [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1138.1999999999998s)]
*  toward the president and other members. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1143.72s)]
*  Okay, and this is a member of the administration. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1147.96s)]
*  So I would caution all to stay on the subjects and stay off of personalities. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1150.84s)]
*  Would love to. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  Please. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1157.1599999999999s)]
*  The gentleman may continue. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1157.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, and in this case, these are adjudicated lies. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1159.0s)]
*  Courts of law have determined that these are lies. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1162.6s)]
*  These are not me saying it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1166.2s)]
*  You didn't just lie to the press. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1167.56s)]
*  The courts are really awesome right now. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1169.0s)]
*  You took those lies to court. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1170.2s)]
*  And then I like this last clip right here of Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren saying, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1172.28s)]
*  just explain to the American people what has changed in the last six months [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1178.44s)]
*  that has caused the Fed to forecast higher inflation right now. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1182.84s)]
*  Watch what civil normal intelligent conversation looks like. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1187.32s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1191.08s)]
*  So Chair Powell, the Fed released its updated economic projections last week, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1191.88s)]
*  and I appreciate your summary, but I want to look at the trend lines here. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1196.6s)]
*  The Fed's outlook on inflation, the labor market, and GDP growth have all gotten worse. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1200.28s)]
*  Compared to your economic projections in December, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1206.36s)]
*  the latest numbers show that the Fed is now projecting higher inflation [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1209.6399999999999s)]
*  from 2.5% in December now to 3.1%. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  Higher unemployment from 4.3% to 4.5%. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1218.04s)]
*  Lower economic growth from 2.1% projected just six months ago [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1222.68s)]
*  to 1.4% that you're now projecting. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1228.36s)]
*  Chair Powell, what has changed in the last six months that has caused the Fed [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1232.1999999999998s)]
*  to forecast substantially higher inflation, somewhat higher unemployment, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1237.9599999999998s)]
*  and lower economic growth than you did in December? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1242.76s)]
*  Some of it is just taking signal from data reports that we've seen. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1246.76s)]
*  Some of it is people working in the possible effects in the short term of tariffs. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1251.08s)]
*  We have no view on the wisdom or the longer term effects of trade policy. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1257.4s)]
*  It's not our job. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1261.24s)]
*  And by the way, I should add, our forecasts are generally, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1262.2800000000002s)]
*  and in this case are very, very similar to what outside forecasts are called for. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1265.5600000000002s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just using you as the gold standard here. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1269.72s)]
*  I know it's consistent, but you mentioned tariffs as [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1272.0400000000002s)]
*  one of the things that has changed over the last six months. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1276.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump has become president and the economy has headed down. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1279.96s)]
*  Not only does the Fed data now show slower growth and higher prices this year, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1285.24s)]
*  it sees slower growth and higher prices over the next two years as well. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1290.9199999999998s)]
*  And the Fed sees no longer term boost to the economy or drop in inflation. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1296.52s)]
*  In other words, no upside to Trump's chaotic tariff war or his other economic policies. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1301.8s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1309.0s)]
*  Let me know what you think. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRnFZ_Q2t0&t=1310.1999999999998s)]
