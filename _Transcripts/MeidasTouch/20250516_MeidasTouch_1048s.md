# WOW! Trump GETS HUMILIATED as GOP VOTES AGAINST Budget
**MeidasTouch:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs)
*  This is an unmitigated disaster for MAGA Mike Johnson folks, and we've been predicting it here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Midas Touch Network. Donald Trump's quote, big, beautiful budget end quote, was just voted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=6.4s)]
*  down by members of the GOP in the Budget Committee. Yep, the GOP members shot down Trump's budget. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=14.16s)]
*  They said it was going to increase the deficit by trillions of dollars. And get this, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=23.28s)]
*  there is even more opposition to Trump's bill in the Senate than in the House, but this bill has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=29.68s)]
*  been derailed in the Budget Committee. MAGA Mike Johnson yesterday was saying, nope, it's on track, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=36.32s)]
*  things are going great. Here on the Midas Touch Network, we were saying, nope, remember what we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=43.28s)]
*  reported earlier this morning as well? We said that bill ain't going to make it out of the Budget [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=47.28s)]
*  Committee. And here's the moment where the House Budget Committee failed to advance the GOP tax [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=51.76s)]
*  and spending bill 16 to 21. There were four no votes, then there was a fifth vote that was made [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=58.24s)]
*  by someone in order to reintroduce this, perhaps in the future. Let me show you what went down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=65.84s)]
*  Let's play the clip. The clerk shall report. Mr. Chair, on the vote, there were 16 ayes and 21 nos. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=71.44s)]
*  Well, the nos have it. The committee stands in recess subject to the call of the chair. I want to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=82.24s)]
*  thank everybody for their time and patience and Godspeed and safe travels. So here's what was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=90.64s)]
*  going down in real time. You had MAGA Republican Congress member Norman, a no vote. MAGA Republican [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=98.16s)]
*  Congress member Chip Roy, a no vote. MAGA Republican Congress member Breachin, a no vote. MAGA [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=104.8s)]
*  Republican Congress member Clyde, a no vote. And then MAGA Republican Congress member Lloyd Smucker [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=110.88s)]
*  changed his vote to a no, likely in order to try to, I guess, bring this back up. But the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  House budget's vote on that reconciliation bill has failed. MAGA might humiliated by MAGA Republicans, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=124.72s)]
*  a major Friday disaster for Donald Trump. Now, we got wind of this as well when we saw [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=134.24s)]
*  Ralph Norman, MAGA Republican, and others kind of walking with a smile on their face. Earlier today, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  they kind of indicated what was about to go down. We thought this was going to happen, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  but MAGA Mike was lying and saying it wasn't. Here's what MAGA Republican Ralph Norman was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=155.68s)]
*  doing earlier in the day when he was walking there and he's like, not going to tell you what [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=160.56s)]
*  I'm going to do. Here, play this clip. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=164.48s)]
*  Ralph, no. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=190.56s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=192.56s)]
*  Now, you'll recall yesterday MAGA Mike Johnson was, surprise, surprise, lying. By the way, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=200.56s)]
*  this guy is the worst Speaker of the House ever. We'll see if he's going to lose his job now soon. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=207.6s)]
*  I think MAGA Mike is indeed on the chopping blocks. But yesterday MAGA Mike says, this big, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=214.56s)]
*  beautiful bill, it's all going to plan. Yes, we have some issues around SALT, the state and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=220.08s)]
*  local tax deduction, but that's not even the issue that ended up crushing it. It was the people, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=228.48s)]
*  it was right-wing MAGA's on the Budget Committee who said this was adding trillions of dollars to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=234.0s)]
*  the deficit. So they haven't got to the SALT issue and they haven't even got to the Senate, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=239.2s)]
*  where there's more opposition. Here's what MAGA Mike was saying yesterday. Play this clip. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=243.92s)]
*  Very brief because discussions are ongoing, but we had a good sampling of the conference in my [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  conference room here for the last couple of hours. We had the SALT caucus, the leadership of the SALT [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=254.56s)]
*  caucus, five or six of those members. And then we had a sampling of others. We had the chairman of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=258.64s)]
*  the Republican Study Committee, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, another sampling of members who [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=263.36s)]
*  are from committees of jurisdiction, including Ways and Means. And it was a very thoughtful [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=268.4s)]
*  discussion. I'm sure you'll talk to many of them individually, but I think everyone will say [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=272.4s)]
*  it was productive and that we are moving the ball forward. Everyone has known that the SALT issue [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=276.24s)]
*  is one of the big ones that we have to resolve. It's one of the key pieces of this equation to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=282.24s)]
*  sort of meet the equilibrium point that everybody can be satisfied with. Not everybody's going to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=287.52s)]
*  be delighted with every provision in a bill this large, but everyone can be satisfied. And we're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  very, very close to that. So I've committed to work throughout the weekend on it. Others are as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=296.96s)]
*  well. And I'm convinced that we'll be able to adjust the dial, so to speak, so that we can come [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=301.76s)]
*  to an agreement that will meet the criteria that everybody has and that we can move this thing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=306.96s)]
*  forward. We are still on path to pass this bill next week, to have it on the floor. That's always [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=311.52s)]
*  been the plan. And I don't see anything that would impede that right now. As I mentioned, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=316.32s)]
*  there's even more resistance to this horrible, atrocious tax bill that by its own very terms [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=321.28s)]
*  raises the debt ceiling by almost $5 trillion. There's more opposition in the Senate to this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=328.56s)]
*  than even in the House of Representatives. So this thing still has to go to the Senate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=335.68s)]
*  And senators have said, this is dead on arrival. Even if you pass this thing, which it didn't even [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=342.16s)]
*  get out of the Budget Committee, they said, we ain't passing this thing. This is why I like to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=347.44s)]
*  show you the receipts. I don't want to buy media narratives. Let's just listen to what the people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=352.88s)]
*  are saying, right? Here's Mago Republican Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. Here's what he's got to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=357.44s)]
*  say about this. Play this clip. Can you see yourself voting for this big, beautiful bill at all? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=362.88s)]
*  Not in the current structure. No, I refuse to vote for something that's going to actually increase [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=370.24s)]
*  the deficits, exacerbate the problem from the current situation. Again, we shouldn't be talking [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=376.72s)]
*  about this right now. We should have been doing all the work. Like I say, the multi-step process, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=382.96s)]
*  we'd already have the border funding. We'd have defense. We'd have $850 billion of real savings [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=387.44s)]
*  banked already. Plus we could have extended current tax law, take a tax light increase off the table. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=393.12s)]
*  We could have had all that done, but unfortunately, the decisions were made to do one big, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=398.24s)]
*  beautiful bill. It's not beautiful. I'm sorry. It's not a big, beautiful bill. That's called [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=402.88s)]
*  rhetoric. This is one thing. This is one thing. He's a no vote. Then you've got Mago Republican [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=407.2s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. He's a no vote. So Senator Johnson, Senator Paul, here, play this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  clip. Senator, what do you need to see in this bill to be on board? The problem is, is it's asking [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=420.4s)]
*  conservatives like myself to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion. That's historic. No one's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=426.48s)]
*  ever raised the debt ceiling that much. It will be a record for Congress to raise the debt $5 [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=434.0s)]
*  trillion. But also it indicates that this year the deficit will be over 2 trillion, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=438.48s)]
*  but it means they're anticipating close to 3 trillion for the next year. It's really a slap [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=444.48s)]
*  in the face at those of us who are excited about Elon Musk and Doge and all the cuts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=449.12s)]
*  Where are the cuts? If the cuts are real, why are we going to borrow 5 trillion? So what I proposed [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=453.92s)]
*  was this. I put forward a proposal and we voted on it to raise the debt ceiling for three months. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=459.12s)]
*  Why? Because I think we should vote on the debt ceiling every three or four months to see if [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=464.24s)]
*  they're doing their job. If they promise us cuts in spending, not just the administration, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=468.48s)]
*  I'm talking about congressional leaders as well. If the promises are real, I'll vote to raise it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=472.88s)]
*  every three months. So I'm really looking forward to Mother's Day this year. It's going to be a very [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=477.92s)]
*  special day. It's always a special day, but it's extra special this year because my wife Sochi just [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=482.8s)]
*  became a mom to our beautiful baby girl Jimena who's seven months old and my mom who just became [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=488.16s)]
*  a grandma is going to get to spend the day with us as well. And I got Sochi and my mom the best gift, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  but shh, don't tell them what it is. I'm just going to tell you. I got them an Aura digital [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  picture frame where I was able to load some of the best memories from the past seven months [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  of my mom's granddaughter and my wife's daughter Jimena and all of us together. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  Normally these photos would just be on my phone and I wouldn't know what to do with them, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=520.4s)]
*  but now with this Aura digital picture frame, they get to display it at their house or [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  in their living room or wherever and they get to see these photos that I've personally curated [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  for them. Aura frames was named the best digital photo frame by Wirecutter. It's featured in 495 [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=536.88s)]
*  gift guides from last year. So the next time you need to call your mom, you can also send her a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=543.52s)]
*  new pic of you from that trip you've been telling her all about right from your phone. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  Aura has a great Mother's Day deal for a limited time. Listeners of our podcast can save on the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=552.48s)]
*  perfect gift by visiting AuraFrames.com to get $35 off plus free shipping on their best selling [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=558.24s)]

*  And ultimately what you got is these MAGA Republicans who also want to cut Medicaid. By the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  way, the MAGA Republicans who voted to block this bill in the budget committee, who derailed this [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=587.92s)]
*  thing in the budget committee, they're also the people who want Medicaid cut like a lot of them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=595.36s)]
*  These are the people. So their view is that if their view is you have to cut Medicaid or else [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=602.4s)]
*  you're going to balloon the deficit. So how are they even ever going to solve this? I mean, take [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=608.4s)]
*  a look. This is MAGA Republican Buddy Carter talking about ending Medicaid. Play this clip. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=612.16s)]
*  We're trying to get on Medicaid and yet we've got some able bodies who really should not be on there [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=617.12s)]
*  or should be able to go to another insurance product that would help them to have health [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=624.0s)]
*  insurance. And yes, we all agree that we want to try to make sure everybody has access to health [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=631.68s)]
*  care, but at the same time, not on the program that was intended for the most vulnerable in our [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=636.48s)]
*  society. Yeah. Oh, look, I mean, I'm sure there's a fair amount of waste to be cut as well. And this [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=642.24s)]
*  was yesterday as well when you had MAGA Republican Jason Smith go on Will Kane's show. Here's what [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=647.68s)]
*  they had to say. Let's play this clip. One of the debates your colleagues are having as well [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=655.12s)]
*  is over Medicaid cuts and are they steep enough or are they too steep? There seems to be a little [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  bit of divide like that on the right. Congressman Roy was on our program yesterday and he said, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=663.76s)]
*  whether or not it's salt or whether or not it's Medicaid cuts, it's not enough. And he reflects [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=669.12s)]
*  some other voices out there like some senators that he'll have to go through eventually as well, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=673.3599999999999s)]
*  like Ron Johnson. This is what they had to say. There's a lot of overlap there for the big blue [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=676.88s)]
*  states that are taking a lot of Medicaid money for all of these able-bodied people. I think we need [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=683.2s)]
*  those reforms. So if they want their salt increase, maybe they should come work with us on Medicaid. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=687.92s)]
*  I think that Scott Besson is right, but let's be very clear. All we're talking about to Ron [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=692.8s)]
*  John's point, Senator Ron Johnson, is $150 billion a year in savings in this bill out of a $7 trillion [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=697.92s)]
*  spend for your government. Chairman, is there enough? Is it enough deficit reduction to get [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=706.16s)]
*  the votes that you're going to need to pass the House and the Senate? You know, failure is not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=712.72s)]
*  an option, Will, because if we're not able to pass this bill, what's even worse is that there's zero [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  spending cuts. And what's even worse is that all the IRA credits are intact. That would happen [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=723.6s)]
*  if we're not able to pass this bill. If we pass what the House has projected to pass, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=730.08s)]
*  and that's one point. Let me say when we pass what the House has projected to pass, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=735.28s)]
*  the $1.5 trillion worth of cuts would be 300% more than what's ever been cut by any Congress [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=740.64s)]
*  in the history of America. But we could do better. I totally agree. But it's all about balancing and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=748.72s)]
*  we can't lose more than three people. So we just have to thread that needle. But if we can't pass [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=754.88s)]
*  this bill, there's going to be zero in cuts. That's what I would I would let my colleagues know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=759.76s)]
*  And folks, even Josh Hawley, mega Republican Josh Hawley from Missouri, even he was basically saying, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=766.16s)]
*  look, one of the big problems about this tax bill is it cuts Medicaid. And he's like, I can't [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=776.08s)]
*  have to give a I don't want to give Hawley credit for much. But at least he says here, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=782.48s)]
*  we can cut Medicaid. And he admits that Trump's bill is going to cut Medicaid. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=786.88s)]
*  And this bill is what failed to pass in the House today. Play this clip. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=792.0s)]
*  Medicaid. Do you agree with the speaker? Is this bill not a cut to Medicaid? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=795.28s)]
*  Well, the right thing to do is not to cut Medicaid. So I'm glad to hear him say that, Manu. It ought [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=801.68s)]
*  to be just a basic foundational principle. It is wrong to cut health care for the working poor. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=806.08s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here with Medicaid. My state is a Medicaid expansion state. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=811.6s)]
*  Over 20 percent of Missourians, including hundreds of thousands of children, are on [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=815.68s)]
*  Medicaid. And Manu, they're not on Medicaid because they want to be there on Medicaid because they [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=819.5999999999999s)]
*  cannot afford health insurance in the private market. These are working people and their children [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=823.92s)]
*  who need health care. And it's just wrong to go and cut their health care when they're trying [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=829.68s)]
*  to make ends meet, trying to help their kids, trying to make sure that they're able to provide [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=834.0799999999999s)]
*  for their families. So I hope that the House GOP and the Senate GOP will get the message here. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=838.0s)]
*  By the way, President Trump has said the same thing. No Medicaid benefit cuts. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=842.64s)]
*  Last point I want to make, too. There's so much nefarious things about this tax bill. It also [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=847.76s)]
*  cuts like 40 percent of homeowners assistance as well to low-income people. It's going to make [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=854.16s)]
*  millions of people homeless. It's going to take away health care for millions of people. But here's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=860.88s)]
*  HUD Secretary Scott Turner. Here's what he's got to say about it, too. And he's talking about, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=865.04s)]
*  you know, under this budget, I mean, literally, 40 percent of all rental assistants out the drain, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=870.48s)]
*  homeowners out the drain. I mean, Donald Trump's whole platform, the fraud was lower costs, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=876.8s)]
*  make housing more affordable. And of course, he's a fraud. He's a felon Trump. He's a sexual abuser. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=883.04s)]
*  He's a fraud. He's a liar. He's a criminal. Anyway, here, play this clip. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=888.64s)]
*  There should be new qualifications to receive the welfare benefits. You write able-bodied adults [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=892.88s)]
*  receiving benefits must work, participate in job training or volunteer in their communities [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=898.48s)]
*  at least 20 hours a week. So tell us about that. Is that a way to significantly cut back? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=903.28s)]
*  How can the administration enforce those policies to reshape the welfare system? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=910.72s)]
*  Well, Maria, I think it's a paradigm shift. You know, as well as I do, work restores dignity. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=916.08s)]
*  Work brings pride. You know, and our welfare system deviated from what it was intended to be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=921.52s)]
*  from its origin. It was intended for the most vulnerable to the most needy in our country. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  But now we've created welfare as a lifestyle in our country. And, you know, America is not a [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=932.24s)]
*  welfare state. America is a country of opportunity and a country of entrepreneurship. And so this [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=938.0s)]
*  will help us to encourage able-bodied people in America that are receiving government subsidies [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=943.92s)]
*  to work. You know, there was a study that came out almost 50% of households that are receiving [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=950.8s)]
*  HUD funds, almost 50%, not one person in that household is working. And that has to change that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=958.16s)]
*  culture. That paradigm has to change at HUD. This is common sense compassion. We want to help people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=965.04s)]
*  and invigorate and encourage people to work able-bodied people to work. We're not talking [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=971.92s)]
*  about the elderly. We're not talking about those that are disabled. Able-bodied, able-minded people [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=976.48s)]
*  that are receiving HUD funding should go to work to restore dignity. Maria, you get up early in the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=982.08s)]
*  morning and you work, you serve. And so we want to give other people and encourage others the same [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=988.72s)]
*  opportunity. And so this is a great step forward. Working with our colleagues at agriculture and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=993.6s)]
*  also Health and Human Services and Dr. Oz to be kind of a catalyst to change the trajectory of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  the lives of people in our country. I think it's a great point that you make, Secretary, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=1006.16s)]
*  because work is empowering. Well, there you have it, folks. We're going to keep you updated, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=1009.68s)]
*  but these are some major developments. Will Mike Johnson now lose his job? This bill has blown up [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_P4ZFV9evs&t=1013.76s)]
