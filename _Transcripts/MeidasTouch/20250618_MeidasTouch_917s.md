# Trump GOES SILENT as ALL HELL UNLEASHED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E)
*  So, after lighting the world on fire after his disastrous appearance at the G7, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=0.0s)]
*  was short-lived before he fled, after his disaster dictator parade, after the no-kings [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=6.72s)]
*  protests, but I guess most acutely and significantly right now with potentially war about to break [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=13.44s)]
*  out involving the United States in the Middle East, Donald Trump has gone silent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump called what's called a lid last night. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=27.36s)]
*  The White House called a travel photo lid, which means that Trump is not expected to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=31.88s)]
*  appear on camera or address the media in any way about what the hell is happening in the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=37.0s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=44.56s)]
*  Is America involved in a war right now involving Iran? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=46.06s)]
*  Are we committing our troops to another war in the Middle East? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=50.0s)]
*  What are the ramifications of that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=54.4s)]
*  Why did Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard say less than 90 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=57.44s)]
*  days ago under oath before Congress that Iran did not have nuclear capabilities and was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=63.04s)]
*  not pursuing nuclear weapons and all of a sudden that changed? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=68.8s)]
*  What is the latest intelligence we have? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=73.48s)]
*  What the hell is happening? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  And you know who also is not holding a press conference? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=77.8s)]
*  never held a press conference to date? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=81.48s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to address what in the world is going on right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump just reamed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth after the disastrous [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=91.76s)]
*  dictator parade. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  But look, Donald Trump is posting this while they have a lid at the White House while the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=99.4s)]
*  world is looking to see will the United States be committing troops to another war now in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump just posted. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=113.92s)]
*  It is my great honor to announce that I will be putting up two beautiful flagpoles on both [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  sides of the White House, North and South Lawns. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  It is a gift. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=124.4s)]
*  Gift is in caps for some reason from me of something which was always missing from the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  magnificent place. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=131.16s)]
*  The digging and placement of the poles will begin at 730 a.m. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=133.12s)]
*  Flag will be raised at 11 a.m. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=138.12s)]
*  These are the most magnificent poles made. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=140.12s)]
*  They are all tapered, rust-proof, rope inside the pole and of the highest quality. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully they will proudly stand at both sides of the White House for many years to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=149.8s)]
*  come. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=155.12s)]
*  You know, of all of the issues confronting our country right now, as war continues in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=156.12s)]
*  Ukraine after Russia's unlawful invasion and Trump was not able to negotiate peace [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=161.2s)]
*  in 24 hours, as he promised with prices going up, with the disastrous budget bill working [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=166.0s)]
*  its way through the Senate where they want to make additional cuts to Medicaid in the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=172.16s)]
*  Senate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=177.64s)]
*  We now hear from bipartisan, nonpartisan groups that the new version of the disastrous budget [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=178.64s)]
*  bill will cause a $20 trillion increase in our debt. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=184.88s)]
*  Inflation is only increasing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=191.04s)]
*  Mortgage rates are above 7%. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=193.12s)]
*  As all of that is going on, Donald Trump believes the biggest issue is flag poles. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=195.88s)]
*  We need two flag poles in the North and South Lawn of the White House. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=201.82s)]
*  That is Donald Trump's gift, everybody. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=206.28s)]
*  Oh, thank you, Donald. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  I was wondering, we need big giant flag poles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=209.76s)]
*  That's what we were looking for. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=212.96s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts the following. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=214.68s)]
*  $5 for MAGA? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=217.6s)]
*  Official memo from Trump? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=219.52s)]
*  Ben, I know I send you a lot of emails and I hate to take up even a moment of your valuable [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=221.08s)]
*  time, but this can't wait even a second longer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=226.56s)]
*  I just got sued by Gavin Newscombe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=229.84s)]
*  So here are three reasons to give $5 to show your support for me today. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=232.44s)]
*  One, I'm putting together a list of every supporter in your state who shows their support [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  for me right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=243.52s)]
*  Two, I've set a goal for rallying 1 million patriots to my cause. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=244.72s)]
*  None more important than you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=249.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Three, everyone who donates right now is entered to win the only set of Trump gold golf balls [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  available in the world. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=258.08s)]
*  That's Donald Trump right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=260.32s)]
*  $5 for MAGA? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=261.88s)]
*  $5 for MAGA, please? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=263.96s)]
*  Can I have $5 for MAGA? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=264.96s)]
*  I'll give you a big beautiful gold golf ball. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=267.08s)]
*  Can you? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=269.8s)]
*  This is what he's doing right now? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=271.16s)]
*  Absolute, absolute maniac. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=273.32s)]
*  I mean, you see it right there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, he did call into Jesse Waters last night. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=277.68s)]
*  This just in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=280.32s)]
*  As our editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski writes, Jesse Waters fantasizing about a massive penetrator. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=281.76s)]
*  Jesse Waters says, Justin, Trump says the Ayatollah can run, but he can't hide. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=288.88s)]
*  So Donald Trump's just using like movie cliches right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=295.68s)]
*  You could run, but you can't hide. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=300.32s)]
*  Stay tuned! [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=302.04s)]
*  Will we be sending our troops to war? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=304.04s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  And how about the fact that our constitutional safeguards and the War Powers Act actually [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  requires that Congress declare war? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=313.36s)]
*  Here's what Jesse Waters says. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=316.44s)]
*  Israel is begging the US to drop the massive penetrator on Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has been making all of these posts saying, we've done this to Iran. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  We, we, we. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  We're saying that the United States is essentially at war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's saying. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, again, let me be very clear and state my position. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  I think that Iran should absolutely never have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=338.88s)]
*  I think the Ayatollah is a cancer on what can otherwise be a great country if it was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  kind of restored and changed to what it looked like before the Ayatollah and in fact, went [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  more in a pro-democracy direction. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a lot of potential. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  I think the people are hungry for it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=361.0s)]
*  I also, as an American, I remember growing up and seeing all the same stuff they were [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=363.44s)]
*  saying about WMDs in Iraq. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=368.84s)]
*  So what happens when you do regime change in Iran? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=371.44s)]
*  Let's just say you get rid of the Ayatollah. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  You're going to declare mission accomplished, remove the Ayatollah, and then what? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=377.08s)]
*  Then we're going to have a civil war in Iran between factions aligned with the Shah's family [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=381.0s)]
*  in the United States and those aligned with the far, with the groups that are far more [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  extreme than even the Ayatollah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=394.88s)]
*  I mean, you realize you could turn that region into a massive civil war. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  Then what? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=402.2s)]
*  Then are we going to commit American troops? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=403.2s)]
*  Security troops are going to be on the ground. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=405.96s)]
*  You think that Iran wants to have Benjamin Netanyahu's pick to be the leader of Iran? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=407.68s)]
*  I guarantee you that they don't. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=412.64s)]
*  While all of this was going on, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, dog killer, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  cosplayer, she purported she was rushed to the hospital. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=421.32s)]
*  She went unconscious. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=424.46s)]
*  There was a very serious emergency. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=426.34s)]
*  They claimed that she had an allergic reaction to something and she's alert and recovering [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=428.46s)]
*  after passing out and going unconscious. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=434.16s)]
*  Maga Republican Senator Mike Lee wrote, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=437.04s)]
*  Prayers for Secretary Noem. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=441.0s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski goes, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=443.68s)]
*  Prayers for an allergic reaction, but mockery and hateful conspiracies for murder victims [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  who aren't in your tribe with no apology or remorse. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  Fake Christian small man, of course, Maga Republican Senator Mike Lee was mocking the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=459.28s)]
*  murders that took place in Minnesota by the assassin. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=465.23999999999995s)]
*  And he was mocking the situation and like laughing about it like the pathetic coward [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=469.84s)]

*  Folks, just looking at the data right now as well, home builder sentiment has cratered [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=477.08s)]
*  this year to the third lowest level since 2012. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=482.44s)]
*  Remember when Peter Navarro said 90 deals in 90 days were at day 67 and were at zero [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=487.16s)]
*  deals? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=493.48s)]
*  You may say, Ben, what about the UK? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=494.48s)]
*  Wasn't that a trade deal? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, the papers that I saw fall on the ground when Donald Trump was with Prime Minister [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=498.76000000000005s)]
*  Keir Starmer and Trump claimed he did a deal with the European Union. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=503.32000000000005s)]
*  First off, didn't have anything written on it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  At least I couldn't see anything written on it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  A trade deal is not three pages long. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=511.24s)]
*  They're hundreds of pages, if not thousands of pages. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=514.24s)]
*  And it just related to automobiles and aerospace or aeronautics. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  And the whole thing it did was give the United Kingdom preferential treatment for Rolls-Royce, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=523.84s)]
*  Jaguar and Land Rover over American car manufacturers because they would get a preferential tariff [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=529.44s)]
*  rate. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=537.4s)]
*  So that is not a deal to be celebrated. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=538.4s)]
*  And China was not a deal where we just caved, where Trump taco'd and he made 145% tariffs, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=542.28s)]
*  35% tariffs or 55% tariffs. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=548.92s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump said this back, what was it, 15 years ago at this point or [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  12 years ago when he said, Obama will start a war with Iran because he's stupid, play [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=557.4s)]
*  this clip. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  He's weak and he's ineffective. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  And fast forwarding, this is what Kristi Noem, our director of national intelligence, for [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=572.16s)]
*  better or worse, and I would say for much worse, she's the director of national intelligence. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=576.56s)]
*  She's Trump's pick. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=581.12s)]
*  She went before Congress less than 90 days ago. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  And here she is. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=585.36s)]
*  She says that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon, that they did not have the capabilities. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=586.9s)]
*  And that was the best assessment of our IC, our intelligence community, play this clip. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=593.7199999999999s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=598.28s)]
*  Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=602.88s)]
*  The IC continues to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=608.64s)]
*  program. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  May also be a significant issue though to the director of national intelligence that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  the White House personnel director, Sergio Gore, skipped the background check for himself. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=619.6s)]
*  His colleagues question, who the hell is this guy? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=627.66s)]
*  Where is he from? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=630.14s)]
*  He claims to be from Malta. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=631.26s)]
*  There's no record of him being from Malta. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=633.4599999999999s)]
*  He's responsible for vetting 4,000 administrative administration appointees. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  He didn't submit the most basic form, the SF-86 form, which begins the security clearance [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=641.36s)]
*  process. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=647.3399999999999s)]
*  And he's been saying, oh, the deep state says that I can't submit it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=648.3399999999999s)]

*  The deep state's going to come after me. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=654.14s)]
*  Back to New York Post for breaking that story. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=655.94s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, can someone please ask Caroline Levitt, the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=658.7600000000001s)]

*  to say what country he is from and refuses to complete the most basic paperwork for a [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=668.9000000000001s)]
*  background check? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=674.22s)]
*  Can you also go ask if Sergio Gore is the name on his birth certificate? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=675.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=679.82s)]
*  Seems a bit important. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=681.1s)]
*  Also seems important when we look at this photo from the G7's second day working session [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=682.98s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=688.94s)]
*  Of course, the first day had the immediate countries in the G7, like the US and Canada [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=690.26s)]

*  Look at this photo. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=717.94s)]
*  Donald Trump not there. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=719.3000000000001s)]

*  Donald Trump was asked yesterday, he reached out to Governor Walz to say anything about [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=747.26s)]
*  the assassinations that were taking place in Minnesota. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=752.62s)]
*  Governor Walz was on the list as a target of the assassination, as was about 70 other [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=756.6999999999999s)]

*  Have you called the governor yet or been able to speak to any of them? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=770.46s)]
*  I don't really call him. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=772.9000000000001s)]

*  You know, and I think that's significant because, you know, especially as we also head into [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdvUtk8B-_E&t=786.38s)]
