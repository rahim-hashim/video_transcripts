# Trump CANâ€™T ESCAPE his PAST as he TRIES TO HIDE FILES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig)
*  I know with all of the devastation and destruction Donald Trump has caused in the United States and the world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=0.0s)]
*  it can be easy to forget all of his broken promises. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Like, I'm sure you remember his broken promise that he would bring down prices on day one, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=8.6s)]
*  but he's now caused prices to rise, or he said he would make housing more affordable. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=14.16s)]
*  Housing is less affordable. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=19.16s)]
*  He said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours or even before he took office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=20.52s)]
*  And of course, he's made things worse there, and he just whines about it now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=25.04s)]
*  But you also remember the promise that he made that he was going to release certain files. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=29.6s)]
*  Remember those? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Maybe Donald Trump was hoping that in all of the chaos and destruction and market crashes and economic crashes, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  we'd forget that we would just not report about it anymore. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=42.88s)]
*  Sorry, Donald. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=46.28s)]
*  The Midas Touch Network, where are the media now? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  And you know who brought up those files, Donald? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=50.56s)]
*  You know the ones I'm talking about. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=53.6s)]
*  Nancy Mace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=55.76s)]
*  Maga Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace at a hearing three days ago this week. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=57.12s)]
*  Here is what she said. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=63.8s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Right before our eyes, and they are doing this in real time with regards to the Epstein list, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=65.84s)]
*  which the government still has not released today, and the American people deserve to know [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=74.08s)]
*  who rich and powerful is on that list and who the government is covering up for. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=78.0s)]
*  So for decades. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=86.52s)]
*  I could think of someone whose name is on that list. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=87.4s)]
*  Aha! [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=91.2s)]
*  It's on the list right there, Donald. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=92.8s)]
*  There's your name. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=94.72s)]
*  That's on Jeffrey Epstein's phone number list of the people whose numbers he had on his Rolodex. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=96.28s)]
*  That was already released in connection with some of the other cases that he was involved in. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  Oh, there you are again, Donald. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=110.08s)]
*  On the flight logs, your name appears on the Epstein Jets flight logs at least seven times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  What's that, Donald? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=118.72s)]
*  Is that your name on deposition transcripts where some of the women that Epstein trafficked [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  went to hotels and casinos that you owned, and the women who were trafficked talked about that in depositions? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  Oh wait, wait a minute, Donald. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=133.76s)]
*  At Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial for sex trafficking on behalf of Epstein, where she [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=136.2s)]
*  was found guilty and basically put in jail for the rest of her life, a lady who was a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=141.32s)]
*  girl at the time who was 14 years old said that Epstein introduced her to you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=146.92s)]
*  She goes by a Jane Doe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=153.68s)]
*  Oh wait a minute, Donald. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=155.44s)]
*  You appear to be everywhere on what's already been released over and over again. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=157.04s)]
*  So what about in the files that you said you were going to release? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=162.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi, your attorney general, she's made 5,000 appearances on Fox. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=166.72s)]
*  But in terms of the new Epstein files released? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=174.36s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=177.36s)]
*  New Epstein prosecutions? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  Zero. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=180.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, what about fraud prosecutions from Doge? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=181.4s)]
*  Zero. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=184.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, Donald. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=185.24s)]
*  campaign? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=188.72s)]
*  Weren't you flying around in Epstein's jet as well? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=190.2s)]
*  Yeah, the jet that Epstein flew around in before he died under, let's just call it unusual [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=194.2s)]
*  circumstances during the first Trump administration period. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=199.84s)]
*  Remember when Epstein passed away, died, his plane was then auctioned off or sold, and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=206.2s)]
*  then that individual, then I guess that company gave you access to the same jet to fly around [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=213.76s)]
*  for the 2024 campaign? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=220.48s)]
*  That's pretty ghoulish, Donald. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=223.0s)]
*  That's out of all the planes in the world you want to fly around in that Gulfstream [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=224.44s)]
*  right there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=228.56s)]
*  Oh, and is this a statement that you made, Donald, back to the New York Magazine in 2002? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=229.56s)]
*  I've known Jeff for 15 years, terrific guy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=237.28s)]
*  He's a lot of fun to be with. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=241.2s)]
*  He's even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=242.68s)]
*  younger side. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  So Nancy Mace, MAGA Republicans, where are the Epstein files? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  Release the Epstein files. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=256.16s)]
*  What are you worried about? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=258.72s)]
*  What are you scared about? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=260.64s)]
*  Well, let's hear Jeffrey Epstein in his own words when he spoke to author Michael Wolff [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  when he was meeting with Michael Wolff, an author, a biographer about potentially, when [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=270.4s)]
*  Epstein was still alive, about potentially writing a biography for Epstein. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=276.32s)]
*  Here are some of the things that Epstein said about Donald. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=282.56s)]
*  This is Epstein talking to Michael Wolff. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=284.96s)]
*  This is Epstein's voice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=287.48s)]
*  Listen to what he said, play this clip. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=289.52s)]
*  Charming. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  He is able to convince people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  He tells everybody what they want to hear. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=295.12s)]
*  So how do you know this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=298.2s)]
*  I think Donald's close to straight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=299.8s)]
*  He has a sense of humor. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=301.84s)]
*  He can be funny. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=303.32s)]
*  He's right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=304.32s)]
*  His ability to sell. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=305.32s)]
*  It's very much like Clinton. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=308.56s)]
*  Both Bill and Donald have the ability to go over to a fat, ugly woman. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=310.12s)]
*  So you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=316.28s)]
*  So you probably thought he had a scouting reduction. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=319.12s)]
*  You see that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=322.52s)]
*  You say, you know how to do more with a real hat. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=323.52s)]
*  There's not even a horrible human being. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=326.72s)]
*  He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends' wives. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  And when he first tries to gain their trust, then he uses it to do bad things. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=334.68s)]
*  That's how he does. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Now I had the opportunity to speak to Michael Wolff, the author who you heard in those audio [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=343.56s)]
*  transcripts. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  Wolff spent a lot of time with Epstein when Epstein talked about Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=350.44000000000005s)]
*  Let's hear from Wolff in his own words. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=355.56s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=357.56s)]
*  And he sat for many, many hours of discussion with me. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, certainly 80, 90, probably 100 hours I have of Epstein on tape. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=365.32s)]
*  And one of the discussions, because this was occurring, Trump became the president in 2017. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=373.4s)]
*  I began writing about Trump. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=383.36s)]
*  And so we spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump and Epstein's relationship with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump, which went on for a good certainly 15 years and was incredibly close. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=393.96s)]
*  They were each other's closest friend for a very long time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=400.28s)]
*  And Epstein, I think Epstein is one of those people who truly knew Donald Trump, knew many [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=407.28s)]
*  secrets about Donald Trump and was threatening to Donald Trump. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=416.08s)]
*  My cat is part of the family, plain and simple. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  So I want them to have the best food that money can buy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  And I didn't realize that for years, the cat food that I was buying had questionable ingredients. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  This podcast is sponsored by Smalls. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=433.11999999999995s)]
*  Now, if you're a listener of the show, you know that my cat cannot live without Smalls. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=435.4s)]

*  Smalls cat food is protein packed recipes made with preservative free ingredients that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=446.08s)]

*  And my cats prefer Smalls way more than their previous cat food. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=460.72s)]
*  I legitimately did a taste test, put two bowls side by side and they immediately went [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=464.52s)]
*  to Smalls. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  Since making the switch to Smalls, my cat has had fewer hairballs, more balanced energy, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  a healthier weight, a softer and shinier fur coat, and a less stinky litter box that's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=475.52s)]

*  While Buzzfeed said, my cats went completely ballistic for this stuff. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  My cat's breath is much better and their fur is much softer ever since I switched to Smalls. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=493.8s)]
*  Smalls also has a bunch of amazing treats and snacks that you can add to your order. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=499.68s)]
*  And after switching to Smalls, 88% of cat owners reported overall health improvements. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=503.72s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=509.48s)]

*  Now, why don't I share with you this clip that MSNBC put together about Trump's relationship [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  with Epstein. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=562.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  We're going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=567.28s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=583.3s)]
*  in front of him. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=588.26s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other man and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=589.6999999999999s)]
*  telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=594.62s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=598.52s)]
*  their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=603.28s)]
*  there, she's hot. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=609.64s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=614.16s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=620.56s)]
*  Interestingly, Sean Hannity recently said on Fox to his audience that the Epstein list, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=626.02s)]
*  if it's ever released, people should not rush to judgment because a lot of famous people [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  hang out with Epstein and just because you hang out with people, he said, isn't a big [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=639.92s)]
*  deal. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=644.92s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=645.92s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi released phase one of the Epstein files. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=647.92s)]
*  That's transparency. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of names in there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=652.36s)]
*  And Epstein was obviously a star chaser who wanted to hang out with people that are famous, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  people with money. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=659.9799999999999s)]
*  So let me be very clear at the start here, and I said this on my radio show today, people, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=660.9799999999999s)]
*  because they're in the Rolodex, they're on the list, does not mean they did anything [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=665.0999999999999s)]
*  wrong. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=669.36s)]
*  On this show, and we have done it over and over again, we don't rush to judgment. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  I believe in the presumption of innocence and I am appealing to people not to rush [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=674.08s)]
*  to judgment, even though these names are now public information. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=680.2s)]
*  There are names that I'm certain were not involved or knowledgeable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  I could be certain of it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  Among the documents are flight logs in which President Donald Trump is named several times. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=688.48s)]
*  According to the records, Trump flew on Epstein's private jets repeatedly back in the 1990s. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=693.32s)]
*  Now, this isn't new information as it had previously been made public. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=698.84s)]
*  Well, that's from Sean Hannity right there. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=704.08s)]
*  And I want you to listen to this. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=709.12s)]
*  This is when Donald Trump was interviewed by Fox several months ago. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=710.96s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said when he was asked about the Epstein files. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=717.6s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=720.72s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=721.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=723.72s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=724.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=726.72s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=727.72s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=731.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=732.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=733.0s)]
*  I think less so because you don't know. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=734.92s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because there's [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=737.64s)]
*  a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=740.48s)]
*  But I think I would. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=744.4s)]
*  Are you sensing a pattern here? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=745.92s)]
*  Are you sensing a pattern here? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=749.16s)]
*  By the way, I mean, just think about what Donald Trump did with his wealth in the early [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=751.96s)]
*  1990s. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=757.12s)]
*  Like, it's gross. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=758.12s)]
*  It's gross, right? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=760.0s)]
*  Just think about you have all the money from your dad, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=761.4s)]
*  That's where he got all his money from his dad, a lot of money from his dad. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=764.6s)]
*  And so he spends the money to do beauty pageants for girls. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=768.08s)]
*  He did beauty pageants. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=772.6s)]
*  He did, like, beauty pageants for women. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=773.6s)]
*  But he also did these, like, teen beauty pageants. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=775.68s)]
*  And then, like, here's one that was at his hotel from Look of the Year, 1991. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=778.76s)]
*  These are, like, little girls at his events. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=786.08s)]
*  And then the girls went on a yacht in New York and Trump was photographed with the girls. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=790.36s)]
*  You see the photograph here? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=795.92s)]
*  Donald Trump with contestants at 1991's elite Look of the Year. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=797.72s)]
*  Look at him looking at these girls. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=802.88s)]
*  They went on a yacht together. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=805.5600000000001s)]
*  This yacht trip was well documented with other old men who were old enough to be the women's [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=807.52s)]
*  grandfathers. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=812.6s)]
*  That was talked about in an article in The Guardian. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=814.6s)]
*  Some real gross stuff. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, here's a flashback to 2005 where Donald Trump bragged to Howard Stern [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=818.92s)]
*  about how he would go backstage during a Miss USA pageant when the young contestants were [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=824.7199999999999s)]
*  naked. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=830.56s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=831.56s)]
*  What you could also say is the owner of the pageant, it's your obligation to do that? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=832.56s)]
*  So you have done that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=836.8s)]
*  Tell me what- [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=837.8s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=838.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=841.4s)]
*  And everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else and, you know, no men are [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=842.4s)]
*  anywhere. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=844.92s)]
*  And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=845.92s)]
*  it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=849.4s)]
*  You know, I'm inspecting. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=850.4s)]
*  I want to make sure that everything is good. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=851.4s)]
*  You're like a doctor. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=852.4s)]
*  You're there. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=853.4s)]
*  Is everyone okay? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=854.4s)]
*  You know, they're standing there with no clothes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=855.4s)]
*  Is everybody okay? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=856.4s)]
*  And you see these incredible looking women. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=857.4s)]
*  And so I sort of get away with things like that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=859.16s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is, you know, look, I know with the market crashing, with our [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  alliances being destroyed, with Trump threatening Canada, threatening invading Canada and all [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=867.76s)]
*  these things. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=873.88s)]
*  You know, look, I've said it before and I'll say it again. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=874.88s)]
*  Let me not mince words here. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=877.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's a sexual predator. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's a felon. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=880.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's a fraud. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=882.36s)]
*  Let me repeat that again. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=884.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is a sexual predator. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=886.04s)]
*  He was found liable of sexual assault. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=888.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is a fraud. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=891.4s)]
*  He was found liable of fraud. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=893.38s)]
*  Lying about his business valuations. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=896.32s)]
*  Sounds shocking to you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=898.84s)]
*  Kind of like how he just makes up tariff numbers. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=901.2s)]
*  Oh my God, the guy who lies about things and makes up numbers, engages in fraud. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=903.36s)]
*  Oh my God, really? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  What a shocker right there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=909.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is a felon. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=911.72s)]
*  Donald Trump was convicted in a criminal case by a unanimous jury for business records fraud. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=913.84s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump also took national secrets when he was citizen Trump to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=920.12s)]
*  Classified information, potentially nuclear secrets. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=925.9200000000001s)]
*  So is it shocking that the people in his regime are sending classified information over Gmail [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=929.36s)]
*  and signal text threats? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=936.36s)]
*  No, this is all very predictable stuff. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=938.0s)]
*  I'll leave you with this too. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=941.6s)]
*  How sick and demented he is. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=944.2s)]
*  So back about a year ago, a year and a half ago, he gave a speech in front of young Republicans, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=946.52s)]
*  high school kids, college kids, young Republicans, high school kids, college kids, young. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=953.52s)]
*  And he was keynoting the speech. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=959.68s)]
*  And he told the kids that the most courageous thing he had ever done in his life, according [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=963.24s)]
*  to a general, said it was the most courageous thing he saw. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=972.24s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump said that he grabs women by their genitals without their consent? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=976.04s)]
*  Remember how that was on that Access Hollywood tape? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=981.56s)]
*  Well, remember when Donald Trump called it locker room talk? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=983.72s)]
*  He said it's locker room talk. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=987.76s)]
*  And that's he said that's how men talk. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=990.0s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=991.48s)]
*  That's how disgusting people like you talk. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=992.48s)]
*  And I'm in talk. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=995.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=996.04s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=998.16s)]
*  But anyway, Donald Trump told the young Republicans that he was told that was the most courageous [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=999.16s)]
*  thing he did calling that locker room talk. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1004.88s)]
*  Here he is in his own words. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1007.88s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1009.12s)]
*  But I went on to that stage just a few days later. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1010.12s)]
*  And a general who's a fantastic general actually said to me, sir, I've been on the battlefield. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1015.0s)]
*  Men have gone down on my left and on my right. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1020.88s)]
*  I stood on hills where soldiers were killed. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1022.96s)]
*  But I believe the bravest thing I've ever seen was the night you went on to that stage [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1026.44s)]
*  with Hillary Clinton after what happened. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1030.32s)]
*  And then that woman asked you the first question about it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1034.16s)]
*  And I said, locker room talk. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1037.8s)]
*  It's locker room talk. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1040.8400000000001s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  What are you talking? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1042.8400000000001s)]
*  Lacker room talk. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1044.72s)]
*  That was not a great... [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1047.4399999999998s)]
*  So we're dealing with a sick, demented, twisted sexual predator. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1050.72s)]
*  That's who we're dealing with here. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1058.6s)]
*  And so, you know, it is shocking to me how corporate news has normalized this behavior. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  This isn't normal. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1072.48s)]
*  It's not funny. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1073.96s)]
*  You know, and when I see stuff like that, it makes me just extra dedicated to do more [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1075.04s)]
*  videos to grow this media network bigger because what the hell is that? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1082.08s)]
*  And no, we're not going to stop reporting about the Epstein list. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1090.32s)]
*  I'm going to come with receipts all the time here. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGPG3Jwiig&t=1095.16s)]
