# GOP Leaders GO NUTS as Trump DESTROYS Economy
**MeidasTouch:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0)

[[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=37.72s)]
*  Yeah that's that's real I mean she's really a state legislator senator state senator from Arizona. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  I will go to DC how about Maga Republican Senator Jim Banks who says we all knew this was going to be disruptive that's what we wanted the goal of this is what we promised you disruption pain suffering so this is a win this is actually what Maga Republican Senator Jim Banks is saying. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=69.72s)]
*  That these other countries are already coming to the table and this is what's brilliant about what President Trump is up to he's put other countries on notice you're not going to take advantage of us anymore they're already reacting Canada and Mexico is begging President Trump to come to the table and negotiate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=87.68s)]
*  Their tariffs down and do away with our tariffs to we know this is going to be disruptive but there's a silver lining and good news in the midst of all of it and as you said this happening right in my hometown. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=104.72s)]
*  At a General Motors plant that's going to pay more in overtime and create hundreds of new temporary hopefully permanent jobs and make more cars in America because General Motors a great American company. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  Actually makes less cars that they sell in the US than Toyota Honda or Subaru dues. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=128.52s)]
*  We're seeing massive GDP contraction massive layoffs in factories were the opposite of what he said up is down down is up when it comes to these Maga Republicans I at least give. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=134.8s)]
*  I'm even saying this Ron Johnson from Wisconsin a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of credit at least he says I'm concerned about what's happening right now at least there's a modicum of saying something semi accurate on Fox listen to this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=147.48s)]
*  Surplus but we're 2 trillion dollars away from balancing the budget so. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=163.04s)]
*  If for my standpoint I'm certainly concerned about what's happening right now in the markets and I hope the administration is looking at as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=168.12s)]
*  The Democrats. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=176.52s)]
*  Let's talk about what the people are saying right here this from cap action speaking to small business and families across the country let's play it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=178.04s)]
*  So Trump just destroyed my business Trump announced his massive tax plan on items coming from other countries he says that the countries are going to pay that that's false it's the person bringing it in and I own a small business. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  I wonder what our grocery bill is going to be like I wonder if we can afford to upgrade our car when it breaks down all those things are on my mind I think it's really going to hurt our pocketbook. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=200.68s)]
*  Terrible so freaking kill me man we're start up we are American entrepreneurs we got our life savings in this we got a loan we are trying to make it happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=211.08s)]
*  But we don't have the option to get this product made anywhere else not really we've looked into it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=221.4s)]
*  Right now we're under serious strain from tariffs especially on aluminum most of our beer is put in cans and our aluminum prices have increased 17% this calendar year and are expected to grow even higher. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=227.56s)]
*  Let's bring in executive director of swing left Yasmin Rogers been the executive director since 2022 Yasmin you run an organization people powered million people across the country chapters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=241.88s)]
*  Across the United States I've been fortunate enough to be invited to speak at a lot of them here in California what are you hearing from your membership in your different chapters right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=256.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on Ben and being such a longtime friend of swing lefts million members around the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=266.96s)]
*  You know I think this has been a week of a lot of emotional ups and downs as you can imagine yesterday's economic hit as you know you covered really thoughtfully just now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=274.08s)]
*  Is really scary for folks right and our volunteers and our grassroots donors are people who have small businesses and have families and have car payments and have mortgages and so. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  The weight of this week is significant as you know really every week in this administration has been sort of overwhelming and at the same time this has been a week of a lot of real hope. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=298.92s)]
*  And a feeling like we have entered a new and more hopeful political paradigm and that's because you know, as you know, the Wisconsin Supreme Court election was this Tuesday night. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Or was this Tuesday and the results were called pretty early in the evening, which was exciting because what they showed was a full throated victory for the liberal justice on that court. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=324.11999999999995s)]
*  And that's really, really important because not only does that mean Wisconsin now has a liberal majority or keeps a liberal majority on its court. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=336.92s)]
*  It also means that we're setting the stage for the ability to draw a fair lines for critical house districts and to have free and fair elections in Wisconsin and of course so many other issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=346.88s)]
*  And then we also saw other amazingly hopeful results in some of the deepest red turf in Florida with two districts house districts that we knew were unwinnable. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=358.76s)]
*  We saw incredible double digit Democratic over performance and you know, as you well know, Republicans are running really scared of everything that you showed in those clips earlier. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Shows what we are all feeling, which is that Donald Trump made a series of pretty effective lies over the course of the twenty twenty four election telling people that if they voted for him, he'd bring prices down. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=383.04s)]
*  And what we saw yesterday and it's sort of surreal that he called it a day of liberation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  It was really a day of real hamstringing of our economy and of people's lives. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  Folks are not just thinking, oh, shoot, maybe we made the wrong decision. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=407.16s)]
*  Folks are organizing in astronomical numbers around the country and Wisconsin and Florida were just the beginning signs of the electoral consequences of of what Trump is doing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=411.04s)]
*  But we're also seeing, you know, Republicans, independents, voters, Democratic voters who stayed home the cycle, showing up at town halls and organizing and at swing left. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=424.2s)]
*  You know, we've got, as you mentioned, a million members and about 400 groups all around the country led by volunteers. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  And we are seeing levels of enthusiasm, not just in Wisconsin this week, but all across the country for folks to start really getting involved in in the fight ahead. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  And we just launched this week our campaign called Three to Win, which is anchored on the number three, which is the three districts that we need to win to flip the house. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm talking about that here in response to your question around energy, because I think folks are both really pissed off and really worried about things like what Trump is doing to wreak havoc on our economy. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=468.92s)]
*  And they want to do something, but they're not really sure what they can do. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=481.84s)]
*  That doesn't just, you know, feel like they're blowing off steam, but feels like it is meaningful and it can put an actual check on Donald Trump, Elon Musk and on the MAGA agenda. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=485.92s)]
*  And winning the house is that fight. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=496.08s)]
*  And we, as we saw in Wisconsin, as we saw in Florida, there's enthusiasm, there's energy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=498.08s)]
*  We've got to point it in the right direction. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=503.08s)]
*  We're only three seats away from winning the house. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=505.24s)]
*  And if folks organize starting now, including in your backyard in California, in my backyard here in the in the D.C. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=507.8s)]
*  area and in all sorts of even really blue parts of the country, most of us live within 90 minutes of a competitive swing district. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=515.4s)]
*  We only need to win three of them to win back a house majority. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=524.44s)]
*  And that's only seven thousand three hundred nine votes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=527.64s)]
*  That's smaller than a Texas football game, smaller than a concert in L.A. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  And we can do that. And that really is going to put a meaningful check on an agenda that is deeply, deeply, deeply unpopular, as your clips earlier showed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=535.8s)]
*  You know, I think these protests that we're seeing, like the hands off protests this weekend, are growing in strength. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=546.56s)]
*  We're seeing the coordination of labor unions, people powered movements all together. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=553.8s)]
*  These protests are growing in strength. They're growing in size. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=559.48s)]
*  I predicted we're going to have what's going to be known as a summer of democracy or democracy summer. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  So on the one hand, you have these protests. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=568.36s)]
*  Now, one of the things that I love about Swing Left is you say in our backyards, we have these events there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=570.5200000000001s)]
*  They're literally sometimes these events are held in people's backyards. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=577.44s)]
*  And so the different chapters hold events in their backyards where they draft postcards and they do canvassing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  together and just exchange ideas. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=588.84s)]
*  And, you know, someone will be the designated person in a specific town to host that at their house this time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=591.96s)]
*  And then it's their house this time. And they bring in good food. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=598.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's a fun way to have civic engagement with people and to take the concepts that we talk about here in the digital world, bring it into the real world and and be warm and welcoming and empathetic. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=601.32s)]
*  And so that was my experience going to these events. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=615.84s)]
*  And so let people know where they want to join a Swing Left chapter or start a Swing Left chapter or be a part of one. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=618.2s)]
*  What does that look like? What do they do if they see those clips at the beginning of the MAGA people selling Trump sneakers or whatever? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  And the MAGA Republicans said, you know what, I'm going somewhere. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=634.88s)]
*  Where do they go? What do they do? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=639.36s)]
*  That's you framed it exactly right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=641.2s)]
*  First of all, folks can go to swingleft.org slash house and they can get involved today in the fight to win back the house. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=643.88s)]
*  They can join, as you said, a local group because, you know, it's we're 18 months away from this election. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=652.12s)]
*  So what we're not looking for is to just have folks do one click and then, you know, move on with their lives. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  Of course, if folks want to do one click, they'll be able to donate to the highest impact races. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=666.04s)]
*  They'll be able to get involved in that one click. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=671.68s)]
*  But a lot of folks, as you said, you know, digital fatigue is really real. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=675.12s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons why your show is growing in its popularity is that we all gather online. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. We read, we engage with content online. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=685.4s)]
*  We text our friends and DM our friends online. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=688.76s)]
*  But we all also have an appetite for real human conversation and engagement. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=692.44s)]
*  And so all of that online engagement, whether that's listening to shows like yours, whether that's going to swing left or it ultimately needs to have people have more to talk about when they're gathered together at dinner, find ways to connect. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=698.04s)]
*  And if we're in an 18 month fight to win back the house and then we're going to have two years before the next presidential election. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=712.08s)]
*  And then after that, we're going to have a lot of work to do to rebuild our economy and our country, given all the damage that Donald Trump and Elon Musk have already done. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=718.96s)]
*  We've got to do that in a way where we are well trained for the marathon ahead. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  And our vantage point is we need to be really strong online and meet each other there. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=732.12s)]
*  And in order to really build those muscles for the marathon ahead, we have to engage offline. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=736.64s)]
*  And so when folks go to swing left dot org slash house, they can sign up to join a swing left gathering in the community that they are closest to wherever they are in the country. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  And whether or not there's a gathering already scheduled in your home turf, folks can host a gathering of their own. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  And that might be opening your doors, whether at your home or at a coffee shop or a park or whatever the case may be to others that you might not know yet. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  Or whether it's getting your existing community, a book club, your group of friends that you wish you saw a little bit more. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=769.5200000000001s)]
*  This is not just it's actually very strategically important for us to spend some time slowing down offline as we engage also in this very fast moving digital media landscape. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  Both so that we've got the strong muscle for the marathon ahead, but also because something I've observed a lot as we're getting feedback from volunteers and donors in this really, really challenging moment for our country. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=789.36s)]
*  Is that folks are also feeling things outside of our politics that are impacting them. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=800.96s)]
*  And that's a real sense of loneliness, of isolation, of fracture. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=805.88s)]
*  You know, these are things that Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, you know, Biden's Surgeon General in the last administration, called the top public health crisis in this country. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  And so at Swing Left, we are all about what are the highest impact actions that folks can take to make a material difference in shifting the balance of power for Democrats. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  So we've got a fighting chance on fighting for an economy that works for all, for a democracy that thrives, for a country that we can be proud of that lives up to our values. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=831.36s)]
*  But in that process, we've got to do it in a way that grows our connection. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=840.2800000000001s)]
*  And if folks get involved again at swingleft.org, my hope is that they're not just having a big impact. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=845.32s)]
*  They're also driving meaning from that impact and sinking their teeth into a political strategy that even if they are brand new to politics and they've never done anything besides listening to news and listening to great shows like yours, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=851.88s)]
*  they've never turned that into action yet that they can get involved. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=864.24s)]
*  And the vast majority of folks are much stronger political leaders than they know. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=867.56s)]
*  And our job is to hold a mirror to them and also offer them the on ramps to really high impact opportunities that, again, will shift the balance of power, which we can do. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=873.88s)]
*  We're only three seats away from doing that in that one of one of the most critical levers of government, which is the House of Representatives. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=884.04s)]
*  Yeah, I always get asked from our viewers, well, what can I do now? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=891.2800000000001s)]
*  What can I do? I think this is a step that you can take. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  Go to the website, take a look at what chapters are nearby. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  Think about starting your own chapter and then share the photos and videos online. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=902.76s)]
*  Tag us. I'm sure there's a place where people can post the photos and share the ideas they'll get to me. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=907.8000000000001s)]
*  And Midas will do our best to also kind of share what's going on out there in the field. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=914.6800000000001s)]
*  Now's the time to start. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=918.9599999999999s)]
*  And so I thought it's important to highlight all of that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZ3CWJaki0&t=920.1999999999999s)]
