# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump’s Plan BACKFIRES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8)
*  All hell is breaking loose in cities across the United States of America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=0.0s)]
*  particularly cities in blue states, that Donald Trump is unleashing war against. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=6.0s)]
*  Car washes, home depot parking lots, swap meets are being invaded by masked ICE agents [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  and potentially bounty hunters who have been deputized as ICE agents, correction officers deputized as ICE agents, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=23.0s)]
*  targeting hard-working migrants, beating them, attacking them, making them disappear. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=33.0s)]
*  And we're seeing how others in the community are observing what ICE is doing, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=41.0s)]
*  standing up against ICE and they're getting this all on tape as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=47.0s)]
*  I want to highlight some examples over the past just 48 hours or so. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=53.0s)]
*  I want to give a shout out to Brittany Mejia over at the Los Angeles Times. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=59.0s)]
*  I think she's doing a great job reporting on this as well. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=64.0s)]
*  She spoke to an individual named Job Garcia, a United States citizen who was arrested by border patrol agents [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=67.0s)]
*  outside a home depot in Hollywood. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=76.0s)]
*  Here's what Job Garcia heard them say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=79.0s)]
*  How many bodies did you guys grab today? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=82.0s)]
*  Oh, we grabbed 31. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=85.0s)]
*  Oh, what a good day. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=88.0s)]
*  High five. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=90.0s)]
*  Talking about hard-working migrants, people who have lived here in many cases for decades, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=91.0s)]
*  who are now ripped apart from their family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=99.0s)]
*  And before doing that, physically ripped, thrown to the ground, beaten, beaten ruthlessly [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=102.0s)]
*  by these disgusting ICE agents, the American Gestapo. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=109.0s)]
*  It's on tape. It's being filmed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=113.0s)]
*  I'll show you Job Garcia shared this video he took shortly before his arrest. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=116.0s)]
*  You'll see the ICE agents going to a truck driver. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=122.0s)]
*  Boom, they bang the windshield. They grab the truck driver. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=125.0s)]
*  And the truck driver, Job Garcia, is like, what the F are you doing? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=129.0s)]
*  So just a warning. The language here, lots of cursing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=132.0s)]
*  There's a lot of physical. You're going to see violence here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=136.0s)]
*  We can't look away from this, though. We have to know this is happening. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=139.0s)]
*  I know with Donald Trump provoking and escalating wars overseas and all of the things that Trump is doing, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=143.0s)]
*  he wants to distract from the fact that he has a Gestapo like the Nazis going through the United States [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=151.0s)]
*  in doing this here. Play this clip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=157.0s)]
*  Give me your fucking hand. You want it? You got it, sir. You fucking got it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=187.0s)]
*  You want to go to jail? Fine. You got it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=195.0s)]
*  Horrible, horrible stuff here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=202.0s)]
*  Pablo Manriquez posted the following employees and bystanders at Salgado Tire Service in Pico Rivera, California, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=205.0s)]
*  run an immigration agent off their property for harassing their workers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=215.0s)]
*  As Adrian Carrasquillo explains, they don't want the attention for what they're doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=220.0s)]
*  These ICE agents and those deputized as such, they don't want anyone to know who they are. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=227.0s)]
*  And that's why they're masked. They don't want videos like this out there. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=233.0s)]
*  We've seen multiple examples of too much attention and light flushing them out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=238.0s)]
*  So let us use our platform here at the Midas Touch Network with over 5 million subscribers to be that light. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=244.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=253.0s)]
*  You guys don't have to talk. You guys don't have to talk. You guys do not have to answer any questions. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=254.0s)]
*  No questions at all. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=261.0s)]
*  What's your badge number? What's your badge number actually? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=264.0s)]
*  What's your last name? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=269.0s)]

*  What's your badge number last name? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=275.0s)]

*  I'll be quiet until he leaves. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=298.0s)]
*  Next, I want to show you this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=325.0s)]
*  A brave woman stopping a kidnapping by these individuals who claim that they are ICE agents. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=334.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people claim they're deputized as ICE agents. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=343.0s)]
*  And this is from a car wash also in the area as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=347.0s)]
*  Same area. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=352.0s)]
*  And you'll hear her say, this is f'ing kidnapping. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=353.0s)]
*  That's not your badge. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=356.0s)]
*  I do have a little bit of an education. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=358.0s)]
*  Get the f out of here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=360.0s)]

*  It is like ice with freaking out of shape, fat asses. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=527.0s)]

*  in a community where ICE agents are there daily in those clips that I'm showing you. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=1074.68s)]
*  The ICE agents are going to those home depots. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=1081.68s)]
*  Those ICE agents are targeting and attacking people in my wife's neighborhood. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=1083.68s)]
*  My wife's mother is a United States citizen, as are all of my wife's family members. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JftzKkYQYg8&t=1088.68s)]
