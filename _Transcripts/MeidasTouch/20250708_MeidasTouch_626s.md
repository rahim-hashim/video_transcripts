# Trump’s OWN Top Advisor DESTROYS HIM for HIDING FILES
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w)
*  Donald Trump's top supporters are absolutely losing it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=0.0s)]
*  They say they feel utterly betrayed that Trump's DOJ is now saying that the Epstein list and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=3.84s)]
*  the Epstein files just simply don't exist. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=10.16s)]
*  Epstein never kept a list where he blackmailed rich men. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the fact that Donald Trump and Epstein were like the closest of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  friends and Trump said that Epstein's a great guy who likes women on the younger side. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=21.92s)]
*  The list never exists according to the Trump regime, which claimed over and over again [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=26.96s)]
*  that the list did exist, that it was on the desk of Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=32.0s)]
*  I want to show you some of these reactions, including from Donald Trump's top legal advisor, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=37.0s)]
*  by the way, in typical Trumpian fashion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Trump's top legal advisor, Tom Fitton, is not actually a licensed lawyer, but he's one [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=46.36s)]
*  of the people who have given Donald Trump a lot of legal advice over the years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=52.76s)]
*  And Fitton says, I don't know how to even respond to this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=58.32s)]
*  This is some of the worst. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=62.08s)]
*  This is like the worst cover up ever. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=63.56s)]
*  I'm going to show you that in a moment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=65.52s)]
*  I want to share with you though as well that Trump supporters are taking to the comments [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=67.28s)]
*  section on Fox and on Trump's social media platform to show how upset they are at Donald [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=72.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=79.52s)]
*  I love you Caroline Levitt. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=81.36s)]
*  But they're forcing you to lie. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  Drain the swamp, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=87.16s)]
*  I support Trump, however, this isn't a good look. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=89.16s)]
*  Sorry, I just don't believe you anymore. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=92.08s)]
*  Stop the gaslighting. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=94.6s)]
*  We want the Epstein clients arrested now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't care if it brings down the entire US government, so be it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=98.28s)]
*  Y'all waking up in the comments now, huh? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=102.84s)]
*  We are all getting played. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=105.16s)]
*  What a joke. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't care if you're right, left, center, underneath, whatever. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  America people need to know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=111.24s)]
*  The obvious follow-up question needs to be why. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=112.88s)]
*  Why are you lying and who are you protecting? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  This person goes, I voted for Trump and like his team very much. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=117.96s)]
*  However, this is total BS and looks like another cover up at this time by the people who said [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  they would hold other people accountable. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=126.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what you thought they were going to hold? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  They're literally the swamp. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=131.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is literally a sexual abuser. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  He was found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=136.04s)]
*  He's on camera bragging about sexually assaulting women and saying because he's rich, you get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  away with it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=142.88s)]
*  He says that Epstein's a great guy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  He's all over Epstein's flight log and call log and Epstein was on Trump's plane and Epstein [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=146.56s)]
*  recruited girls from Mar-a-Lago like Virginia Joufray, underage girls who were working at [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=153.56s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=158.72s)]
*  I can say that because it's all true. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=159.72s)]
*  It's all true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  Trump would bring his kids around Epstein. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=163.04s)]
*  So you go to Donald Trump's post on Trump's social media and you see comments like this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=165.72s)]
*  directed at Donald Trump. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=171.4s)]
*  Bondi needs to go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=173.08s)]
*  So they're trying to like act like Bondi did this on her own. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=174.68s)]
*  She has to go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=177.8s)]
*  Then someone goes to Trump, sir, with all due respect, if those at the highest levels [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=179.4s)]
*  are not being arrested, we the people have little faith that any of this will matter. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=183.64s)]
*  Either fire Pam Bondi, Cash and Bongino or we will have major problems in this country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=188.52s)]
*  due to lack of accountability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  We know she had the client list on her desk. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=196.52s)]
*  Patriot for life, who usually just says whatever Donald Trump wants goes, oh boy, I think we're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=200.68s)]
*  all being played here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=205.56s)]
*  Patriots. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=207.4s)]
*  DC Draino goes, assuming this leaked Epstein files memo is true, then we all know this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=208.4s)]
*  is a shameful cover up to protect the most heinous of elites. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=213.36s)]
*  We were told multiple times the files would be released and now it looks like backroom [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=217.68s)]
*  deals have been made to keep them hidden. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  You're telling me the only publicly known client was a member of the UK royal family [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=225.56s)]
*  and this blackmail operation didn't cascade down to all levels of business and political [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=230.44s)]
*  power. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=235.96s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=236.96s)]
*  We all know Epstein has a long client list of powerful household names and now the entire [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=237.96s)]
*  country can see there are three or three tiers of justice in this country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=241.8s)]
*  Why is your DOJ and FBI protecting pedophiles? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  So lots of comments like that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=251.04s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump's top legal advisor, Tom Fitton, attacking Trump and Trump's DOJ. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=253.44s)]
*  Here's Fitton. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=260.4s)]
*  You can hear him for yourself. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=261.4s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=262.4s)]
*  So Fitton, please explain to our audience what in the hell happened. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=263.4s)]
*  What is this thing that came out last night, sir? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=267.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=269.52s)]
*  I read the memo three or four times again this morning and it's really, I don't think [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=270.52s)]
*  the Biden administration would have written anything like this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=280.76s)]
*  I just don't think they could have thought they could get away with it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=283.48s)]
*  And I've got to wonder what is going on at the leadership of the Justice Department and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=287.6s)]
*  the FBI to allow them to think that statements like as follows. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=292.44s)]
*  This is a classic. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=299.28s)]
*  Of course, we're suing for this stuff, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=300.28s)]
*  And so they say the systemic systematic review revealed a no incriminating client list. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=303.04s)]
*  So there's a client list, but it's not incriminating. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=316.48s)]
*  So therefore you can't see it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=319.18s)]
*  There is also no credible evidence that found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=322.16s)]
*  as part of his actions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=330.18s)]
*  Give us the incredible evidence. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  So they uncovered evidence, but it wasn't enough to predicate an investigation against [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=343.48s)]
*  uncharged third parties. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=348.68s)]
*  So you can go line by line and kind of, you know, go through this analysis that I'm going [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=350.62s)]
*  through and maybe unfair or overly critical. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  But in my view, unless you have the records to back up the conclusions you've drawn in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=359.92s)]
*  this in a case such as this, this isn't worth much. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=365.12s)]
*  And it's disturbing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=369.36s)]
*  It was leaked to Axios a second time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=370.36s)]
*  There's been a leak to Axios, by the way, by this Justice Department and FBI. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=372.36s)]
*  Remember, we sued for the Biden videotapes of his interview with her. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=376.36s)]
*  We were in court, literally in federal court. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=382.28s)]
*  They're stonewalling us. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=385.56s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=387.24s)]
*  They give it to Axios. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=388.24s)]
*  Here they give it to Axios. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=391.32s)]
*  And I mean, each memo, by the way, it kind of drips with contempt for people like you, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=392.8s)]
*  Vannan, for Judicial Watch, for anyone asking questions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=399.04s)]
*  Give us the documents. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=402.32s)]
*  Judicial Watch. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=403.32s)]
*  And here you can see some other MAGA influencers and other right-wing influencers, you know, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=404.32s)]
*  just super pissed that the files have not been released. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=410.56s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  This seems like unforgivable behavior. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  How could she give us those Phase One binders that contains nothing while bragging about [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=417.24s)]
*  the cover sheet that she made, the most transparent administration in history, and tell us that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=423.0s)]
*  the SDNY had the real goods, the binder was just proof of a deep state cover-up, that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=426.88s)]
*  was the real story she told us, only to now say, sorry, there's nothing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  If I'm President Trump, I wouldn't tolerate it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=436.32s)]
*  She's a liability to him. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  She's not worth it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=441.68s)]
*  Another ally of the president's, Laura Lumer, suggested that Bondi should, quote, resign [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=444.92s)]
*  for lying to the American people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWeToKyEw3w&t=449.3s)]
