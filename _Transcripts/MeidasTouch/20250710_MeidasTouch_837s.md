# Trump gets THROWN UNDER the BUS by his TOP SUPPORTERS
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8)
*  Donald Trump's top supporters and even his former lawyer are throwing him under the bus as he tries to cover up his dark and disgusting past. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=0.0s)]
*  I've laid out Donald Trump's connections with Jeffrey Epstein in detail in many of the past videos that I've done. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=7.2s)]
*  You can go out and check that out, how I go over in meticulous detail. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=13.56s)]
*  Donald Trump appearing on deposition transcripts in Epstein's civil cases. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is DOE 174 in a case involving Epstein. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=21.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is all over Epstein's flight log. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=25.2s)]
*  Epstein was on Donald Trump's plane recently in 2024. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=27.36s)]
*  Donald Trump was flying around in the Epstein jet that was wrapped with Trump 2024. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=30.4s)]
*  Donald Trump in 2002 said Epstein's a great guy who likes girls on the younger side. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=35.56s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago was used to recruit girls who were sex trafficked by Epstein. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=39.72s)]
*  For example, Virginia Jouffre working at Mar-a-Lago at 17. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, who Donald Trump wished well at her sex trafficking criminal trial, went to Mar-a-Lago, found Virginia Jouffre, brought her over to Epstein. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=48.0s)]
*  Epstein sex trafficker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=56.6s)]
*  I can go on and on and on, but you get the point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=58.0s)]
*  Now, on the flagrant podcast and these podcast hosts, these are like the podcast bros, right, who voted for Donald Trump and pushed Trump in 2024. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=59.92s)]
*  Here's what they had to say. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=70.92s)]
*  They go, so where are the idiots, right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=72.36s)]
*  After Donald Trump is covering up the release of the Epstein list and saying it never existed, likely because Donald Trump's all over the files that are not being released. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=74.28s)]
*  Here's what they say on the flagrant podcast. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=84.56s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=86.56s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  We have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=89.72s)]
*  And are people talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=92.88s)]
*  So we're stupid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=95.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're the fucking idiots, guys. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=96.44s)]
*  That is, I think what is enraging people right now is it's insulting our intelligence. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  Like, obviously, the intelligence community is trying to cover it up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=104.96s)]
*  Obviously, the Trump administration is trying to cover up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=107.72s)]
*  Something changed because they ran on this idea of exposing it all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  All these guys had great ideas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=114.44s)]
*  Cocky cash, Dan Boyd, Jeno. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=115.92s)]
*  He had clips, dog. He had bars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  He was ready to tear it all down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=119.08s)]
*  He was ready to tear down the entire FBI office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Shut down the Hoover building day one. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Day one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=124.52s)]
*  Then, bitch, still staying. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=124.96s)]
*  And then he goes on Joe Rogan and he's like, listen, do you think if I had it, I wouldn't share it with you? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=125.92s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=131.12s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=131.72s)]
*  I do believe that 100%, especially when you're staring at me like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=132.96s)]
*  Tell him that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=136.64s)]
*  Once you protect pedophiles, you are the most cocky person. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=137.68s)]
*  So one of two things in my mind is impossible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  One, you're covering it up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=143.48s)]
*  Or two, nothing really happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  And you exploited the thousands of children to get your man elected. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  So which one do you want here? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, let's take a look at what a lot of MAGA supporters and others are saying on TikTok. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=152.88s)]
*  Let's play this one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=159.44s)]
*  I voted for Donald Trump in 2016, 2020, and 2024. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=160.28s)]
*  I am prepared to die on this hill. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=168.48s)]
*  If Donald Trump is part of the Epstein list and why he has decided to pretend like doesn't exist anymore, then the war that I've been [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  waging on liberals and everyone that has been completely insane, I plan to wage on Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  If he cannot explain or make sense of this, it's pointing to that he is implicated to the fullest degree. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  If he is going to pretend like this doesn't exist, Jeffrey Epstein isn't a big deal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=208.88s)]
*  What he said today, I was like, bro, get fucked. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  Or how about this one right here? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm a Trump supporter. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=225.44s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you this right now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=227.44s)]
*  If this is the verdict, there's no Epstein client list. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  Then all of us that have installed Bongino and Cash Patel, the whole Trump administration period, all they talked about was transparency. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  If we don't get accountability for the thousands of victims that were abused, who knows what type of crimes are talking? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=245.04s)]
*  Then I'm jumping ship. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=255.88s)]
*  And all of you should as well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=257.48s)]
*  We the people control this narrative. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=259.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=261.36s)]
*  So all I'm saying is that from Russian collusion to the impeachment, to tax fraud cases, you name it, they threw everything but the kitchen sink at Trump. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=262.36s)]
*  I've always said that even dating back to COVID, that this was all about protecting those from death sentences. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=275.16s)]
*  We need to make a stand. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=280.92s)]
*  Now, Jeffrey Epstein's brother went on Piers Morgan, and this is what he had to say, play this clip. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  What do you think they might be covering up for? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  So you think they're covering up for President Trump? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=292.36s)]
*  People look at all of us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=294.24s)]
*  Everybody is looking at little pieces of this and coming up with kind of theories, but people really take the time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  Because there's a lot of facts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=301.32000000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of information. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  People take the time and really investigate this thoroughly. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=304.72s)]
*  All come to the pretty much conclusion that maybe Trump was behind this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=314.8s)]
*  Maybe maybe Jeff was killed to quiet them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=315.36s)]
*  You think you think President Trump has something to do with with Epstein, with your brother being killed? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=319.48s)]
*  I wouldn't write that off. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=325.48s)]
*  Because if you look at all of the evidence we have and all of the facts, not opinions, and all of the facts, it wouldn't be something I would dismiss. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  Bill O'Reilly, a very close friend of Donald Trump's, said that Trump told him that Epstein files can't be released because they would expose rich and powerful men. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=340.52s)]
*  Again, O'Reilly, very close with Donald Trump. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=351.08s)]
*  Here's what he had to say, play this clip. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=354.68s)]
*  Talk to President Trump, man to man, eye to eye on St. Patrick's Day about this and the Kennedy files and the King files. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=356.4s)]
*  It was all one conversation. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=363.64s)]
*  And he said, and I agree, there are a lot of names associated with Epstein. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=366.12s)]
*  It had nothing to do with Epstein's conduct. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=370.96s)]
*  They maybe had lunch with him or maybe had some correspondence for one thing or another. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=372.84s)]
*  If that name gets out, those people are destroyed because it's not going to be any context. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=378.08s)]
*  Media doesn't care about context. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=383.12s)]
*  So you can't do that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, you know the right wing podcast, Candace Owens. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=388.52s)]
*  Here's what she had to say about all of this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  It requires us to be so gaslit that we completely forget that nobody made more of a show of the Jeffrey Epstein files and the release of those files. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=394.0s)]
*  Then the person sitting to the right of him, Pam Bondi. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=406.32s)]
*  That's why we're here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=408.76s)]
*  Pam Bondi was the one who notoriously handed out binders to a bunch of online influencers on February 27th. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=410.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  That was supposed to be apparently phase one. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  And then too many of those influencers decided to pose in like cute pics with the binders. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=428.48s)]
*  Like this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=429.16s)]
*  Look at this influencer. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  Cute pic. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=430.8s)]
*  Just me with the binder. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  See that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=433.68s)]
*  It says in red print in case you can't see it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  The Epstein files. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=436.56s)]
*  Phase one. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  Now here's another clip from the flagrant podcast where they all say they definitely regret voting for Donald Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Now here play this clip. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  Damn me, Beck. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  You see what you see what your boy doing? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=450.56s)]
*  You voted for this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=452.12s)]
*  I'm like, I voted for none of this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=452.92s)]
*  He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=455.76s)]
*  I want him to stop the wars. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=458.92s)]
*  He's funding them. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=460.16s)]
*  I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=461.04s)]
*  He's increasing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=463.88s)]
*  It's like everything that he said he's going to do except sending immigrants back. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=464.8s)]
*  Everything. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=470.32s)]
*  And now he's even flip flopped on that, which I kind of like. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=470.64s)]
*  But he's like, oh, well, we kind of need the people working in restaurants and we need our farmers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like everything that he said that he was going to do that he can campaign. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=476.68s)]
*  He said to us, which was important, and I thought it was good, he pressed him on it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, you got to start with the criminals in terms of deporting. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=483.6s)]
*  I don't think he's I don't even know if the criminals are getting sent back. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  I know there's a lot of people with gris, people with green cards getting sent back. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=489.8s)]
*  There's people who aren't criminals getting sent back. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you're sending back the criminals first. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=496.16s)]
*  You definitely don't know first. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=498.12s)]
*  I don't be sending them back at all. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=499.12s)]
*  So nothing has happened. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=500.6s)]
*  And you were more optimistic than I was because I judge him by his first four. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  And it was Mr. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  Drame the swamp, Mr. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=507.76s)]
*  Build the wall, Mr. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=508.96s)]
*  Like he didn't do a lot of the stuff he promised in the first floor. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=510.48s)]
*  So why would anything? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=513.2s)]
*  I didn't I already I already expect politicians to not do most of the shit they say. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=514.2s)]
*  You know me, I'm not into chasing trends, but I am all about clothes that fit right, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=519.52s)]
*  feel amazing and actually last. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=523.08s)]
*  That's why I keep coming back to quints. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=524.92s)]
*  Their lightweight layers and high quality staples have totally revamped my closet [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=526.68s)]
*  and become my everyday wear. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  I picked up their flow knit polos and cotton button down shirts, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=531.92s)]
*  and I've been wearing them nonstop. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=534.64s)]
*  The polos are breathable and perfect for summer days, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=536.36s)]
*  while the shirts are crisp enough for meetings and still relaxed for weekend dinners. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=538.76s)]
*  True story, I wore their organic cotton silk polo sweater out to dinner last night. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=543.04s)]
*  I even grabbed a pair of their lightweight pants, which somehow work just as well with sneakers [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=548.2s)]
*  as they do with dress shoes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=554.0s)]
*  You get all that at half the cost of similar brands. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=554.96s)]
*  Quince works directly with top artisans, cuts out the middlemen and only partners [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=558.28s)]
*  with factories that use safe, ethical and responsible manufacturing practices. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=562.64s)]

*  As I mentioned at the outset of this video, Donald Trump's former lawyer, Dershowitz, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=596.32s)]
*  here's what he has to say. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=602.52s)]
*  He says, I know for a fact, I know for a fact these docs and the list is being suppressed. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=604.24s)]
*  This is Dershowitz. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=609.44s)]
*  Dershowitz is Trump's own former lawyer. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=610.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  So let me tell you, I know for a fact documents are being suppressed and they're being suppressed [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=614.64s)]
*  to protect individuals. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  I know the names of the individuals. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=620.76s)]
*  I know why they're being suppressed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=622.8s)]
*  I know who's suppressing them, but I'm bound by confidentiality from a judge and cases. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=624.72s)]
*  And I can't disclose what I know, but I hand to God. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=631.56s)]
*  I know, I know the names of people whose files are being suppressed in order to protect them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=635.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's wrong. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=642.12s)]
*  And just to remind you a little bit about Dershowitz, here was some of his connections [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=643.44s)]
*  with Epstein. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=646.96s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=647.96s)]
*  You represented him in the criminal underage sex case. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=648.96s)]
*  Could you please? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=650.88s)]
*  I never saw a young underage woman. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=651.88s)]
*  Yet Epstein's former butler swore under oath that Dershowitz was at Epstein's residences. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=654.6s)]
*  At the same time, underage girls were there. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=659.5200000000001s)]
*  Were there young women in another part of the house giving massages when I wasn't around? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=662.16s)]
*  I have no idea of that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  Dershowitz did say he once received a massage at Epstein's mansion, but from an adult woman. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  I kept my underwear on during the massage. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=674.76s)]
*  I don't like massages particularly. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=678.48s)]
*  One of the other stories that broke this morning as well is that Donald Trump weighed pardoning [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=680.8399999999999s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, he wished her well for the fear that she would spill secrets about his decade long [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  friendship with Epstein, according to Trump biographer, Michael Wolff. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=691.8s)]
*  And then over here, we have Natalie Winters, who's on Steve Bannon's War Room. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=697.0s)]
*  Again, big Trump supporter, big MAGA person. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=702.56s)]
*  She writes, MAGA rose because Americans were unsatisfied with establishment Republicans, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=705.66s)]
*  lying that accountability is found in press releases and meaningful politicking. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=711.16s)]
*  We want prison sentences. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  The Epstein list debacle is an affront to the foundation of the MAGA movement. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=718.16s)]
*  Here's what she has to say. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=723.56s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=724.64s)]
*  As someone who has been on shows co-hosted with a lot of the people, the clips that we've [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=725.64s)]
*  played of people who have called out Jeffrey Epstein for years and made millions of dollars [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=729.76s)]
*  off of it, it is absolutely reprehensible and it is a complete grift. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=734.0s)]
*  And you have now, and their words probably become the deep state. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're going to run cover for this and you think that the MAGA audience is dumb enough [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=741.68s)]
*  to not, I don't know, be able to go back two months and see the comments you were making [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=746.36s)]
*  on Fox News. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=749.96s)]
*  We need to get this right. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=751.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if I have faith in Pan Bondi anymore, but this is a really, really concerning [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  moment for MAGA. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=756.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=757.88s)]
*  I mean, destiny. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=758.88s)]
*  And just to remind you of what Donald Trump said about Delaine Maxwell during her sex [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=759.88s)]
*  trafficking case, this is when he wished her well. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  And this is when he was considered pardoning her, by the way. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=767.6400000000001s)]
*  And he just wished her well when he was nervous that she would potentially speak up here. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=769.96s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=774.48s)]
*  Just Elaine Maxwell is in prison and a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=775.96s)]
*  in powerful people. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=781.24s)]
*  I know you've talked in the past about Prince Andrew and you've criticized Bill Clinton's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=782.24s)]
*  behavior. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=787.08s)]
*  I'm wondering, do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=788.08s)]
*  How do you see that working out? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=791.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=792.8000000000001s)]

*  I just wish her well, frankly. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=795.16s)]
*  I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=797.36s)]
*  I guess they lived in Palm Beach. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  But I wish her well. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=803.84s)]
*  Whatever it is, I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4q7IqdUhr8&t=805.36s)]
