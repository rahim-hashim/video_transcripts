# FURIOUS West Point Grad DESTROYS Trump after Speech
**MeidasTouch:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw)
*  With all of the noise out there, sometimes we just lose the signal that this is not normal and it's not okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=0.0s)]
*  When we watch Donald Trump with his red political hat in front of the army grads giving this disastrous speech at West Point, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=6.4s)]
*  yes, it's ridiculous, yes, it's deranged, yes, it's dangerous, but it frequently becomes a one-day story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Then we move on to the next one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Not we here at the Midas Touch Network, but the collective kind of we, and I'm referring more though to the kind of corporate news [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=24.5s)]
*  and why we've been created to try to stop that because we can't move on from these things and just go on to the next crisis [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=31.5s)]
*  or the next scandal or the next him making a fool of himself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=38.7s)]
*  These things make lasting impressions. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=42.3s)]
*  And so I thought it was very important that we actually speak to a West Point grad and a West Point grad who finished top 2% of the entire class [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=44.7s)]
*  when she graduated and get really an inside perspective of what went down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=54.1s)]
*  And I think it's also important that when we think about what Donald Trump's speech was, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=59.0s)]
*  we again reflect on other West Point commencement speeches and what could have been in the words of former Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=64.5s)]
*  because I remember her speech in 2023, which focused on the graduating class. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=76.0s)]
*  It focused on the future leaders in the Army and what that meant, not on trophy wives, not on not liking stealth technology, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=82.1s)]
*  not on attacking former administrations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=92.2s)]
*  It focused on the graduating class. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=95.8s)]
*  So here's what former Vice President Kamala Harris had to say here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=97.5s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=100.7s)]
*  And to all the cadets here today, you stand on the broad shoulders of generations of Americans who have worn the uniform, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=101.8s)]
*  including many barrier breakers and trailblazers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=114.0s)]
*  In fact, this year you celebrate the 75th anniversary of the integration of women in the military, as well as the desegregation of our military. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=118.0s)]
*  These milestones are a reminder of a fundamental truth. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=131.7s)]
*  Our military is strongest when it fully reflects the people of America. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=139.89999999999998s)]
*  West Point, each and every day, America's service members demonstrate extraordinary skill, dedication, and discipline. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=147.2s)]
*  They are willing to sacrifice everything to protect the lives and liberty of people they may never meet. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=161.2s)]
*  And I believe there is no more noble work that a person can do than to serve our nation in uniform. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=171.7s)]
*  And today, then to the class of 2023, you join the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=182.5s)]
*  So now contrast that to Donald Trump's speech from this past weekend. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=201.8s)]
*  Company and he had nothing to do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=206.8s)]
*  He ended up getting a divorce, found a new wife. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  Could you say a trophy wife? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=215.4s)]
*  I guess we can say a trophy one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  It didn't work out too well, but it doesn't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  And that doesn't work out too well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  I must tell you a lot of trophy wives doesn't work out, but it made him happy for a little while at least. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  But he found a new wife. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  He sold his little boat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  You got a big yacht. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=233.8s)]
*  He had one of the biggest yachts anywhere in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=234.8s)]
*  So I want to introduce you now to a West Point grad. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  Name is Kate Conley. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=242.0s)]
*  She's running for the congressional seat in New York's 17th congressional district against [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  MAGA Republican Mike Lawler. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=249.8s)]
*  In addition to graduating from West Point, Kate Conley got her degree, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=252.4s)]
*  Master's degree from MIT and from Harvard. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  16 years on active duty as an Army officer, deploying overseas six times to keep American safe in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=262.5s)]
*  Kate Conley, welcome to the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=274.0s)]
*  And first and foremost, thank you for your service. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=277.1s)]
*  And I want to just get your response to from an insider's perspective on what went down and how it impacted you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=281.0s)]
*  Ben, thanks so much. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=290.9s)]
*  And to how you introduced this episode. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=291.9s)]
*  I could not agree more on the importance about talking about things like West Point and the importance of service and how that type of leadership [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=294.9s)]
*  and that type of sacrifice transcends all. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=303.5s)]
*  It's not political. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  It's patriotic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=306.5s)]
*  And unfortunately, what we saw transpire at the commencement address didn't resonate with those types of ethics or ethos. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=307.9s)]
*  And so I do think it's really important that we talk about these types of issues, the signal through the noise and why it matters. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=315.2s)]
*  And so I'll tell you somebody who born and raised in the Hudson Valley. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  I was a junior in high school when 9-11 happened and I went home that night and I told my mom I'm applying to West Point. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=325.4s)]
*  And that's because we didn't have much grown up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=332.4s)]
*  My mom works for the Postal Service for 47 years. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=334.9s)]
*  My dad was a construction worker. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=338.5s)]
*  So total blue collar family didn't have many means. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=340.5s)]
*  But I will tell you we had a tremendous amount of pride in this nation and a strong sense of service to your neighbors, to your community, to country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=344.0s)]
*  And so that's why going to West Point was undoubtedly the right answer for me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=353.5s)]
*  I also give credit to Demi Moore and G.I. Jane, which I watched a ton of as a kid. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=358.4s)]
*  I'm helping know that's the direction we wanted to go, at least military service. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=363.1s)]
*  But that that responsibility, that privilege to serve. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=367.4s)]
*  I mean, this is really one of the most beautiful things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=372.0s)]
*  I think that represents who we are as a nation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=374.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, the four years at West Point and that experience was truly incredible and shaping as a young officer to then lead men and women in uniform on combat tours overseas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=376.5s)]
*  You talked about 16 years in active duty service. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  I will tell you, I went back to West Point often during those years when I visit my family to remind myself about the incredible ideals that that institution was established on and cultivates in the next generation of military leaders. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's this beautiful place where, you know, you have young men and women from all 50 states and territories, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=407.8s)]
*  from families that span the economic spectrum of some of our country's poorest to some of our country's wealthiest families. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=414.0s)]
*  And they're all there with this one incredible calling. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=421.6s)]
*  And that is to serve our country, to swear an oath to the Constitution, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=425.1s)]
*  To to put your life on the line in in support of something bigger and better than yourself. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=428.9s)]
*  And that is the security and safety of Americans. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=435.4s)]
*  And really, I think living that type of lifestyle and understanding that responsibility is something that leaders in Washington need to not only recognize and honor and respect, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=438.7s)]
*  but to also continue to cultivate and instill. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  And so when you look at our nation and the challenges we still have ahead of us, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=456.2s)]
*  we need leaders that are laser focused on the very real national security challenges our country faces. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=460.7s)]
*  We have things like a war in Ukraine that are still raging. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=466.3s)]
*  We have terrorist groups that are still plotting against the United States and Americans. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=469.2s)]
*  We have Iran looking to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=473.0s)]
*  Like there are very real national security challenges that our nation should be focused on. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=475.7s)]
*  And instead, you know, we're talking about these nonsense things. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=481.6s)]
*  And so this is where I think serious leaders who've actually gone out there and seen what it takes to get it done are important to step up right now and to say, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  let's focus on what really matters for the American people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=495.0s)]
*  You know, and I think that's the most important thing is to talk about just leadership. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=499.0s)]
*  And then I guess even even a step below on the hierarchy, how about just like behaving like an adult, like like a grownup? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=505.6s)]
*  And and the behavior that I see frequently from Donald Trump and the leaders in this Republican Party feels. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=513.3s)]
*  And again, it's offensive to children because children behave more mature than this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=523.4s)]
*  But sometimes I say this behavior is like if a little child was doing these things or posting these types of things or, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=527.9s)]
*  you know, behaving this way, I would say I'm not OK with it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  So why are we supporting it when it's in a Republican, when it's a political party? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  And why is it being normalized as like whatever? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=547.9s)]
*  And, you know, I go to your district because someone like a Mike Lawler was out there trying at first. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=551.5s)]
*  He represented to everybody in the community that he was the normal guy that he was going to go in there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=558.0s)]
*  And I'm a centrist. And occasionally, you know, you'll see him try to pretend to do that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=563.9s)]
*  He'll do, you know, the funny bit. Hey, you remember me? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=569.0s)]
*  I'm Lawler. Everybody remembers me. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=571.6s)]
*  But then when it comes to the voting, when it comes to the actual time, OK, well, now you got to be a leader. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=573.8s)]
*  Every single time he'll do the exact opposite. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=580.8s)]
*  And that and that that complicity to me is what enable it's almost worse than that than the trumps because we know what the trumps are. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=584.0s)]
*  To me, it's the wolf in sheep's clothing like the Lawlers that get me even more worried. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, then you're talking about I did the six overseas tours that I can kind of talk about that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  A lot of my stuff that I did during those days was classified. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=605.9s)]
*  But, you know, going to Yemen to target Al Qaeda, the Arab Peninsula terrorists. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=608.5s)]
*  If you remember the underwear bomber from 2009 that came from Al Qaeda, the Arab Peninsula. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=613.9s)]
*  If you remember after Benghazi, I went to North Africa, right, to hold those accountable for the attacks on Benghazi Consulate accountable. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  We did things like fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=627.4s)]
*  As they were plotting terror attacks and trying to really mobilize lone wolf terrorist actors in Europe and the United States, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=632.6s)]
*  when you look at the importance of these missions that are truly no fail, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=640.6s)]
*  you don't have the luxury of just saying whatever you want or doing whatever you want. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=646.6s)]
*  You have a responsibility to deal with the hard facts and realities. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=650.9s)]
*  You don't have the luxury of not doing your job or saying one thing and doing another. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=654.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is what we're talking about right now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=658.7s)]
*  The stakes are too high. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=662.3s)]
*  Failure is not an option. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=664.0s)]
*  And we don't have serious people taking this stuff on. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  We have people who say one thing and do another. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  Whether it's incidents like Signalgate, whether it's things like the commencement speech we just heard, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=671.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, or just overall conduct and decision making, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=677.9s)]
*  the stakes are too high for failure and instead of having these really thoughtful and deliberate discussions and processes and taking it seriously, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=681.0999999999999s)]
*  we see these routine mistakes that are largely based in either negligence or just disregard for doing the right thing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=689.7s)]
*  And this is where it's like we should be showing the world right now that America is a superpower. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=695.4s)]
*  And instead we're showing them its amateur hour. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=701.1s)]
*  And the American people deserve better. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=703.7s)]
*  You know, we just celebrated Memorial Day where we honor those who've given the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=706.2s)]
*  not a single political party, but for all Americans and for our country and what we stand for. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=713.1s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to constantly remember is we owe those people, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=718.6s)]
*  those patriots who put this nation first and gave all to honor that sacrifice by making this country better than we found it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=722.5s)]
*  Right. And I am a firm believer and I have tremendous faith that the best days for our country are still ahead of us. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=731.5s)]
*  But we have a tremendous amount of work to do to make sure that is the case. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=739.7s)]
*  And I don't see politicians stepping up and demonstrating they can lead us out of this. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=744.2s)]
*  No, finally, when it comes to New York's 17th congressional district, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=749.4000000000001s)]
*  that's the district Hudson Valley that Mike Lawler, Republican holds right now. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=754.0s)]
*  It's a competitive Democratic primary field. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=759.1s)]
*  We had the opportunity to speak to others, you know, in the primary. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=761.9000000000001s)]
*  So we were glad to be able to to kind of speak to you as well. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=765.2s)]
*  So to tell our audience about, you know, your vision in that congressional district [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=768.7s)]
*  and in a competitive primary field, what's been your pitch to the voters? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=773.9s)]
*  Thanks, Ben. So I'll tell you running for office was not my plan for 2025. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=778.3s)]
*  But I feel like I have a responsibility right now to step up [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=783.4s)]
*  because I believe our country is at a crossroads and the politicians who got us into this mess on both sides [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=788.8s)]
*  are not going to be the ones who fix it or lead us out of it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  And right now, our country needs true leadership. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  That's where I am incredibly proud of my Hudson Valley roots. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=802.1s)]
*  I told you my mom, right, post office or 47 years, my dad, a construction worker. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=804.9s)]
*  I understand how hard it is for working families to make ends meet. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=810.3s)]
*  I hear about families who are working two jobs and still can't pay the rent or are cutting back on grocery bills, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=814.7s)]
*  but they can still barely afford their prescriptions. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=820.0s)]
*  Like we have made it too hard in America for working class families to get by. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=822.1s)]
*  We have to focus on making this more affordable and taking care of the people who are throwing everything they in. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=826.2s)]
*  They have in to make this country the incredible place that it is. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=831.9s)]
*  And so that's where I think there is a tremendous amount of work to be done. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=835.5s)]
*  And I don't think we see that happening. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=838.3s)]
*  I mean, look at the House bill that just passed, right, where we're cutting 700 billion in Medicaid. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=839.8s)]
*  We're going to leave working class families like in limbo for their own health care. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=844.4s)]
*  And that should be unacceptable here. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  And this is where it goes back to we need true leaders to step up. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=853.8s)]
*  We're going to do what's right for this country for all Americans. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  And this is where certainly in New York 17, we deserve better. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=861.0s)]
*  And that's where I have been incredibly disappointed by the lack of leadership, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=864.4s)]
*  by the two-facedness that we're seeing coming out of Mike Lawler. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=868.1s)]
*  And my family deserves better. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=871.0s)]
*  I deserve better. This community deserves better. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=872.6s)]
*  So that's why I'm doing this because throughout my career, I raised my hand to say I will continue to serve this country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=874.8s)]
*  I have been a proven leader. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=882.4s)]
*  That's battle tested. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=883.9s)]
*  That's delivered results for this country. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=885.1s)]
*  And I will continue to do that for New York 17. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=887.2s)]
*  And I think that type of leadership matters more now than ever. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=889.8s)]
*  Kate Connolly, thanks for your service and thank you for your perspective on the West Point grant. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=894.3s)]
*  And thanks for everything you're doing for joining us. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=899.0s)]
*  No, thanks so much, Ben. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_tvKJPTDw&t=902.1999999999999s)]
