Video Description: On today’s MeidasTouch Podcast: A federal appeals court has paused a landmark ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade that had blocked Trump’s unconstitutional tariffs—what’s next in this major legal battle? We break down the latest in Trump’s war on Harvard as he targets higher education with political vengeance. Meanwhile, Trump continues to get played by Putin on the world stage, looking weaker than ever. Back at home, Republicans are getting booed out of their own town halls over their support for Trump and the extreme GOP budget plan. Plus, Karoline Leavitt’s press conference goes completely off the rails, weekly jobless claims rise, and we cover even more headlines the corporate media won’t. Ben, Brett and Jordy break it all down!

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 5/29/25
**MeidasTouch:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE)
*  Welcome to the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=0.0s)]
*  As someone who was a former litigator, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4.0s)]
*  I wanna take some of these clips that I'm about to show you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=7.34s)]
*  I wanna bring you the receipts to show you the anatomy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=11.14s)]
*  of the fraud, the grift, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=14.58s)]
*  and what's really going on here with the Trump regime. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=17.06s)]
*  Let me bring in Bret and Jordy right now as well, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=19.82s)]
*  because I wanna watch you as we look through [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=22.68s)]
*  some of these clips together [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=25.0s)]
*  with the Midas Mighty viewers and listeners. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  So the first clip I wanna show you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=29.92s)]
*  is Donald Trump being asked about, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  the fact that the war in Ukraine is still raging. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Vladimir Putin continues to escalate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  while you have Zelensky talk about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=41.24s)]
*  that he's agreeable to an unconditional ceasefire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=44.32s)]
*  So when Donald Trump's asked about his dealings with Putin, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=47.84s)]
*  Donald Trump does his normal, give me two weeks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=51.52s)]
*  I just need, let's see what happens in two weeks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=54.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=57.52s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=58.76s)]
*  Mr. President, on Russia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=60.08s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  On Russia, Mr. President. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=62.0s)]
*  Please. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=62.84s)]
*  Do you believe the Russians are being disrespectful [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=64.72s)]
*  when they say that your criticisms of Putin [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=67.16s)]
*  are simply an emotional response? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=69.92s)]
*  And do you still believe that Putin [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=72.14s)]
*  actually wants to end the war? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't tell you that, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=75.84s)]
*  but I'll let you know in about two weeks, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=77.0s)]
*  within two weeks, we're gonna find out very soon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=78.84s)]
*  We're gonna find out whether or not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=82.6s)]
*  he's tapping us along or not. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=84.56s)]
*  And if he is, we'll respond a little bit differently, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=86.48s)]
*  but it'll take about a week and a half, two weeks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=89.4s)]
*  We have, Mr. Witkoff is here, he's doing a phenomenal job. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=91.36s)]
*  Mr. Witkoff is a real estate guy from New York [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  who's not doing a really good job. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=100.28s)]
*  He's the guy who showed up, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=102.22s)]
*  was at his fourth meeting with Putin, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=103.94s)]
*  and he used the Russian intelligence officer [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=106.04s)]
*  as his interpreter and did not bring anybody [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  from the United States Embassy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=112.42s)]
*  to actually be there with him at his meetings with Putin. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=114.6s)]
*  And Trump promised he would end the war in Ukraine [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  in 24 hours within taking the office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=120.44s)]
*  And he said, in fact, it was so easy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=123.44s)]
*  that he would be able to actually resolve it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=125.3s)]
*  before he took office, but with everything, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=127.88s)]
*  whether it's a healthcare plan, whether it's this or that, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=130.4s)]
*  he always says, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  we'll release it, we'll do that, and then he never does it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=136.14s)]
*  The next clip I wanna show you again, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=138.94s)]
*  exhibit B, is Donald Trump claiming [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=141.08s)]
*  that he brought back to the United States [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  as though we have it right now, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=147.28s)]
*  $5.1 trillion from his trip to the Middle East, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=149.72000000000003s)]
*  where, mind you, the GDP of Qatar is 200 billion, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=154.28s)]
*  UAE, 400 billion, I think Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  somewhere like one trillion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=164.24s)]
*  The entire GDP of all of those nations combined [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=166.44s)]
*  is like 1.5 trillion. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=170.48s)]
*  So are you telling me you took 3X or more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  of their annual GDP back to the United States, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=177.28s)]
*  which would represent somewhere in the range of 20% [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  of the entire United States GDP? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=184.0s)]
*  It's just more ridiculous lies, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=186.64s)]
*  but watch for yourself, let's play. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=188.64s)]
*  This isn't my war, this is Biden's war, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Zelensky's war, and Putin's war, this isn't Trump's war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm only here for one thing, to see if I can end it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  to save 5,000 lives a week and a lot of money, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=198.04s)]
*  the money being much less important, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=202.52s)]
*  because I made that money, I went to Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=204.12s)]
*  Qatar, and UAE, and we brought back $5.1 trillion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=207.28s)]
*  So I made that money in about two hours, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=213.84s)]
*  the money we were talking about, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=215.88s)]
*  but it's still three, think of it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=217.0s)]
*  $300 billion we've spent with no checks, no balances, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=218.68s)]
*  they just send cash. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=223.52s)]
*  So why $5.1 trillion? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=225.84s)]
*  Why does he make up that number? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=228.32s)]
*  One, con artists like to add like an extra number [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=230.32s)]
*  to make it sound a little bit specific, or like 5.1, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=234.16s)]
*  but also the deficit under Trump's disastrous budget bill, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=238.08s)]
*  they have to raise the debt ceiling by about $4 trillion. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=244.24s)]
*  So he just picks a number, $1 trillion above that, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=249.04s)]
*  to say, look, we're bringing the money back, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=252.92s)]
*  so it doesn't matter that we're going to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=256.48s)]
*  just blow up our deficit, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=258.64s)]
*  because I brought back 5.1 trillion, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=260.4s)]
*  so therefore we've actually made 1.1 trillion, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=263.76s)]
*  which is just total and utter crap. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=267.48s)]
*  The next clip, Brett and Jordy, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=269.64s)]
*  that I wanna show the Midas Mighty, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=271.0s)]
*  and I wanna show you, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=272.68s)]
*  and I wanna react to all of this together, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=273.56s)]
*  was actually a good question by Fox host, Peter Ducey, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=276.64s)]
*  who asked Caroline Levitt, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=280.28s)]
*  the chief propagandist of the Trump regime, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=281.96s)]
*  why don't you just have Congress, the House, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  and the Senate go and pass legislation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  that basically incorporates Trump's tariffs? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=293.64s)]
*  Then it would be legal, because the tariff authority [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  in Article One of the Constitution's with Congress, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=300.0s)]
*  and then there wouldn't be any legal issues. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  You control all branches, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  you control the House and the Senate, so do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=310.0s)]
*  So the courts are basically telling you guys, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=310.84s)]
*  they think that the White House's policies, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=312.28s)]
*  the President's policies are in some way against the law. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  So why can't President Trump ask the Republicans [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=318.08s)]
*  that control the House, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  and the Republicans that control the Senate, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  just to make a new law? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=324.4s)]
*  Well, these laws have already been granted to the President [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=327.28s)]
*  by the Constitution, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=329.88s)]
*  and by laws that have been previously passed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=331.0s)]
*  I'll give you another example. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  For instance, we've been blocked in court [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  for the revocation of visas from individuals [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  who have the privilege of studying [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=340.24s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=341.76s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio has simply used his authority [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=343.36s)]
*  to revoke those visas, to revoke that privilege, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  and we've seen the courts try to block that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=350.04s)]
*  So if these judges want to be the Secretary of State, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=351.88s)]
*  or they want to be the President, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=354.32s)]
*  they can run for office themselves. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=355.36s)]
*  It should be the other way around. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=356.64s)]
*  But all of the actions the President has taken [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=357.68s)]
*  rely on legal authorities that have already been granted [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  to him by our nation's existing laws. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=363.48s)]
*  And on a different... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=365.24s)]
*  Which is 100% false, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  unless, and by the way, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=369.88s)]
*  notice how she pivots away from the tariff question, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  because what they're claiming [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  is that these extraordinary emergency powers, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=376.92s)]
*  which are to really be used in the most punitive ways [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=382.32s)]
*  in times of like war, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=386.64s)]
*  or massive economic distress and turmoil, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=389.2s)]
*  that Trump claims these emergency powers against the world. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=393.12s)]
*  That's why he makes up that Canada is at war [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=397.52s)]
*  with the United States by sending fentanyl in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=401.4s)]
*  to kill Americans. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=404.6s)]
*  That's why Trump says that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=405.68s)]
*  That's just what Putin does [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=407.56s)]
*  when he says denazification of Ukraine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=409.04s)]
*  Trump's version of denazification is that Canada [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=412.0s)]
*  is intentionally killing Americans from fentanyl, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=415.36s)]
*  and thus we need to attack, under emergency powers, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=418.56s)]
*  Canada with tariffs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=422.64s)]
*  And then he applies that concept [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=424.64s)]
*  to every single country in the world, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=427.32s)]
*  and says they are attacking us, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=430.24s)]
*  so we have to retaliate with emergency powers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=432.8s)]
*  The next question for Caroline Levitt [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  is about their Make America Healthy Again report, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  MAHA is what they call it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=443.68s)]
*  And it turns out when you look at this report, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  which they're using, the MAGAs, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=448.56s)]
*  to justify really ripping away essential care [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=450.68s)]
*  for tens of millions of Americans [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=454.92s)]
*  and stop studies on things, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=457.36s)]
*  it looks like it was written by AI. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=459.6s)]
*  And why do I say that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=462.12s)]
*  The citations use real epidemiologists' name, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=463.6s)]
*  but make up reports that the epidemiologists [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=468.92s)]
*  never even wrote before. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=472.12s)]
*  And so they're made up reports with made up citations [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=474.48s)]
*  and made up data, 71 pages, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=478.76s)]
*  that's just, the epidemiologists said, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=482.32s)]
*  I never wrote a report, I never wrote for JAMA, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=484.68s)]
*  which is one of these medical journals, I never wrote that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=487.68s)]
*  They're literally making things up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=490.4s)]
*  And HATTIP2 NOTICE, they're the media that broke that story. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  But here, play this clip. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=496.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Caroline. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=497.56s)]
*  A NOTICE investigation found that the Hallmark MAHA [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=499.24s)]
*  commission report that was released last week [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=501.92s)]
*  cites studies that appear to not exist. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  We know that because in part, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=506.4s)]
*  we reached out to some of the listed authors [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  who said that they didn't write the studies cited. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=510.12s)]
*  So I wanna ask, does the White House have confidence [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=512.84s)]
*  that the information coming from HHS can be trusted? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=515.44s)]
*  Yes, we have complete confidence in Secretary Kennedy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=518.8s)]
*  and his team at HHS. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=521.76s)]
*  I understand there were some formatting issues [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=523.2s)]
*  with the MAHA report that are being addressed [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=525.6s)]
*  and the report will be updated, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=527.64s)]
*  but it does not negate the substance of the report, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=529.2s)]
*  which as you know, is one of the most transformative [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=533.08s)]
*  health reports that has ever been released [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=535.6s)]
*  by the federal government and is backed on good science [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=537.64s)]
*  that has never been recognized by the federal government. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=540.96s)]
*  Can you talk about what tools or research goes [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=543.12s)]
*  into production of these kinds of reports? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=547.0s)]
*  For instance, is it AI that's used [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=548.72s)]
*  to put together these reports now? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=550.8s)]
*  I can't speak to that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=553.52s)]
*  I would defer you to the Department of Health [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=554.64s)]
*  and Human Services. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=556.64s)]
*  What I know is just what I told you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=557.48s)]
*  Let me bring in Brett and Jordi. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=561.12s)]
*  And I wanted to go over those clips particularly [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=563.08s)]
*  because they all highlight to me kind of a different area [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  where this fraud and danger, these threats, this harm [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=571.5999999999999s)]
*  is being inflicted and caused. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  And I wanna show you the strategies that are being used [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=578.68s)]
*  that are frankly worse than the worst stuff I read in 1984 [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=582.8s)]
*  when I read that in middle school, Brett. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when the Trump administration is speaking [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=588.76s)]
*  about waste, fraud and abuse, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=591.36s)]
*  I think it's all the time and the call is coming [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=593.0s)]
*  from inside the house quite literally [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=596.12s)]
*  from inside the White House. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=598.16s)]
*  The waste, the fraud and the abuse is coming [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=599.88s)]
*  from that lectern where Caroline Levitt is speaking. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=602.4s)]
*  It is coming from the Oval Office [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=605.08s)]
*  where Donald Trump is speaking. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=606.52s)]
*  And that's why a lot of folks are often like, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=607.96s)]
*  we get it, Trump lies, it's just a part of life, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=611.68s)]
*  Why do we need to continue to call it out? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=614.8s)]
*  It's because his lies are dangerous [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=616.24s)]
*  and they have tangible effects on the world. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=617.64s)]
*  You need to be calling them out [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=619.68s)]
*  because Donald Trump is taking the fraud [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=620.88s)]
*  that he has perpetrated throughout his entire life. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=623.0s)]
*  Remember all those civil cases, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=625.04s)]
*  remember all those criminal cases, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=626.76s)]
*  whether it be against him personally, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  against his businesses. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=629.76s)]
*  He was known for just making up numbers, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  making up the square footage of his apartments, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=633.0s)]
*  making up revenue numbers [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  in order to secure certain bank loans, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  just making things up out of thin air. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=638.56s)]
*  Now this is the exact way that he is running [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=640.88s)]
*  the United States government. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=643.04s)]
*  And too often reporters are taking his words as gospel [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  and they are parroting them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=648.52s)]
*  Now, thankfully there were some great reporters there. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=649.92s)]
*  That story by notice was fantastic. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=651.92s)]
*  The other question that we'll get to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=654.48s)]
*  that really set him off, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=655.76s)]
*  the taco question was fantastic as well, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=656.76s)]
*  but we need to continue to hold his feet [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=659.76s)]
*  to the fire on these things [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=661.04s)]
*  and to call out his bullshit [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=662.2s)]
*  because his bullshit is getting transferred over [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=663.96s)]
*  into real harm. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=666.4s)]
*  For example, what are they doing with this Maha report [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=668.0s)]
*  or however you say Maha, whatever this, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=671.04s)]
*  make America healthy again. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  They are taking these fake citations they made up. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=674.04s)]
*  It's clearly AI by the way, what they did. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=676.52s)]
*  They clearly used AI to write like the whole report. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=678.44s)]
*  And they are taking that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=680.6s)]
*  and they are removing the recommendations [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=681.6s)]
*  for people to get vaccines who are healthy adults, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=683.44s)]
*  healthy children, pregnant women, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=687.8800000000001s)]
*  stripping away those recommendations. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  And you could say, okay, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=691.5600000000001s)]
*  who cares if the government recommends it or not? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, insurance companies stop covering vaccines [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  when that's the case. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  And so you're gonna have people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  who are now unable to get the vaccine. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=700.12s)]
*  There's now a barrier put up for folks to get the vaccine [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=702.0s)]
*  at the same time that we are currently seeing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=705.2800000000001s)]
*  And I'm not sure if folks have heard about this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=707.72s)]
*  We are seeing outbreaks of COVID [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=709.72s)]
*  throughout the world right now [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  that are getting people pretty worried. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=713.04s)]
*  We have a government right now that is doing what it did [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=714.8s)]
*  last time Donald Trump was in office, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=717.64s)]
*  which is just closing their eyes and covering their ears [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=719.56s)]
*  to the reality of what's going on. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=721.76s)]
*  They also canceled a vaccine [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=723.64s)]
*  that was on the way for the bird flu, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=725.76s)]
*  something that's obviously been a huge issue. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=727.64s)]
*  Why did they cancel it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=730.0s)]
*  Because they cited their concerns over mRNA technology, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=731.24s)]
*  which is known to be safe, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  which is what the COVID vaccines are, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=736.92s)]
*  which is at the heart of their conspiracy theories [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=738.4s)]
*  and their lies that we continue to spread. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=740.8s)]
*  And that's why I think it's important [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=742.72s)]
*  that we constantly debunk this, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=743.88s)]
*  that we correct the record. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=745.48s)]
*  That's why I really like what we're doing here as well. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=746.52s)]
*  Thanks to everybody for your support. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=748.88s)]
*  We have the new Midas Health Initiative [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=750.52s)]
*  that we are doing here on Midas Touch with Dr. Vin Gupta. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=752.64s)]
*  And he is bringing in the most preeminent experts [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=755.76s)]
*  in the field right now to inform the American people [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=758.6s)]
*  as to what is actually going on. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=761.6s)]
*  Because right now we are unable to tell [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  what's going on with this government [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=765.36s)]
*  because they lie about literally everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=766.84s)]
*  By the way, if you wanna listen [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=770.32s)]
*  to those Midas Health episodes, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=771.16s)]
*  they're on the Midas Touch podcast feed. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=773.0s)]
*  You can just search them on there, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  but they're really, really fantastic. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=776.16s)]
*  Dr. Gupta just had Dr. Hotez on, Peter Hotez, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=778.6s)]
*  vaccine expert, a few pediatricians. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=785.0s)]
*  You need to listen to those episodes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=788.64s)]
*  They are really good, really in the weeds on this stuff. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=790.04s)]
*  But Donald Trump's fraud has consequences [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=793.12s)]
*  and the victim of the fraud in this case [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=796.28s)]
*  is very much the American people. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  It's you, me, it's your grandparents, it's your neighbors. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=801.72s)]
*  And it's very important [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=803.72s)]
*  that we continue to call this stuff out, Jordan. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  1000%, Brad, 1000%. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=807.0s)]
*  And to your point exactly, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=809.12s)]
*  this idiocy that we're seeing from the Trump regime [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  is having real world and real life consequences. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=812.48s)]
*  It's literally life or death for some people. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=815.32s)]
*  And what Trump is doing right now is just flat out scary. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=817.52s)]
*  Like just basic, scary shit [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=821.6s)]
*  that's coming out of this regime right now. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=823.64s)]
*  It's a cacistocracy, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=825.32s)]
*  Government run by the least suitable or competent citizen. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=827.08s)]
*  This is what's happening right now [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=830.2399999999999s)]
*  and it's playing out before our eyes. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=831.64s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy we're here. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  Just play the clips so you all could see [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=834.52s)]
*  what is going on right now [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=836.7199999999999s)]
*  and to not be gaslit by others [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=838.52s)]
*  and think that any of this is normal. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=840.3599999999999s)]
*  Because when you see Caroline Levitt up there, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=843.04s)]
*  I mean, chief propagandist, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=844.68s)]
*  it is just striking to honestly see that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=846.76s)]
*  I give the press corps some credit there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  I know I'm hard on them usually. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  They ask some good questions, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=853.88s)]
*  but then to see the responses from Caroline Levitt, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  like what in the Kim Jong Un, Ben? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=858.52s)]
*  Well, let me continue to make some of these exhibits [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=862.6s)]
*  even clearer to the Midas Mighty, to our audience. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=867.4s)]
*  So next, Caroline Levitt lies [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=870.4s)]
*  and claims that the budget bill [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=872.9200000000001s)]
*  is not going to increase the deficit at all. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  When on the low end, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  it'll increase the deficit by four to $5 trillion [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=880.36s)]
*  by its very terms of raising the debt ceiling [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=883.5600000000001s)]
*  a certain amount and will probably carry [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=887.36s)]
*  at least $2 trillion of additional annual deficits [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=890.04s)]
*  as a result of this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=894.2s)]
*  But I predict it'll be more like 20 to 30 trillion [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  that will actually be added [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=899.88s)]
*  in the short term, five to 10 years [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=901.44s)]
*  when all is actually said and done. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  So here's Caroline Levitt lying from the podium. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=906.96s)]
*  And again, just saying that we're not going [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=909.84s)]
*  to be adding to the deficit. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=912.64s)]
*  And again, how do you know she's lying? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=914.08s)]
*  Because she's talking here playing this clip. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=916.12s)]
*  Caroline, one big, beautiful bill. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=918.12s)]
*  The president says he's not happy with all aspects of it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=920.24s)]
*  What changes would he like to see be made? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=923.52s)]
*  And can this bill be both big and beautiful? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=925.48s)]
*  It is a one big, beautiful bill as the name rings true. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=929.32s)]
*  And the president, as I said, is currently working [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=933.28s)]
*  with his friends in the Senate [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=936.44s)]
*  who have some recommendations for the bill. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  Those negotiations and discussions are continuing, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=941.36s)]
*  but the president's ultimate priority [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=943.88s)]
*  is to get this bill back to his desk for signature. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=945.5999999999999s)]
*  And the president's priorities in this bill [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=948.04s)]
*  are non-negotiable in terms of the tax priorities [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=949.88s)]
*  he wants to see in the large tax cuts [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=952.64s)]
*  in the border investments that are currently in this bill. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=955.04s)]
*  He is not going to allow them to go away [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  So then she goes, and by the way, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=962.52s)]
*  even the questioning itself, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=964.1199999999999s)]
*  this bill is both big and it's beautiful. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=966.4s)]
*  And the big problem here, and there's many ones, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=970.5999999999999s)]
*  but it is masking the fact that there is basically [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=976.4s)]
*  this economic asteroid heading to earth, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=981.4s)]
*  heading to the United States [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=986.08s)]
*  that all the world sees right now. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  The Europeans see it, the Canadians see it, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=991.28s)]
*  China sees it, Southeast Asia sees it, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=993.76s)]
*  Africa sees it, Central America, South America, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=996.64s)]
*  Mexico sees it, Eastern Europe, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1000.0s)]
*  you think I mentioned Europe sees it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1003.6s)]
*  They're all saying, got it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  This Trump thing is weak and pathetic. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1009.2s)]
*  He doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  He can be outmaneuvered easily. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1015.24s)]
*  He's scared, he's outmatched, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1018.08s)]
*  and he's surrounded by a bunch of yes men and women [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1021.5200000000001s)]
*  who enable the behavior that allows him [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1025.8400000000001s)]
*  to be easily outmaneuvered. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1029.0s)]
*  I had the opportunity to interview [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1031.24s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1034.8000000000002s)]
*  and what he told me, and you can look at the ports, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1037.28s)]
*  following Donald Trump capitulating to China, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1041.88s)]
*  Trump's been called taco, Trump always chickens out. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1045.88s)]
*  Even though he capitulated in Switzerland to China, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1050.76s)]
*  he sent his trade rep, Jameson Greer, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1054.44s)]
*  and he sent his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1057.68s)]
*  to take the 145% tariffs and make them 30% tariffs. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  The shipping levels that we're used to seeing [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  are not happening right now at the ports in Long Beach [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1071.2s)]
*  and Oakland and elsewhere in the United States. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not happening, which means we're seeing [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1078.4s)]
*  the longshoremen, the dock workers lose their jobs. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1081.92s)]
*  We're seeing truckers losing their jobs, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1085.44s)]
*  and we're seeing a cascading effect on small businesses. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1088.56s)]
*  The jobless claims for the past month, 241,000, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1091.96s)]
*  that was more than what was previously estimated, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1098.4s)]
*  and it was the highest level since 2021 [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1101.76s)]
*  before former President Biden was able to fix it [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1105.96s)]
*  and create record job growth. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1109.56s)]
*  So basically, Trump has created in under 150 days, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1112.68s)]
*  the Trump economy, the disastrous one, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1119.16s)]
*  that he handed over to Biden during COVID and passed, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  and now we have him manufacturing that again, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1128.48s)]
*  and it's happening, it exists. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  And you have stupid questions, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1135.0s)]
*  do you think the bill could be big and beautiful [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1137.16s)]
*  and beautiful and big? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1140.4s)]
*  Well, the rest of the world looks at us and is mocking us, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1142.56s)]
*  but it's more than that, it's deeper. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1146.32s)]
*  It's also the rest of the world, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1148.08s)]
*  our former allies are terrified at us [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  because we can also be hurting them, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1152.76s)]
*  even though they're figuring out [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1155.28s)]
*  how to develop international alliances [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1156.8s)]
*  that basically stop the United States [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1159.2399999999998s)]
*  or isolate the United States, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1161.4799999999998s)]
*  but we're ignoring all of these things. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, let me just take off some other data as well. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1165.7199999999998s)]
*  Right now, student loan debt delinquencies are soaring [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1169.52s)]
*  because the Trump regime immediately just restarted [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1174.28s)]
*  collection efforts and wage garnishments [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1178.2s)]
*  and reporting people's credit scores. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  That means you have a ton of people [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1183.36s)]
*  whose credit scores are knocked down [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1185.76s)]
*  where they can't participate in our economy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1187.68s)]
*  Credit card delinquencies right now [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1190.2s)]
*  are at record highs as well, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1192.96s)]
*  which is gonna impact their credit scores, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1195.44s)]
*  which when the credit markets start to collapse, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1197.72s)]
*  there'll be a cascading effect. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1201.0s)]
*  When we look at the 10, 20 and 30 year treasury yields, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1202.76s)]
*  combined with everything I just said, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1206.8s)]
*  they paint a picture of a very unstable [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1209.08s)]
*  United States market. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1212.64s)]
*  And we're seeing kind of quietly [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1213.76s)]
*  the United States now starting to print more money [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1216.56s)]
*  than ever before as well, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1220.1200000000001s)]
*  which we know is also a cause for inflationary stuff [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1221.96s)]
*  and then Donald Trump brings in today to the White House, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1226.96s)]
*  Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1231.16s)]
*  basically to shake him down [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1234.72s)]
*  and to kind of bully him to lower interest rates [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1236.76s)]
*  such that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1239.52s)]
*  Jerome Powell, immediately after he left, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1241.92s)]
*  by the way, I bet you when he showed up, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1245.04s)]
*  he was probably thinking, are they gonna fire me? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1246.52s)]
*  What the hell's gonna happen? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1249.24s)]
*  He had to release a statement right away [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1251.0s)]
*  for the sake of the markets, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1253.8s)]
*  for the sake of avoid... [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1256.04s)]
*  People don't... [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1257.16s)]
*  There could have been an economic collapse today, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1258.16s)]
*  but he had to release the statement saying, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1261.04s)]
*  I let him know, I reinforced [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1263.64s)]
*  that I'm not gonna be basing my decisions on politics. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1266.24s)]
*  And here's Caroline Levitt being asked [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1269.8s)]
*  about what was this about? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1272.52s)]
*  Why did you call the chairman of the Federal Reserve? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1273.92s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1276.28s)]
*  The Fed says the president met with the Fed chair earlier today [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1277.48s)]
*  and we're making gives any readout of that meeting. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1280.44s)]
*  The Fed also says that they discussed the economy. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1283.44s)]
*  I imagine the president might've shared views [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1286.08s)]
*  on rates as well, but what can you share? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1288.36s)]
*  I can share with you that we saw the president [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1291.2s)]
*  and I both saw the statement [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1293.92s)]
*  that the Fed put out after the meeting. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1295.28s)]
*  That statement is correct. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1297.12s)]
*  However, the president did say [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1298.44s)]
*  that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1300.8s)]
*  by not lowering interest rates, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1303.32s)]
*  which is putting us at an economic disadvantage [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1305.0s)]
*  to China and other countries. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1307.44s)]
*  And the president's been very vocal about that, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1309.04s)]
*  and I've been able to speak to both publicly [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1311.16s)]
*  and now I can reveal privately as well. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1312.44s)]
*  Did he speak at all about his plans for that position [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1314.24s)]
*  or whether he would seek to move Jay Powell [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1317.44s)]
*  out of that position or keep him in until his term ends? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1320.76s)]
*  No. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1323.28s)]
*  Okay, that's very quick. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  And again, that interaction is not a normal, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1326.44s)]
*  not a normal interaction that should not have taken place [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1331.52s)]
*  to try to bully the chairman of the Federal Reserve. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1334.88s)]
*  And it should also be noted [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1337.3200000000002s)]
*  that what the Trump regime wants to do as well [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1338.68s)]
*  is they want to basically, they call it take public, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1341.68s)]
*  but it really means remove from the oversight [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1346.16s)]
*  and control of the government, Freddie and Fannie, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1348.8400000000001s)]
*  which deal with really kind of guaranteeing [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1352.72s)]
*  the home mortgages that are out there. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1355.68s)]
*  And so Trump wants to, this was in project 2025, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1358.2s)]
*  remove the controls that were implemented [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1362.88s)]
*  during the housing crisis and take those controls off. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1365.28s)]
*  And he wants to be the person [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1370.12s)]
*  to kind of dictate the housing market. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1371.76s)]
*  And so all of these things, just one of them [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1374.56s)]
*  can be a trap that could spiral the economy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1378.32s)]
*  Now he's set hundreds of these everywhere [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1384.16s)]
*  on the health side, on the economic side, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1388.24s)]
*  on the housing side, on the credit side, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1391.2s)]
*  on the treasury side. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1394.04s)]
*  And that's what we see now. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1395.52s)]
*  And that just exists, not to mention the FEMA side [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1397.52s)]
*  where he's cut FEMA as we head into hurricane season. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  These, all these things exist. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1403.36s)]
*  And now what Trump goes into is scapegoat mode. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1405.68s)]
*  Who, now that I've lied about 5 trillion, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1410.1599999999999s)]
*  8 trillion, things are gonna be great. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1413.08s)]
*  Now, who do I shift the blame to? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1414.84s)]
*  That's the next fate. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1417.0s)]
*  Who do I blame? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1418.28s)]
*  Who do I Fauci? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1419.52s)]
*  Do I Fauci Jerome Powell? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1420.92s)]
*  Duh. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1422.72s)]
*  Do I Fauci whoever was running FEMA? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1423.68s)]
*  Duh. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1426.72s)]
*  Who do I Fauci next, Brett? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1427.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and when we see like Trump do all these erratic moves, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1430.0s)]
*  it's as if he's following a playbook laid out by AI, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1433.52s)]
*  chat GPT, if somebody were to ask it, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1437.88s)]
*  how do we create a 2008, 2009 style crisis? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1440.28s)]
*  It's like he's following that playbook to a T right now [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1445.68s)]
*  and it's going to be bad. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  It's set up for absolute disaster. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1453.1599999999999s)]
*  And I also just want you guys to think about [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1454.08s)]
*  this split screen that we are seeing right now, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1456.12s)]
*  because it also gets lost in the mix of all of this stuff [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1458.6s)]
*  that is affecting all of us, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1462.04s)]
*  are these corrupt pardons that Donald Trump [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1463.52s)]
*  is rolling out every single day, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1465.52s)]
*  whether it's that reality TV show family [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  or the other stuff that he's doing. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, one of the big themes about like [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1471.08s)]
*  nearly all of these pardons are these are people [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1474.0s)]
*  who are convicted of defrauding people, defrauding banks, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1476.56s)]
*  evading taxes, stealing tens of millions of dollars, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1480.36s)]
*  and he is letting them off the hook. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1484.08s)]
*  And while he's letting his rich buddies off the hook [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1486.36s)]
*  for stealing tens of millions of dollars [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1489.56s)]
*  and evading their taxes, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1493.08s)]
*  he is ruining the lives of people who simply wanted [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1494.8s)]
*  to get an education by destroying their credit. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1498.48s)]
*  Now all the people, Ben, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1501.3999999999999s)]
*  that you were speaking about over there, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1502.32s)]
*  the folks who are now getting at the bad end of these, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1504.12s)]
*  this credit reporting, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1507.72s)]
*  because they hadn't paid their loans during this pause, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1509.52s)]
*  and now Donald Trump has turned it back on, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1512.48s)]
*  and now the credit reporting is all screwed up [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1514.3600000000001s)]
*  for these people, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1516.44s)]
*  they are going to try to get housing loans, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  to get car loans, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  they're all gonna get rejected, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1520.44s)]
*  they're not gonna be able to do that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna have high interests [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  on all of their payments that they're making. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1524.64s)]
*  It's gonna send them further into debt. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1526.92s)]
*  So he is creating this right now self-destructive cycle [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1528.88s)]
*  that is really going to continue until this ship is righted. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1533.3s)]
*  And it's not going to be righted under this administration [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1536.96s)]
*  and with this Congress. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1539.76s)]
*  And we're seeing it right now, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1540.76s)]
*  if Donald Trump wanted to codify all these things, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1542.04s)]
*  as Ducey said, he could do things through the Congress, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1544.48s)]
*  he could do things the normal way. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1547.3400000000001s)]
*  But the fact is, when it comes down to it, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1548.64s)]
*  Donald Trump and his people, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1551.04s)]
*  this isn't the A-team, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1552.24s)]
*  these aren't the people [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  who actually really know what they're doing. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1554.24s)]
*  These aren't the people who care to learn [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1556.08s)]
*  how to actually do things in the proper way. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1557.72s)]
*  Donald Trump just wants to scream emergency, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1559.88s)]
*  and then ram through all of his policies that way, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1562.32s)]
*  take these shortcuts and just screw our economy, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1565.68s)]
*  screw us all in the process. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1568.68s)]
*  We should also mention Elon Musk has officially announced [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1570.8s)]
*  that he is leaving the federal government, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1573.3600000000001s)]
*  he's left the federal government. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1575.2s)]
*  His time as a special government employee [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1577.04s)]
*  was up at the end of this month. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1579.0800000000002s)]
*  And so he says that the Doge mission [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1580.92s)]
*  will only strengthen over time [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1582.98s)]
*  as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1584.88s)]
*  Obviously- [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1587.44s)]
*  Elon leaving might be his most efficient move at Doge. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1588.28s)]
*  I'm gonna say that Doge, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1590.4s)]
*  I'm gonna put aside maybe the non-verbalized goals of Doge, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1592.76s)]
*  which is probably them stealing our data [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1598.68s)]
*  and all the other corrupt stuff [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1600.48s)]
*  that they did behind the scenes. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1601.8s)]
*  But by its stated goals, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1603.2s)]
*  Doge was the single biggest government failure [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1604.6s)]
*  maybe in our entire history, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1607.6s)]
*  actually ended up costing the United States money, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1609.92s)]
*  and any sort of purported savings [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1612.52s)]
*  that they may even claim are completely reversed by this bill. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1614.42s)]
*  And there weren't really any savings. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1618.76s)]
*  They actually added a lot to the debt [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1620.08s)]
*  and the deficit by even just what they did with the IRS alone, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1623.4399999999998s)]
*  taking away the folks who actually collected [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1625.7199999999998s)]
*  the revenue for the country. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  But this bill right here, for all those folks, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1630.1999999999998s)]
*  all those Republicans, all those MAGA influencers [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1632.4399999999998s)]
*  who've been touting all these savings all along, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  oh, look, we canceled so-and-so's Adobe Photoshop license [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1637.24s)]
*  and their Outlook license, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  so they couldn't get them, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1643.28s)]
*  congrats, because now you're adding [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1644.12s)]
*  trillions of dollars to the deficit. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1645.8799999999999s)]
*  And even Elon Musk is speaking out against you all now. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1647.7199999999998s)]
*  Even Republican members of Congress [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1650.76s)]
*  are speaking up against you. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1652.32s)]
*  And so now you find yourself in a weird place, huh, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1653.56s)]
*  MAGA influencers, where you now need to decide, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1656.22s)]
*  am I with Elon, this guy who I've been bragging about, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1658.92s)]
*  all these savings about, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1661.52s)]
*  or am I with Donald Trump who's lying to my face [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1662.76s)]
*  and saying this actually is a big, beautiful bill [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1665.22s)]
*  that's gonna both save us money [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1667.8s)]
*  and it's gonna grow the country? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1669.66s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1671.2s)]
*  You're being duped, you're being lied to. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1672.02s)]
*  And I've actually seen in the past few days, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1674.12s)]
*  surprisingly, some of these people go, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1676.64s)]
*  oh shit, they're reversing everything Elon did. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1678.84s)]
*  A false premise, but actually acknowledging that, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1681.72s)]
*  oh, maybe this guy, Mike Johnson, is bullshitting me. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1684.1200000000001s)]
*  Maybe Donald Trump is lying to my face. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1686.56s)]
*  And I don't have a lot of faith in that, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1689.24s)]
*  but hey, at least it's progress. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1690.88s)]
*  And I think it's important that we do point out [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1692.76s)]
*  that these people talk a big game all the time about, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1695.04s)]
*  we need to cut the debt, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1698.16s)]
*  we need to make government more efficient. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1699.0s)]
*  Stuff, by the way, all of us agree on. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1700.1200000000001s)]
*  But one person is lying about everything [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1702.32s)]
*  and is actually doing the complete opposite. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1705.2s)]
*  And it's why a quarter of our debt in this country, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1707.6s)]
*  plus all goes back to Donald Trump. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1710.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's why over the next four years, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1713.9199999999998s)]
*  that is going to explode, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1715.3999999999999s)]
*  that's going to balloon even further. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1716.78s)]
*  And then everyone's gonna be like, whoa, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1718.8s)]
*  how did that happen? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1721.36s)]
*  Oh my gosh, wow. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1722.76s)]
*  And it was like, yeah, because hopefully now, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1725.62s)]
*  given the fact that the Midas Touch Network [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1729.08s)]
*  is the most viewed network in the country, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1731.52s)]
*  people are recognizing this more and more and more. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1733.9599999999998s)]
*  But if you just watch the corporate news narratives, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1737.14s)]
*  it would be like what you heard [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1739.5800000000002s)]
*  in some of those questions that you're, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1740.5800000000002s)]
*  so can the bill be big and can it also be beautiful? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1742.3000000000002s)]
*  Could it be big and beautiful at the same time? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1745.0600000000002s)]
*  And I'm watching them, like what even is that question? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1747.3400000000001s)]
*  But I do wanna give a hat tip to the CNBC reporter, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1750.6200000000001s)]
*  and we'll talk about this when we get back, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1753.94s)]
*  who asked Donald Trump the question, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1755.44s)]
*  what do you think about Wall Street calling you taco [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1757.46s)]
*  that Trump always chickens out? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1760.4s)]
*  And you saw how angry he got. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1762.5s)]
*  And then he like described, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1765.06s)]
*  you mean I'm a chicken when I negotiate [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  and I make it 145% and then I say 100, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  and then I say 75, and then I say 30? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1774.1s)]
*  Is that what you mean? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1777.46s)]
*  You mean I'm a chicken? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1778.78s)]
*  No one thinks I'm a chicken. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1779.82s)]

*  Wah, wah, wah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1783.62s)]
*  To me, that moment will take on a bigger prominence, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1785.1s)]
*  I actually think historically, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1789.5s)]
*  because you literally saw you were dealing with like, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1791.5s)]

*  like a little man baby there. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1798.42s)]
*  And with all of his things, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1802.26s)]
*  we just have to recognize that no, no, no, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1803.94s)]
*  like when he believes that stealth, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1806.3s)]
*  there's the shapes you literally can't see him, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1809.22s)]

*  If you're like me, probably too much. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1913.98s)]
*  Now I'm so excited to share with you guys C15 from Fatty15, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1916.3s)]
*  the first emerging essential fatty acid [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1920.3s)]
*  to be discovered in more than 90 years. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1922.5s)]
*  Now it's an incredible scientific breakthrough [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1925.06s)]
*  to support our long-term health and wellness, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1927.42s)]
*  and you guessed it, healthy aging. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1930.1399999999999s)]
*  Fatty15 co-founder, Dr. Sam Kass, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1932.8999999999999s)]
*  Fatty15 co-founder, Dr. Stephanie Van Watson, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1935.7s)]
*  she discovered the benefits of C15 [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1939.1000000000001s)]
*  while working with the US Navy [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1941.18s)]
*  to continually improve the health and welfare [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1943.46s)]
*  of aging dolphins. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1945.94s)]
*  Now based on over 100 studies, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1947.6200000000001s)]
*  we now know that C15 strengthens our cells [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  and is a key to healthy aging nutrient, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1953.14s)]
*  which helps to slow biological aging at the cellular level. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1955.5800000000002s)]
*  Now in fact, when our cells don't have enough C15, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1959.76s)]
*  they become fragile and age faster. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1963.86s)]
*  And when our cells age, our bodies age too. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1966.1s)]
*  So Fatty15 is a science-backed, award-winning, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=1969.74s)]

*  Let's be honest, most jeans out there weren't designed [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2021.42s)]
*  for guys of varying shapes and sizes. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2023.66s)]
*  We're not all built like mannequins. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2025.7s)]
*  We've got muscles, different waistlines, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2027.34s)]
*  and zero interest in squeezing into something [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2029.1399999999999s)]
*  that feels like denim prison. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2031.1s)]
*  I used to dread jean shopping, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2032.8999999999999s)]
*  either too tight in the thighs, sagging in the back, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2034.66s)]
*  or stiff enough to double as armor. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2037.1s)]
*  But then I found the perfect jean, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2039.02s)]

*  and denkakis that look boardroom ready, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2082.22s)]

*  so idiotic, and so incompetent at the same time, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2143.22s)]
*  I'll show you the next exhibit [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2146.74s)]
*  because these all highlight, again, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2148.18s)]
*  different pieces of the overall puzzle, of the overall story. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2149.9s)]
*  So Caroline Levitt once again started attacking Canada. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2153.9s)]
*  Donald Trump attacked Canada's sovereignty earlier this week [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2158.94s)]
*  after King Charles gave that speech from the throne, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2162.3399999999997s)]
*  which didn't even mention Donald Trump by name, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2165.66s)]
*  but represented that Canada would be looking elsewhere [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2167.8199999999997s)]
*  for friends instead of the United States [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2172.14s)]
*  and the turmoil that Trump has caused in Canada [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2174.42s)]
*  and in the world. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2177.7799999999997s)]
*  And then Donald Trump, after King Charles spoke, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2179.06s)]
*  he did the 51st state attack the sovereignty [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2182.5s)]
*  of Canada thing again. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2185.2999999999997s)]
*  And he was like, if you don't wanna pay $60 billion [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2186.94s)]
*  for the big, beautiful Golden Dome, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2189.8199999999997s)]
*  you gotta become a state. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2191.7s)]
*  Then you won't have to pay anything [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2193.2599999999998s)]
*  if you become a state. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2194.98s)]
*  And again, that rhetoric right there [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2196.62s)]
*  is not just trade war rhetoric in Canada, rightfully so, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2199.18s)]
*  that's war rhetoric. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2203.66s)]
*  That's attacking the sovereignty of Canada [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2205.3s)]
*  and the Canadian people rhetoric. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2208.22s)]
*  That's Putin denazification against Ukraine rhetoric. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2209.82s)]
*  That's how it's perceived there. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2213.98s)]
*  Again, that's why tourism from Canada [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2215.58s)]
*  into the United States has dropped precipitously [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2218.14s)]
*  and American states have to basically beg, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2221.9s)]
*  please come back, please come back. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2224.94s)]
*  We'll give you all of these discounts. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2226.9s)]
*  And Canadians are like, nah, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2228.78s)]
*  as long as you still have Donald Trump running this [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2230.9s)]
*  and attacking our sovereignty, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2233.54s)]
*  you have a sexual abuser, felon, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2235.42s)]
*  and despicable individual running your country. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2237.54s)]
*  So no, we're seeing tourism from Europe, Australia, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2240.94s)]
*  just elsewhere saying, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2244.34s)]
*  we ain't coming to the United States right now, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2245.6600000000003s)]
*  which is also harming the United States. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2247.86s)]
*  But here's, words have consequences, okay? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2249.94s)]
*  So when Caroline Levitt speaking on behalf [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2253.34s)]
*  of the United States says this, it causes real damage. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2256.26s)]
*  Here's what she said about Canada, let's play. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  The Golden Dome is certainly a significant investment [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2262.9s)]
*  in our nation's national security and homeland security [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2265.54s)]
*  to protect Americans, all of you in this room, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2268.14s)]
*  from future threats. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2270.7000000000003s)]
*  And you've been out on, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2271.86s)]
*  have the Canadians been talking in good faith [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2272.7000000000003s)]
*  about paying to be in it? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2274.46s)]
*  I know that's just some interesting stuff. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2276.62s)]
*  Well, the president has certainly expressed [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2277.46s)]
*  to the Canadians how we are essentially subsidizing [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2280.14s)]
*  their national defense. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2282.58s)]
*  He brought it up in his meeting with their new leader here. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2283.46s)]
*  And as you know, we'll be traveling to Canada next month [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2286.14s)]
*  for the G7. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2289.14s)]
*  So I expect that topic of discussion [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2290.2200000000003s)]
*  to come up on that trip as well. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2292.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2294.34s)]
*  Now you think that that is how you're going to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2296.46s)]
*  win over friends and how you negotiate? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2301.02s)]
*  Like you think that's how you deal [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2304.7400000000002s)]
*  with other sovereigns. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2307.74s)]
*  And if you look at the way Donald Trump has dealt [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2309.02s)]
*  with all of these other countries, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2311.62s)]
*  he has zero respect for him. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2314.38s)]
*  The same way he has zero respect for frankly, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2316.18s)]
*  anybody other than himself. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2318.2599999999998s)]
*  And this is how he treats other groups [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2321.7s)]
*  that actually are needed and have an impact. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2323.9s)]
*  And we're our friends. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2327.3399999999997s)]
*  He just destroys them, these relationships. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2330.02s)]
*  And then when it comes to these deadlines [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2332.74s)]
*  that he imposes on himself, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2335.54s)]
*  he either blows the deadlines or extends the deadlines [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2338.06s)]
*  and then backs down. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2341.18s)]
*  So on Wall Street, these investors were making billions [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2342.58s)]
*  of dollars on what they called the taco trade [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2345.9s)]
*  that Trump always chickens out. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2349.06s)]
*  We've been talking about the taco trade here [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2350.9s)]
*  for about two and a half weeks on the Midas Touch podcast [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2353.5s)]
*  where we were saying, here's what they're calling it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2356.98s)]
*  And now everybody's calling him taco, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2359.82s)]
*  but go back two and a half weeks when we reported that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2361.5s)]
*  on the Midas Touch network. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2364.9s)]
*  Oh, Ben, I've got proof as well. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2366.1800000000003s)]
*  So I come with the receipts. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2368.3s)]
*  So this was like a few weeks ago on our show [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2371.9s)]
*  when Ben was first hearing about taco in his circles [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2374.46s)]
*  and he brought it up on the pod. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2377.42s)]
*  Me and Jordy had no clue what the hell he was talking about. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2379.02s)]
*  But I didn't even know what it said for. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2381.9s)]
*  I forgot that taco has an O at the end also. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2383.1400000000003s)]
*  Like what's the E? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2385.38s)]
*  Yeah, but this is from like two and a half weeks ago [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2387.9s)]
*  when we were away and when we were off site [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2392.02s)]
*  and you could see this taco thing percolating. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2395.38s)]
*  We know that Trump will cave, right? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2397.8199999999997s)]
*  It's just getting him to cave at the right price [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2399.7s)]
*  at this point, because Trump always caves. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2401.7s)]
*  I, what would they call it? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2404.46s)]
*  Taco, what was the acronym? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2405.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Trump always caves. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2407.8199999999997s)]
*  What's the E? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2409.58s)]
*  Every time, I'm not sure. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2410.4s)]
*  No, taco, Trump always caves. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2411.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2414.02s)]
*  He always caves, taco something. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2415.18s)]
*  They call him taco. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2417.8199999999997s)]
*  But I'll go back and think about whatever that acronym is. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2420.62s)]
*  I forget what the O is. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2422.82s)]
*  Trump always caves, always, I don't know. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2423.6600000000003s)]
*  It's your future self, Ben. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2426.2200000000003s)]

*  Hey. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2429.46s)]
*  There's no E in taco, Ben. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2430.3s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2431.5400000000004s)]
*  I come from the future. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2433.0600000000004s)]
*  That was the week we were in New York. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2434.86s)]
*  Brent and I were in the same hotel room. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2436.2200000000003s)]

*  That's when my back really started. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2439.94s)]
*  That's why I'm hunched on it. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2441.42s)]

*  I gotta say, it's pretty good that you know. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2443.1000000000004s)]
*  If you had an E at it, we'll let it slide this one time. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2444.94s)]
*  But the point is you were hearing about this taco thing [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2447.42s)]
*  for weeks now. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2449.5800000000004s)]
*  And so Ben, if you were hearing about this taco thing [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2450.46s)]
*  for weeks, then you know, if you have a president [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2453.66s)]
*  of the United States with responsible advisors, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2457.1800000000003s)]
*  you would think that somebody along the lines [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2459.7000000000003s)]
*  would inform the president of the United States [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2462.96s)]
*  about what investors are doing, what investors are saying. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2465.36s)]
*  But that is obviously not the case [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2468.66s)]
*  because we have a president of the United States [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2470.82s)]
*  who is shielded from all negative coverage. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2472.94s)]
*  He has a team around him who lives in this propaganda, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2475.7000000000003s)]
*  lives in these lies, who just lies to him, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2478.7s)]
*  who prevents any of these bad stories from making it to them. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2480.9399999999996s)]
*  A team that tells him when he loses a Supreme Court case, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2484.22s)]
*  nine to zero, that he actually won the Supreme Court case, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2486.8999999999996s)]
*  nine to zero. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2489.68s)]
*  And sometimes it leads to moments like this [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2490.66s)]
*  where Ben, the reporter was from what? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2492.9399999999996s)]
*  CNBC, I believe. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2494.18s)]
*  Megan Pescella. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2495.58s)]
*  Shout out to her. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2497.22s)]
*  I mean, A plus. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2499.62s)]
*  This is honestly, this is a ballsy question. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2500.98s)]
*  This is a really important question to ask. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2503.48s)]
*  And you could see how Donald Trump crumbles [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2506.24s)]
*  or how the taco crunches into pieces [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2509.24s)]
*  when Donald Trump is asked about taco [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2512.8599999999997s)]
*  and asked about Trump always chickens out. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2515.16s)]
*  I'll make a broader point, though. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2518.72s)]
*  Notice that the ballsy questions, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2520.52s)]
*  usually in the ballsy rulings and the ballsy this and that, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2523.3999999999996s)]
*  is usually coming from the people without the ballsy's. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2527.1s)]
*  Don't we see that it's actually the people who hold [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2532.68s)]
*  these ridiculous felon and all these people accountable [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2537.0s)]
*  are the women? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2540.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think, let me just make the case right now [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2541.66s)]
*  that if women were running our trade policy in our country, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2544.16s)]
*  I think we would be in far better hands. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2547.4799999999996s)]
*  And I can say that confidently right now, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2549.9599999999996s)]
*  which is why the Trump men fear strong independent women. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2552.08s)]
*  That's me going on a little bit of a side rant. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2557.8399999999997s)]
*  But let me show you the moment that the CNBC reporter [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2560.4399999999996s)]
*  asked him about being called the taco player. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2564.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2566.8s)]
*  a new term called the taco trade. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2568.52s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  on your tariff threats, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2572.48s)]
*  and that's why markets are higher this week. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2573.44s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2575.36s)]
*  I kick out. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2576.56s)]
*  Chicken out. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2577.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, isn't that nice, chicken out. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2579.08s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2580.84s)]
*  You mean because I reduced China from 145% that I set [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2581.76s)]
*  down to 100 and then down to another number. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2586.6800000000003s)]
*  And I said, you have to open up your whole country. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2589.1600000000003s)]
*  And because I gave the European Union a 50% tax tariff [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2591.84s)]
*  and they called up and they said, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2600.0s)]
*  please let's meet right now, please let's meet right now. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2601.6400000000003s)]
*  Then I said, okay, I'll give you till June 9th. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2605.2000000000003s)]
*  I actually asked them, I said, what's the date? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  Because they weren't willing to meet. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  And after I did what I did, they said, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2612.08s)]
*  we'll meet anytime you want. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2614.6000000000004s)]
*  And we have an end date of July 9th. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  You call that chickening out, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2620.44s)]
*  but don't ever say what you said. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2621.8s)]
*  That's a nasty question. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2623.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2625.2400000000002s)]
*  To me, that's the nastiest question. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2626.44s)]
*  Yes, we call that chickening out. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  You literally describe the chickening out part right there [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2632.0s)]
*  that you said that 145% tariffs against China [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2635.28s)]
*  was gonna make us so rich. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2639.64s)]
*  We weren't even gonna need the IRS anymore. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2642.1600000000003s)]
*  We were just gonna have the external revenue service [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2645.08s)]
*  because China, China was gonna give us [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2647.88s)]
*  all of the money from China. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2650.4s)]
*  And we were all gonna get rich. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2652.28s)]
*  Isn't that what Donald Trump said? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2653.6400000000003s)]
*  We're all gonna get so rich. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2655.32s)]
*  We weren't even gonna be, no more taxes everybody. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2656.88s)]
*  That's what you said. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2660.8s)]
*  And then you sent the trade representative, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2662.4s)]
*  Jameson Greer. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2667.0s)]
*  By the way, go back and look at Greer's background. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2668.48s)]
*  His whole thing is this term [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2671.4s)]
*  where he calls decoupling from China [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2672.96s)]
*  because the guy's a freaking weirdo. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2675.28s)]
*  We need a decouple for, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2676.96s)]
*  his whole platform is like making China crumble. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2678.4s)]
*  Like that's why this guy was picked, Jameson Greer. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2682.64s)]
*  So you send Jameson Greer, Mr. Decouple, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2685.76s)]
*  go back and read his papers. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2689.16s)]
*  We gotta make him pay, tariffs will destroy him. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2691.6s)]
*  Okay, and you send Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2694.84s)]
*  I heard all the Fox people, including Jeanine Pirro, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2697.56s)]
*  who was there cause she was getting sworn in [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2700.44s)]
*  as the top law enforcement officer, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2702.16s)]
*  the top federal prosecutor of Washington DC. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2704.28s)]
*  That's what that entire press thing was even all about. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  I heard all of them say, no, this is four dimensional chess [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2709.2s)]
*  cause we're gonna destroy China. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2712.9199999999996s)]
*  We're taking them down. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2714.72s)]
*  China had like 5% GDP growth last quarter [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2716.3999999999996s)]
*  and China made all of these deals [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2720.12s)]
*  with all of these other countries, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2722.12s)]
*  are as actually in a good position. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2724.0s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  What's happening right now? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  Xi Jinping doesn't even wanna talk to Donald Trump. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2729.68s)]
*  He's talking to other people. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2732.68s)]
*  He spoke to French president, Emmanuel Macron. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2734.48s)]

*  He's speaking with leaders of Latin American and Caribbean. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2744.12s)]
*  He's speaking to people. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2746.52s)]
*  He's just specifically not speaking to Donald. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2748.16s)]
*  And here earlier today, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2751.0s)]
*  And here's my Scott Besson. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2755.56s)]
*  You know, I mean, you tend to be a little bit, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2756.8s)]
*  they tend to be, I'm Scott Besson. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2761.8s)]
*  I live in Barbie's pink $22 million Malibu mansion. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  I live in a $22 million home in Charleston. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2768.0s)]
*  This is all going to plan, okay? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2772.08s)]
*  They're not getting back to us, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2774.24s)]
*  but it's all gonna be for the better, okay? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2777.48s)]
*  Okay, watch him here, watch it. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2780.3599999999997s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2782.56s)]
*  And what about China, specifically China [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2783.3999999999996s)]
*  and that obviously started in a different place. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2785.68s)]
*  How can you characterize those talks now? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2789.0s)]
*  I would say that they are a bit stalled. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2792.24s)]
*  I believe that we will be having more talks with them [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2797.08s)]
*  in the next few weeks. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2801.3999999999996s)]
*  And I believe we may at some point have a call [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2803.04s)]
*  between the president and party chair Xi. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2806.7599999999998s)]
*  So stalled, there was a time when the president thought [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2812.16s)]
*  that that was moving forward pretty significantly. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2815.4399999999996s)]
*  Again, I think that given the magnitude of the talks, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2818.96s)]
*  given the complexity, that this is going to require [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2824.8s)]
*  both leaders to weigh in with each other. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2829.8s)]
*  They have a very good relationship. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2833.2s)]
*  And I am confident that the Chinese will come to the table [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2835.48s)]
*  when President Trump makes his premises known. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2842.12s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2845.76s)]
*  What the beep did I just watch? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2847.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's insane. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2854.92s)]
*  What happened to 90 deals in 90 days, folks? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2855.88s)]
*  Just kidding, LOL. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  We actually have no idea [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2860.0800000000004s)]
*  when the hell things are gonna happen. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2861.0800000000004s)]
*  We'll see, we'll see about it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2862.44s)]
*  I don't even know what I just watched. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2866.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I mean that sincerely. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2868.6000000000004s)]
*  Like what I just watched right there [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2870.28s)]
*  is like a broken individual who I'm wondering [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2874.76s)]
*  if there was some Morse code going on with the blinking [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2879.5600000000004s)]
*  and if he was sending us an SOS. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2882.8s)]
*  Honestly, like if I were them, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2884.6000000000004s)]
*  but I'm a rational thinking human being. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2885.96s)]
*  But if I were them, I would take this court ruling [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2887.84s)]
*  in the court of international trade [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2890.1200000000003s)]
*  where they blocked Trump's tariffs. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2891.6400000000003s)]
*  It's on appeal, I stated, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2894.32s)]
*  we'll get to this in a little bit. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2895.5200000000004s)]
*  I would take that and just be like, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2896.88s)]
*  oh, there's nothing we could do. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2898.28s)]
*  The court blocked it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  I guess we can't do these tariffs [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2901.4s)]
*  because the market's actually like that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2902.68s)]
*  People are actually going to like the fact [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2904.9199999999996s)]
*  that the court blocked these tariffs. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2906.3599999999997s)]
*  I would just, you know, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2907.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump who blames things on everybody, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2908.8399999999997s)]
*  just blame the courts and stop this mess [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2910.6s)]
*  because people don't want this mess. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2912.56s)]
*  The irony of that whole thing also is too, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2915.0s)]
*  like Trump just pissed off the entire world [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2916.68s)]
*  only to be told that everything that he's done [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2918.8799999999997s)]
*  is completely illegal and then he can't do it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2920.68s)]
*  It's just the most insane administration [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2923.12s)]
*  that we are seeing. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2925.2799999999997s)]
*  And speaking of insane, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2926.6s)]
*  I wanna tell you something happened to me [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2928.24s)]
*  just really quickly because we posted here [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2929.52s)]
*  on the Midas Touch TikTok account, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2931.92s)]
*  you know, all these taco memes [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2933.96s)]
*  were going around the internet and they're pretty funny. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2935.76s)]
*  We should be showing this one throughout the show [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2937.76s)]
*  of Trump, it's like a tortilla that turns into a Trump face. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2939.8s)]
*  And there are a lot of images like this, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2943.44s)]
*  AI images, you know, Photoshopped images [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2945.2400000000002s)]
*  of people posting tacos and chickens [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2948.32s)]
*  and various things with Donald Trump. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2950.32s)]
*  So we did a post on TikTok about this [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2951.96s)]
*  where I just went through, okay, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  here are some of the memes that are spreading right now [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2957.6s)]
*  about Donald Trump after he was raging about, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2959.28s)]
*  you know, being called a taco. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2962.6000000000004s)]
*  Here's this meme, here's that meme. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2963.44s)]
*  Well, let me show you this. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  TikTok literally took the video down, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2966.36s)]
*  said we had, gave us a community guidelines violation [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2970.0800000000004s)]
*  if you could see that right there. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2973.48s)]
*  And then when I clicked on it, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  for why, it took it down because it said harassment [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2977.76s)]
*  and bullying as if I am harassing and bullying [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2981.0800000000004s)]
*  the president of the United States [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2984.2000000000003s)]
*  by speaking about taco memes. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2985.92s)]
*  So I appealed it, I think, oh, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2988.32s)]
*  it was probably just a bunch of MAGA people [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2990.04s)]
*  who mass reported it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2991.92s)]
*  That's usually how these things start. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2992.84s)]
*  Yeah, like a bot farm. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2993.68s)]
*  Yeah, like a bot farm. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2994.96s)]
*  So I mass reported it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2996.04s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2997.12s)]
*  TikTok within like a few minutes [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=2998.68s)]
*  says that a human being watched at a TikTok [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3000.44s)]
*  and that they rejected my appeal [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3002.8s)]
*  and that they are keeping a strike [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3005.28s)]
*  on the Midas Touch account. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3007.04s)]
*  So that could limit our reach. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3008.08s)]
*  It could hurt us from posting and you get a few strikes. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3009.36s)]
*  It could ban you from the platform. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3011.72s)]
*  All because we posted taco memes. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3014.2s)]
*  So I just wanna call this out also [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3016.52s)]
*  because that's a little chilling [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3018.08s)]
*  that you lightly criticize the president of the United States [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3020.6000000000004s)]
*  and you get put in Twitter and in TikTok jail. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3023.0s)]
*  And it's also a reminder, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3025.7200000000003s)]
*  make sure that you're following us everywhere [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3027.0s)]
*  because you never know what happens to these platforms. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3028.6800000000003s)]
*  The good thing is we will always have this podcast. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3031.32s)]
*  So make sure you add the Midas Touch podcast [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3032.92s)]
*  on audio platforms, on Spotify, on Apple podcasts. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3035.0s)]
*  That way, if anything does happen to us [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3038.32s)]
*  on any of these platforms, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3040.1200000000003s)]
*  we're able to hear from us directly. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3041.04s)]
*  We're gonna continue to fight back [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3043.0800000000004s)]
*  and we're gonna continue to call Donald Trump a taco [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3044.28s)]
*  if we wanna call him a taco [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3046.96s)]
*  because it's deeper than just this. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3048.36s)]

*  All right, Dan Bongino, Deputy FBI Director, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3478.76s)]
*  which basically is Deputy White House, whatever his job is, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3486.4s)]
*  but he's the FBI, Deputy FBI Director. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3489.2000000000003s)]
*  Used to be a far right wing podcaster. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3491.6400000000003s)]
*  Now he's a far right wing podcaster [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3493.6600000000003s)]
*  who's also the Deputy FBI Director. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3495.96s)]
*  It's very weird, weird stuff. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3498.28s)]
*  So he made a very bizarre appearance on Fox this morning [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3499.88s)]
*  where he just whined about his life. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3504.32s)]
*  And I wasn't even sure the purpose of this interview, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3508.12s)]
*  but he was there saying, it's just a really hard job. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3510.7599999999998s)]
*  It's really hard and I don't see my wife a lot [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3513.92s)]
*  and it's just very difficult. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3516.68s)]
*  It's very difficult for me to do this. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3518.68s)]
*  And so it's kind of like I'm divorced from my wife, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3520.92s)]
*  but not like a real divorce. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3523.96s)]
*  I just don't see her as much right now. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3525.12s)]
*  And it's just, this is a lot of work guys. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3526.64s)]
*  Here, play the clip. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3529.84s)]
*  I mean, I gave up everything for this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3530.8s)]
*  I mean, you know, my wife is struggling. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3533.36s)]
*  And I'm not a victim. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3536.16s)]
*  I'm not Jim Comey, it's fine. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3537.52s)]
*  I did this and I'm proud I did it. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3538.84s)]
*  But if you think we're there for tea and crumpets, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3541.04s)]
*  I mean, Cash is there all day. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3543.56s)]
*  We share, our offices are linked. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3545.76s)]
*  He turns on the faucet, I hear it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3547.68s)]
*  He's there at, he gets in like six o'clock in the morning. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3549.44s)]
*  He doesn't leave till seven at night. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3552.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm in there at 730 in the morning. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3554.16s)]
*  I, you know, he uses the gym. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3556.64s)]
*  I work out in my apartment. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3558.12s)]
*  But I stare at these four walls all day in DC, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3559.88s)]
*  you know, by myself, divorced from my wife, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3563.0s)]
*  not divorced, but I mean, separated divorced. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3565.44s)]
*  And it's hard. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3567.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, we love each other and it's hard to be apart. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3567.9599999999996s)]
*  But you're doing some great work. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3570.2799999999997s)]
*  You're starting out at the FBI. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3571.68s)]
*  You move in buildings. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3573.16s)]
*  There's a lot of change. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3574.04s)]
*  I just got one more thing. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3574.9199999999996s)]
*  Some guys would rather go on Fox News than go to therapy, I guess. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3576.7999999999997s)]
*  Such such a bizarre, such a bizarre phrase, you know, divorce for my wife. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3581.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, you mean I mean separated. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3587.68s)]
*  Separated still means something. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3590.08s)]
*  You're right. I'm sorry. Hold on. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3591.3199999999997s)]
*  If you are listening to this episode, thank you for the audio listeners. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3592.56s)]
*  So please go to our YouTube and watch that clip because he he looks awful. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3595.92s)]
*  Like it looks like he is a wind gust away from a mental breakdown. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3601.6s)]
*  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3606.52s)]
*  No other way to describe that. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3607.36s)]
*  Mr. Bongino, no one's forcing you to work to this park. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3608.92s)]
*  You could go home, go back to being a weird podcaster. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3613.2000000000003s)]
*  I prefer it. OK, I prefer you being a podcaster [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3615.6s)]
*  than for you to be controlling our FBI. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3618.56s)]
*  But I digress. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3620.56s)]
*  I show up in the morning and then I work. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3622.64s)]
*  And then cash, I hear him. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3626.04s)]
*  He's there working and then he the FBI director is working. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3628.36s)]
*  And then he leaves at seven. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3632.52s)]
*  And we want you to feel bad for us. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  What in the world am I? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3637.6s)]
*  That's a great point. He's just describing work. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3639.16s)]
*  He's just describing how everyone in society works. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3643.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's that's that. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3648.0s)]
*  What did you think? What do you think people do, Dan? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3649.56s)]
*  What do you what? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3652.08s)]
*  That's they're so out of touch with the American people. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3653.32s)]
*  It is just absolutely banana land. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3656.84s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3659.6400000000003s)]
*  A lot of Americans after they work that, you know, eight to seven or whatever. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3660.4s)]
*  First off, they don't get to go to the gym and get to work out in the apartment [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3665.84s)]
*  or where surely they get to go to Fox News. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3670.0800000000004s)]
*  They get to go to Fox News and whine about it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3674.0s)]
*  OK, then after they work that job, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3675.88s)]
*  then they work another job until four a.m. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3679.4s)]
*  in the morning in order to put food in the mouths of their children [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3682.56s)]
*  or be able to support themselves. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3686.36s)]
*  And they can't even afford a house. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3688.2000000000003s)]
*  But you're on Fox whining about being the deputy FBI director. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3689.92s)]
*  And again, that's who they'll be like, Yo, this guy's alpha, man. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3694.08s)]
*  This is these are some alpha people. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3699.32s)]
*  Him and cash. These are out. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3701.92s)]
*  What are you all talking about? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  This is this is just some strange, strange behavior. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3705.64s)]
*  And then Donald Trump will post a meme. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3709.44s)]
*  God set me. I've been sent by God. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3711.44s)]
*  You know, with all of these disasters, he post memes. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3715.04s)]
*  I'm on a mission from God and nothing can stop what is coming. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3717.72s)]
*  How are you doing? What what even is that? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3723.68s)]
*  And the fact that that will get literally zero attention, zero. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3726.4s)]
*  No one will talk about it. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3730.16s)]
*  I've been here, granted, our platforms bigger than the other platforms, but. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3731.08s)]
*  Could you imagine, could you imagine [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3735.52s)]
*  if former President Obama, I won't even use Biden, say former President Obama [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3739.0s)]
*  made a post with himself just once like that? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3743.68s)]
*  I would guarantee you just for that post, you could set aside [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3748.4s)]
*  Qatari Jets and you can set aside the big just that post. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3752.92s)]
*  That would be the front page story of New York Times, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3758.12s)]
*  Washington Post, USA Today. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3762.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, don't get me started on Fox. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3764.8799999999997s)]
*  It would be the entire day of Fox. Oh. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3766.48s)]
*  Yeah, they would they would call Obama sarcastically the Messiah, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3770.52s)]
*  because they would say that he was always acting like a king [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3775.68s)]
*  when he was president, when he wasn't at all. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3779.0s)]
*  And so now Donald Trump literally says things like he sent by God, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3781.8399999999997s)]
*  like he's the king and stuff, and it's just radio silence from their part. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3785.3199999999997s)]

*  you know, over these people getting pardoned. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3809.8799999999997s)]
*  Ha ha ha. He should do it more. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3812.08s)]
*  And I just took a moment. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3814.16s)]
*  I usually ignore like comments like that, but I just took a moment. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3815.3999999999996s)]
*  I was like, honestly, I was like, I feel bad for you. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3817.56s)]
*  Like you are right now cheering on. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3820.36s)]
*  Just think about what you're cheering on. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3822.32s)]
*  I want you to look at your life. OK, look to your right. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3823.6s)]
*  Look to your left. Look at your bank account. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3825.88s)]
*  Do whatever you got to do. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3827.44s)]
*  You are cheering on right now a billionaire who is bailing out [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3828.7599999999998s)]
*  millionaires who defrauded people to the tunes of tens of millions of dollars [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3834.24s)]
*  who committed tax fraud, who stole money from people. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3839.24s)]
*  And you are going, ha ha ha. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3842.08s)]
*  We owned the libs while you suffer. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3843.68s)]
*  And while this rich guy bails out some other rich people, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3846.64s)]
*  like I just feel bad for you that you think that that is like a cool thing, honestly. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3849.8s)]
*  And this whole entire brain rotted [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3854.6s)]
*  maga culture where they just celebrate everything Donald Trump is, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3856.88s)]
*  no matter how corrupt, I think all of it will eventually one day. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3860.88s)]
*  I'm not sure when, but it will catch up to them and it will be like, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3864.56s)]
*  you know, I don't know, defending, you know, the Bush administration, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3868.36s)]
*  like for Iraq or something like people will just be so embarrassed [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3871.7599999999998s)]
*  by this, by them. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3876.04s)]
*  They're they're cheerleading of billionaires, by them cheerleading of oligarchs, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3877.64s)]
*  by them cheerleading this utter and blatant corruption that they are seeing. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3882.04s)]
*  And so I just I had to call it out because it's just, you know, so so outrageous. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3887.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, I think one of the interesting things with Patel and Bongino, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3892.2s)]
*  Ben and Jordy, is they're like the dog that caught the car with all this stuff, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3895.4s)]
*  because for the past few years, what have they been doing? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3899.68s)]
*  Well, as podcasters, they could say, you know, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3902.2s)]
*  they've been saying whatever they want. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3904.44s)]
*  And they've been pushing all the, you know, Epstein didn't kill himself. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3905.84s)]
*  They've been talking about all these Epstein theories. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3908.96s)]
*  Now, one of the interesting switch ups that they're experiencing is, well, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3911.48s)]
*  now they're in the positions of power. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3915.52s)]
*  They have all the information. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3917.76s)]
*  It's all falls upon them. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3919.32s)]
*  So if there is indeed a coverup going on, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3920.92s)]
*  the ringleaders of the coverup are them. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3924.04s)]
*  And so now after spreading all this stuff over the past few years, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3926.52s)]
*  everybody's asking, so what actually happened to Epstein here? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3930.56s)]
*  What actually is going on here? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3933.52s)]
*  But like the dog that caught the car, they don't know what to do now. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3935.56s)]
*  So now they are trying to placate their base and they're trying to say, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3939.68s)]
*  oh, actually, he killed himself. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3942.72s)]
*  Actually, you know, we're not withholding anything, actually. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3944.68s)]
*  And now they're at the whims of their own conspiracy theory. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3947.44s)]
*  So I'll play just a couple of clips of this. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3950.96s)]
*  Here's Patel saying that he's not going to withhold anything from the people. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3952.48s)]
*  But it's interesting to see these people now with their backs [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3956.08s)]
*  against the wall after they were accusing, you know, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3959.48s)]
*  the Department of Justice of bad behavior previously. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3962.6s)]
*  But watch this. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3965.08s)]
*  The other thing on the Internet is the Epstein files. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3965.64s)]
*  What's the answer to that? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3969.12s)]
*  The answer to that is the same as everything else. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3970.88s)]
*  I'm not going to withhold information from the American public ever, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3974.12s)]
*  but I'm also not going to rush to get it out there [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3979.08s)]
*  in a format in which they can't rely on it. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3982.08s)]
*  So on the Epstein matter, any other matters, we are diligently working on that. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3984.44s)]
*  And it takes time to go through years of investigations, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3988.32s)]
*  years of political maneuvering and years of cover up [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3993.48s)]
*  to get the American people what they deserve. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3996.92s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to give them on everything. Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=3998.44s)]
*  They said that these files were on Pam Bondi's desk [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4001.76s)]
*  and she was ready to release them that day. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4005.1600000000003s)]
*  And then suddenly something changed and they ended up releasing documents [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4008.1200000000003s)]
*  that had already been released years and years ago. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4012.44s)]
*  Documents, by the way, which contain Donald Trump's name numerous times, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4015.04s)]
*  documents that showed Donald Trump in Jeffrey Epstein's little black book, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4019.28s)]
*  not only Donald Trump, but just about every emergency contact [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4024.08s)]
*  Donald Trump has ever had. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4027.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's bodyguard, his nanny, is this chef, is this. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4028.76s)]
*  Is every number that you could ever want to reach, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4031.4s)]
*  Donald Trump and other members of his family were in this little black book. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4033.6s)]
*  I'm not saying that that means that he did any bad behavior. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4036.84s)]
*  I am just acknowledging that this is in the files. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4039.72s)]
*  Donald Trump also in the Epstein flight logs at least seven times [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4042.6800000000003s)]
*  from the publicly released files. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4046.2000000000003s)]
*  So now we are seeing an FBI that was previously like, oh, yeah, we got the files. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4048.08s)]
*  They're on the desk. We're about to release them. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4052.04s)]
*  All of a sudden, the heat gets a little it gets a little too hot in the room, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4054.2400000000002s)]
*  I think, for Donald Trump. Right. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4057.4s)]
*  The heat catches up to them. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4058.96s)]
*  They go, no, we can't release them. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4060.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, wait, the 174 in these Epstein cases, which is Donald Trump. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4061.7200000000003s)]
*  You could Google who is 174 in the Epstein cases. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4065.7200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump, who at what place did did Jeffrey Epstein and [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4070.44s)]
*  Galeen Maxwell recruit their victims? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4074.48s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4077.4s)]
*  Donald Trump lived like a mile away from Jeffrey Epstein's house in Palm Beach. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4078.64s)]
*  They were literally best friends by Jeffrey Epstein's own admission [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4084.4s)]
*  on those tapes to Michael Wolfe tapes that we have played here [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4088.96s)]
*  on the Midas Touch Network. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4091.88s)]
*  And we interviewed Michael Wolfe extensively about those tapes. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4092.96s)]
*  He has hours and hours and hours of recordings. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4096.08s)]
*  And so now to see Trump's FBI be the ones who are involved [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4099.12s)]
*  in this sort of cover up now because they know that their boss is pretty [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4103.52s)]
*  closely tied to what's going on. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4107.12s)]
*  It is quite the scene to behold. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4109.16s)]
*  I'll just play this one other clip where Cash Patel wants to assure [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4111.32s)]
*  all the MAGA folks out there that Jeffrey Epstein definitely did not kill himself. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4115.56s)]
*  Watch this truth. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4119.4s)]
*  But there is a lot of conspiracy theories out there. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4120.28s)]
*  There are the Epstein thing. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4122.4400000000005s)]
*  You dealt with Maria, you said, as far as you know, he killed himself. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4124.04s)]
*  I'm telling you, he killed himself. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4127.8s)]
*  The other thing on the. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4129.68s)]
*  Now, it was people like Cash and Dan Bongino, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4132.28s)]
*  who were the purveyors of a lot of the things [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4136.6s)]
*  that they're now saying didn't take place, right? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4140.360000000001s)]
*  They they were the ones pushing it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4143.2s)]
*  And by the way, when he said, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4144.8s)]
*  no, it's taking a long time because of all the political maneuvering. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, who was the attorney general of Florida [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4149.64s)]
*  when Jeffrey Epstein was sex trafficking in Florida? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4152.68s)]
*  Who who who was the attorney general? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4155.84s)]
*  Oh, wait, it was Pam Bondi. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4157.88s)]
*  It was Pam Bondi. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4159.92s)]
*  Who were the federal prosecutors? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4161.12s)]
*  Oh, wait, it was a federal prosecutor who was in Trump's first cabinet. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4162.72s)]
*  Who that's a little bit. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4166.92s)]
*  Didn't Donald Trump say that Epstein is a great guy [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4169.08s)]
*  who likes women on the younger side? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4172.2s)]
*  Virginia Joufray, who was underage and trafficked [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4174.4400000000005s)]
*  and she died by suicide recently in Australia. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4178.16s)]
*  The way that she was trafficked was Elaine Maxwell, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4181.72s)]
*  who was convicted of sex trafficking, found Virginia Joufray at Mar-a-Lago [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4185.0s)]
*  and brought her over to Epstein. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4189.96s)]
*  She Virginia Joufray was working at Mar-a-Lago [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4191.8s)]
*  at Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking trial. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4195.68s)]
*  There was a witness, someone who is now a woman at the time was 14, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4199.28s)]
*  who went by a Jane Doe pseudonym, who said that she was introduced [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4204.68s)]
*  to Donald Trump by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4208.76s)]
*  So we actually do know like where those files are. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4211.52s)]
*  And it would actually be fairly easy to release them. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4215.2s)]

*  Multiple federal courts now, the Federal International Trade Court [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4524.2s)]
*  and a federal court in Washington, D.C., both invalidated Donald Trump's tariffs against the world. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4528.679999999999s)]
*  What happened from the Federal International Trade Court ruling, though, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4535.8s)]
*  is that the Federal Circuit Court stepped in and issued a temporary stay, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4539.92s)]
*  allowing Donald Trump's tariffs to remain in place and blocking this three judge [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4545.92s)]
*  panel order, because in the federal court for international trade, which is like the district [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4551.5599999999995s)]
*  court, it's actually heard by three judge panels. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4556.28s)]
*  So you had a Democratic appointee on that panel, but you also had a Trump appointee [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4559.32s)]
*  and a Reagan appointee. So of that three judge panel, two were Republicans. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4564.44s)]
*  One was Trump. One was Reagan. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4569.36s)]
*  One was a Democratic appointee. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  And they all agreed that Trump improperly invoked emergency powers to declare [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4573.36s)]
*  these emergencies against the world and tariff the world. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4578.639999999999s)]
*  So it wasn't some leftist radical court. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4582.04s)]
*  OK, which which is not what these decisions are in general. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4584.719999999999s)]
*  So anybody goes, oh, my God, this leftist court. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4588.5599999999995s)]
*  No, it was a Trump judge. It was a Reagan judge. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4590.5199999999995s)]
*  It was frankly any judge who looks at the facts. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4593.16s)]
*  Now, the problem, though, is, is that you have these federal courts [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4595.92s)]
*  and these circuit courts and the Supreme Court. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4599.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, don't get me started on the Supreme Court. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4601.599999999999s)]
*  But they apply this. We're in normal times. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4603.48s)]
*  So what they go back to is what's the status quo? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4607.48s)]
*  And they go, well, we need to preserve the status quo before the lawsuit. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4611.280000000001s)]
*  So the status quo before the lawsuit were tariffs against the world. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4616.4400000000005s)]
*  When in my view, if you want to preserve the status quo, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4621.08s)]
*  it's before the unlawful act, not before the lawsuit. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4624.76s)]
*  The status quo was there was not tariffs against the world. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4629.68s)]
*  And we've seen this time and time again with these court of appeals, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4633.12s)]
*  which supervised the federal courts and the Supreme Court. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4636.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. Whether it's the issue of the Trump removal of key people [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4640.04s)]
*  who work in all of these agencies, right. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4644.92s)]
*  The different chairmen and chairwoman of the agencies. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4647.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court will be like, well, we need to stay the ruling of the lower [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4650.04s)]
*  court because Donald Trump already removed these people. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4653.64s)]
*  So the status quo is their removal. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4657.56s)]
*  Now they got to spend a year and a half, two years fighting [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4660.08s)]
*  to basically get over the hurdle to get what I think is the status quo, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4664.28s)]
*  which is to have their jobs back. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4669.12s)]
*  So even though this stay is temporary, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4671.2s)]
*  Donald Trump now has until at least June 9th, based on the briefing schedule, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4675.5599999999995s)]
*  where these tariffs against the world remain in place, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4680.92s)]
*  then who knows if the court actually rules on June 9th or if it rolls over to July. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4684.28s)]
*  But to me, the status quo that you're saying that you're supporting when you stay [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4689.92s)]
*  is Donald Trump's implementation of the unlawful act [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4695.759999999999s)]
*  versus to me, the status quo is rewind before the unlawful act, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4700.839999999999s)]
*  because that's when it was normal. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4705.2s)]
*  And they try to be like procedurally, well, you know, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4707.12s)]
*  we have to do it before the lawsuit. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4711.44s)]
*  And again, that to me has these major ramifications [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4713.12s)]
*  where they normalize Trump's behavior. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4716.679999999999s)]
*  So right now, the status is, is that Trump's tariffs basically can remain in place [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4718.04s)]
*  because the order from the Trump judge and the Reagan judge blocking it, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4723.88s)]
*  that's been stayed instead of Trump's underlying conduct, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4729.320000000001s)]
*  which is clearly unlawful based on what that judicial panel said. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4733.4800000000005s)]
*  We'll be following this every step of the way here, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4737.72s)]
*  but you better believe that foreign countries are looking at us and saying, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4740.160000000001s)]
*  well, we what the hell is going on there? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4745.52s)]
*  This is not a reliable trade partner. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  This is some crazy instability. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4750.88s)]
*  And no matter what, what these judges doing, what the media is doing, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4753.28s)]
*  you know, who's what Trump's doing, what the mega Republicans are doing [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4757.12s)]
*  in the House and Senate, all that's doing is hurting the people [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4761.2s)]
*  and seriously hurting the people in the long in the long term. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4764.76s)]
*  And that's a real big problem. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4768.24s)]
*  And that's why for me right now, it's simple. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4769.76s)]
*  You fight for the people. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4774.88s)]
*  You fight, you listen and you fight for the people. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4776.48s)]
*  That's that that that's what it is. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4779.72s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do every day in the Midas Touch podcast. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iXG3kVbvE&t=4782.12s)]
