# Trump DESTROYS Vegas with BIGGEST SCAM YET
**MeidasTouch:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg)
*  Donald Trump, the bankruptor of Atlantic City, is back for his encore, no pun intended, bankrupting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=0.0s)]
*  Las Vegas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=7.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is causing severe damage to Las Vegas, which relies on tourism dollars. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=9.24s)]
*  As we've reported before on the Midas Touch Network, tourism from Canada, from Europe, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=16.88s)]
*  from Australia, and elsewhere is down significantly, reaching levels that are almost non-existent. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=23.16s)]
*  Now, Canada started the boycott of tourism in the United States and a boycott of all [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=30.64s)]
*  products from the United States. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=38.16s)]
*  That boycott has spread to Europe, to Australia, and elsewhere. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=40.8s)]
*  In addition to boycotting tourism to the United States, it is also obvious why tourists are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=44.92s)]
*  not coming into the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=52.0s)]
*  They're hearing stories about migrants being thrown in detention centers, not getting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=53.68s)]
*  due process, and being sent to concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=58.44s)]
*  And they're hearing about backpackers and tourists who are entering the United States, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=63.04s)]
*  who are being treated like it's the Inquisition, being thrown in detention centers, getting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=67.52s)]
*  strip searched, cavity searched, and essentially treated like criminals and deported, and being [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=72.48s)]
*  held for days and sometimes weeks in detention centers into the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=78.28s)]
*  So for that reason, tourism has declined significantly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=83.4s)]
*  Las Vegas relies on tourism dollars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=88.0s)]
*  Now, if you've traveled to Las Vegas recently, if you've been following the Las Vegas trades, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=90.68s)]
*  if you've been following what's going on at MGM, the largest employer in Las Vegas, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=96.64s)]
*  and following what the head of the Tourism Bureau in Las Vegas is saying, it is reaching [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=102.2s)]
*  a dire situation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=107.76s)]
*  Employees are getting laid off. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=109.56s)]
*  And remember, Donald Trump, as part of his scam, his scheme, his fraud on Vegas and elsewhere [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=112.6s)]
*  in Nevada, which voted for Donald Trump this time, talked about no tax on tips, no tax [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=118.88s)]
*  on overtime, no tax on Social Security. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=126.28s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump has not enacted that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=129.96s)]
*  Trump also said on day one prices would be lower. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=132.28s)]
*  He also said there would be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours and that there would be housing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  that would be so plentiful that you wouldn't even know what to do with it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=139.92s)]
*  But of course, it is all a lie. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=143.72s)]
*  I want to talk about what's happening in Vegas now, but I think to properly contextualize [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=146.76s)]
*  it, let's go back to the early 1990s when Donald Trump bankrupted his casinos in Atlantic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=152.48s)]
*  City. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=159.44s)]
*  About eight, nine years ago, the great investigative team here from the 90s from ABC, it resurfaced [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=160.44s)]
*  nine years ago and they reported on Donald Trump bankrupting these casinos. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=168.04s)]
*  Let me show you what went down when they talk about how Donald Trump started with this heavy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=173.56s)]
*  promotion and everything was going to be great. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=179.4s)]
*  Watch what happened when Trump went to Atlantic City in the early 1990s when he defrauded [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=182.36s)]
*  Atlantic City. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=187.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=188.4s)]
*  The hotel was advertised as the eighth wonder of the world when it opened in 1990. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=189.4s)]
*  One step beyond your wildest imagination. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=195.24s)]
*  A symbol of Donald Trump's meteoric rise as a real estate tycoon. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=198.88s)]
*  Filled with Trump's signature glitz and gold, it cost nearly one billion dollars to build. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  Is it necessary to build on such a scale? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  The scale, Charlie, is what brings the people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=212.08s)]
*  The opulence, the size, the everything is what really is going to make the Taj Mahal, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=214.44s)]
*  I think, the most successful hotel anywhere in the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=218.76s)]
*  But Monday at 5 59 a.m., the doors were locked at the Taj after 26 years, leaving thousands [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=221.44s)]
*  of middle class workers without jobs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=227.84s)]
*  So how did Trump's crown jewel go from this? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=230.32s)]
*  I'm really happy with what I'm seeing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=234.64s)]
*  To this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=236.88s)]
*  I got to show you a picture of what the casino looked like. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=237.88s)]
*  It was it was pretty remarkable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=241.72s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=243.24s)]
*  Now, there were people in Atlantic City who also had financial acumen, who were aware [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=246.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump's casinos were likely going to cause devastation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=254.28s)]
*  Whistleblowers, people who tried to raise the red flag. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=259.12s)]
*  Donald Trump got those individuals fired, retaliated against them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=262.76s)]
*  Let me show you one such story. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=267.72s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=269.36s)]
*  One man said he knew it wasn't sustainable. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=270.2s)]
*  Marvin Rothman, a gaming industry financial analyst. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=273.0s)]
*  And I said, well, why would you want to have three casinos? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  One is going to cannibalize the other. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=282.16s)]
*  Just weeks before the casino opened, he told The Wall Street Journal, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  when this property opens, he will have had so much free publicity. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=288.48s)]
*  He will break every record in the books in April, June and July. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  But once the cold winds blow from October to February, it won't make it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=295.92s)]
*  The market just isn't there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  These are the quotes that made Donald Trump angry. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=302.4s)]
*  Live it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=305.96s)]
*  What came next made headlines. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=306.76s)]
*  Nightline covered Rothman's story. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=308.44s)]
*  You apparently saw things with some clarity, at least as far as the Taj Mahal was concerned. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=310.4s)]
*  And yet, when you spoke out on that, you got canned. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump was so upset with Rothman's grim prediction for the Taj Mahal that he is said [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=319.44s)]
*  to have called up his boss and said either make Rothman apologize publicly or fire him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=325.0s)]
*  He fired me on the spot. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=331.04s)]
*  Rothman says what really worried him about the Taj Mahal was how he says Donald Trump [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=332.56s)]
*  had financed it with an extremely high interest loan. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=337.64s)]
*  The Taj would have to make close to a million three a day to break even. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=341.12s)]
*  No casino in the world ever had that kind of number. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=346.8s)]
*  But Rothman turned out to be exactly right about the Taj. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=350.6s)]
*  It could not bring in enough money. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=354.2s)]
*  And a little over a year after it opened, the Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=356.04s)]
*  And again, Trump's other two Atlantic City casinos followed suit the next year. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=360.4s)]
*  And then finally, this is a contractor who tells the story how Donald Trump destroyed [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=364.76s)]
*  the lives of so many contractors in Atlantic City, screwed them over after defrauding them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=376.76s)]
*  Had I known that Trump was going to take over the job, I would have never done the job. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=378.32s)]
*  He says the Taj job nearly cost him his company, which was contracted to provide glass, mirrors [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  and doors. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=389.6s)]
*  He promised if we did a good job, we would get paid. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=390.6s)]
*  He says Trump owed him over $1 million and he wasn't alone. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=393.98s)]
*  Rosenberg says Trump didn't honor the contracts of over 100 contractors who helped complete [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=398.36s)]
*  the Taj Mahal. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=403.44s)]
*  The man didn't pay us because he didn't have money. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  Bottom line. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  So that was Donald Trump's excursion into Atlantic City and doesn't look a lot like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  what's going on right now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=413.04s)]
*  When your car breaks down, you take it to a mechanic with no hesitation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=414.72s)]
*  You need it and it's not something that most guys can fix themselves. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=418.82s)]
*  And men should think the exact same way about ED. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=422.7s)]
*  But the reality is you might be hesitant to seek help. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=426.68s)]

*  So before the election, remember what Donald Trump was saying? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=529.82s)]
*  This was his message to the people in Nevada and elsewhere where he said that the reason [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=533.0200000000001s)]
*  the economy was doing so well before the election under former President Biden was that it was [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=538.94s)]
*  a fake economy, he said. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=544.6600000000001s)]
*  And the reality, he said, is that everything was doing good because of him. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=546.84s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=550.9000000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=551.9000000000001s)]

*  Some of the best, some of the best people on Wall Street are saying the economy is only [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=558.1s)]
*  good because they think, I don't want to say this because other people have said it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=563.34s)]
*  That's not me saying it, but they think Trump is going to get elected. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=567.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the only reason our economy is good. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  That's the only reason the stock market is up. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump was lying. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=575.82s)]
*  He was defrauding Vegas right there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=578.88s)]
*  Because all they had to do in Vegas also and elsewhere is just take a look at Donald Trump's [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=582.26s)]
*  own financial disclosures from the Trump media company that he controls. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=587.0400000000001s)]

*  In the clip I showed you, the guy was like, why would you open up three casinos? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=624.24s)]
*  It's going to cannibalize themselves. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=627.64s)]
*  It's very similar to Donald Trump. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  Why are you going to tariff the whole world? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=631.56s)]
*  They're going to retaliate and you're just going to screw Americans and make Americans [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  pay more. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=638.54s)]
*  Don't you see the parallels there? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=639.76s)]

*  Let's take a look right here and let's see what they've been saying recently about what's [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=696.88s)]
*  taking place. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=700.88s)]
*  This is from NBC3, Las Vegas right here. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=702.6s)]

*  Here's what they have to say at NBC. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=712.72s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=714.12s)]
*  Why are Canadians staying away from Las Vegas? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=715.12s)]
*  Could it be the rhetoric out of the White House or is it the tariffs or is it both? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=717.88s)]
*  Let's hash it out with the help of Nevada Independent reporter Howard Stutz. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=722.28s)]
*  Thank you so much Howard for being here and we have to think of ourselves here. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=726.84s)]
*  What is it going to do to impact the local economy here in Las Vegas? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=731.6s)]
*  What have you found through your reporting? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=736.96s)]
*  Well Kim, thanks for having me on. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=739.4s)]
*  What's fascinating was is that international, you know, let's go back to the pandemic. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  We were looking to try to revive international travel as fast as we could, you know, because [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=746.52s)]
*  that's a big component in Las Vegas back in 2021. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm really pushing for it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=753.72s)]
*  Canadians were still coming then. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=755.76s)]
*  That was one of the few international flights we had were coming in from Canada, you know, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=757.72s)]
*  Toronto and Montreal because of the connection. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=761.44s)]
*  And Canada is the number one international tourist destination, tourist market for, you [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=764.0s)]
*  know, coming to Las Vegas. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=771.08s)]
*  So we saw this huge dip in February's numbers. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=773.08s)]
*  International visitation went down, especially from Canada. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=778.36s)]
*  I mean, some of the flights like 15, 12 percent, you know, down. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=780.12s)]
*  I first thought it would look like the tariffs and I wrote about it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=785.1600000000001s)]
*  But a week later, I had Canadians reaching out to me saying, it's not the tariffs, it's [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=788.6s)]
*  the disrespect. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=792.84s)]
*  And you have to remember, this was in, these are February's numbers that we got in at the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=793.96s)]
*  end of March. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=798.2s)]
*  And so, you know, they said we're not coming to Canada because of the disrespect. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=799.64s)]
*  Like you said, the 51st state and all the red are coming out of the White House. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=803.48s)]
*  And that was the, and so we'll see now next week, we should see, you know, end of April, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=808.08s)]
*  we'll see the February, the March numbers. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=813.44s)]
*  I think they're going to be down pretty bad coming up, you know, when we see the March [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  numbers. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=819.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  So in addition to the fact that there are massive layoffs in Vegas, revenues decreasing [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=820.24s)]
*  significantly, I think the recent stat is Las Vegas visitor volume down 12 to 15 percent, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=827.2s)]
*  gambling down hundreds of millions of dollars, down about 15 percent. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=834.0s)]
*  Room rates are down in the $100 trying to entice people. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=838.32s)]
*  Things are not going good in Vegas. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=842.16s)]
*  Now, also it should be noted that the Las Vegas Review Journal owned by Miriam Adelson, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=843.8399999999999s)]
*  a major Trump mega donor also, just came out with an op-ed, scathing op-ed criticizing [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=851.52s)]
*  Donald Trump because Donald Trump, pardon, someone by the name of Michelle Fiore, who [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=859.12s)]
*  was a former Las Vegas politician. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=864.8s)]
*  She was referred to as Lady Trump by lots of pundits and she was convicted of funneling [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=868.56s)]

*  and to her own benefit. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=885.36s)]
*  Let me just explain to you what went down. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  It talks about how a Nevada newspaper owned by Donald Trump mega donor, Miriam Adelson, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=889.68s)]
*  has savaged Donald Trump's decision to pardon a Republican Las Vegas councilwoman who was [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=894.56s)]
*  convicted of using donations intended to fund a statue of a police officer to pay for her [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=900.56s)]
*  cosmetic surgery. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  The Las Vegas Review Journal owned by billionaire Miriam Adelson described the decision by Trump [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=907.28s)]
*  as a debasement of presidential pardon power in a scathing editorial published after Trump [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=912.4799999999999s)]
*  granted clemency to Michelle Fiore, a former Las Vegas councilman and Nevada state lawmaker. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=918.96s)]

*  wedding. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=943.52s)]
*  The newspaper editorial says the pardon which was brief and contained no explanation is an affront [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=944.32s)]
*  to the federal jury that heard her case and sends precisely the wrong message to public officials. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF7ka8PzYfg&t=950.48s)]
