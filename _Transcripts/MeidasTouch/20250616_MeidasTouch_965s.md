# Trump gets STUNNED as Army seems to DEFY HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s)
*  Donald Trump and his regime are humiliated right now based on what went down, not just at the dictator parade, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=0.0s)]
*  but the fallout as the United States and the entire world mocks the Trump regime, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=7.2s)]
*  how awful and bad it was, how low energy, how sparsely attended. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=13.6s)]
*  There was like no coordination, and it seemed like the military members who attended did not want to be there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=19.92s)]
*  That's a theme, though. I've been hearing a lot from a lot of our veteran supporters at the Midas Touch Network who were saying, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=28.4s)]
*  Ben, if our soldiers wanted to show up and march in formation and meet the pomp and circumstance of a situation, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  they would be able to do so. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=46.0s)]
*  So one of the things that I've been hearing is basically this could have been a subtle form of protest within the military [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  against the Trump regime for using them as props for Donald Trump's dictator birthday parade co-opting the 250th anniversary of the United States Army. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=54.36s)]
*  I mean, and you even saw people in the Army like they were holding drones over their head. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=66.68s)]
*  The whole thing almost looked like it was mocking Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=72.28s)]
*  And by the way, it looked like Melania was mocking Trump while Donald Trump was inconsolable. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=76.36s)]
*  I've never seen Melania look happier to see somebody suffering when Donald Trump was there right next to her. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=82.36s)]
*  So you have all of Donald Trump's sycophants in his regime trying to pretend that hundreds of thousands of people showed up when it was like less than 10,000 people who attended. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=89.96s)]
*  So you have the Department of Defense. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=99.88s)]
*  Rapid response, they write. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  We were honored to host hundreds of thousands of proud Americans at the Army's 250th anniversary. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=103.72s)]
*  America is the greatest country on earth, and they post either this Photoshopped image. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=110.68s)]
*  That's not what it looked like yesterday. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Go back and watch all of the videos I did. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=118.04s)]
*  I did it from every single angle. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  There was not 250,000 people there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  There were not hundreds of thousands of people who showed up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=125.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's communication director, Steven Chung, posted, amazing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=128.28s)]
*  Despite the threat of rain, over 250,000 patriots showed up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=132.28s)]
*  God bless the USA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  Once again, there was probably at most around 10,000 people who showed up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  But let's dissect this, shall we? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=149.56s)]
*  David Earl Williams III, a United States Navy veteran who served from 2002 to 2006, writes the following. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=152.76s)]
*  As a U.S. Navy veteran, I can confidently say the troops in Trump's flop of a military birthday parade weren't even marching. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=161.08s)]
*  They were casually strolling. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=170.52s)]
*  The lead soldier couldn't even muster a proper salute. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=172.44s)]
*  Then there's the lone soldier awkwardly holding a DJI drone above his head. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  It's equal parts hilarious and pathetic. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  You can bet soldiers around the world will be reenacting and mocking this mess during their next formation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=185.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the No Kings protest drew an estimated 5 to 12.5 million attendees, absolutely dwarfing Trump's bargain pin parade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  Barring any major health event in the next three years, one thing's for certain, Trump won't be doing this event again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=204.68s)]
*  And here's the video that he dropped of it here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=215.4s)]
*  Next up, this veteran writes the following. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=228.2s)]
*  Jake writes, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=231.08s)]
*  When military men and women in uniform march, they march with tight timing and in lockstep as sign of pride. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=232.04s)]
*  These soldiers couldn't be further from marching in lockstep. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=239.56s)]
*  It's clear that they don't want to be part of Trump's dictator parade and are just phoning it in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=243.32s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=249.0s)]
*  This account, Terry writes, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=263.08s)]
*  This parade put our soldiers in a bad light. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=269.56s)]
*  Not dressed right, no dress, no lockstep marching, with the cadence and collar. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=274.36s)]
*  Looks like the first week of basic training. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=280.92s)]
*  This one I saw go viral by Irvy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=284.44s)]
*  She writes, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Out of step. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=299.64s)]
*  And if there isn't a commanding officer leading the march, there's a designated point person within the ranks to call out a left, right, left if they notice disorder in the cadence. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=300.6s)]
*  So this cluster F of a parade leaves me with only one conclusion. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=310.84s)]
*  This was a silent protest. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=315.24s)]
*  A Foxtrot Delta Tango, if you will. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=317.08s)]
*  Speaking of that, Shannon Watts points out the following. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=321.48s)]
*  For the kids, the song they were playing during this dictator parade is called Fortunate Son by Credence Clearwater Revival, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=324.92s)]
*  which is a protest song that critiques the social injustices and class disparities of the Vietnam War draft system that Donald Trump exploited to claim he had bone spurs to get five deferments to not be drafted into the Vietnam War. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=353.88s)]
*  And the irony cannot be lost that as they're playing Fortunate Son, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=383.88s)]
*  Donald Trump saluting the army soldiers dressed in the Vietnam fatigues that Donald Trump dodged the draft and said that his personal Vietnam was his claim. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Proportedly, he says that he avoided STDs during the 1980s, which he says made him more courageous even than those who fought and died in Vietnam. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=421.56s)]
*  Here, let's just play that clip right there again. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=432.68s)]
*  Dating, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you got to say to a woman, hey, listen, you got to go to my personal doctor and I'm going to have you checked out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=435.8s)]
*  Is that a tough thing to say to a woman or you just got the balls to say it? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=440.2s)]
*  You know, I'll tell you, it's amazing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=443.0s)]
*  I can't even believe it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=444.44s)]
*  I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  You've never gotten a social disease. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  It is a dangerous world out there. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=450.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  Scared. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  It's like Vietnam sort of like, you know, it is. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  It is your personal Vietnam, isn't it? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=455.56s)]
*  It is my personal Vietnam. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=457.0s)]
*  You've said that many times. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=457.56s)]
*  I feel like a great and very brave soldier. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=458.44s)]
*  This episode of the Midas Touch podcast is brought to you by Graza. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=460.44s)]
*  It's that time of the year. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=464.2s)]
*  Whether you're grilling on the deck or chilling at the beach, Graza is your one and only summertime, never blended, single origin olive oil. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=465.32s)]
*  I love the trio. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=472.44s)]
*  There's Frizzle with a 490 degree smoke point. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=473.4s)]
*  Ideal for grilling, frying, or crisping. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=476.44s)]
*  Sizzle is your everyday go-to for roasting, marinating, and sauteing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=478.92s)]
*  And Drizzle, bold, punchy, grassy, and bright. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=483.0s)]
*  It elevates everything from potato salad to bread, even ice cream. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=486.6s)]
*  I've made some of the best salad dressings with that Drizzle, by the way. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=490.44s)]
*  And here's what sets it apart. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=494.2s)]
*  Graza is extra virgin, super fresh, single varietal, and always clean and pure. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  No blends, just vibrant, aromatic, traceable goodness from one olive varietal from one region. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=500.44s)]
*  Personally, I love the no-mess squeeze and spray bottles. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=507.08s)]
*  It makes cooking cleaner and quicker and with a zero mess. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=510.2s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I was so psyched when Graza came on board as a sponsor because as someone who loves to cook, I had already been the biggest fan of their olive oils. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=513.4s)]
*  Here's the best part. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=522.12s)]
*  You get 10% off your first order on Graza's site, but I highly recommend grabbing the trio. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=523.24s)]
*  Sizzle, Frizzle, and Drizzle so you're covered for every kind of cooking. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=528.6s)]
*  So head to graza.co and use Mitus to get 10% off the trio, which includes Sizzle, Frizzle, and Drizzle, and get to cook in your next chef quality meal. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=532.6s)]
*  That's graza.co code mitus, M-E-I-D-A-S. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=543.4s)]
*  So here I've seen this TikTok going viral where they made that soldier walk while holding a drone above his head. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=548.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  You can see here in this photo, Melania relishing, happy as can be at Donald Trump's suffering. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=563.24s)]
*  Here again, you can see, looked like a no show for Donald's birthday. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, I love this clip. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=578.2s)]
*  Maybe one of my favorite Trump clips of all time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=585.32s)]
*  This 90 seconds of Donald Trump absolutely suffering, but Melania could not be happier. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=587.88s)]
*  Watch Trump suffer as Melania is enjoying every moment of this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=599.32s)]
*  In 1914, years of escalating competition between European alliances culminate in the outbreak of the First World War. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=600.36s)]
*  The two sides engage in the savage war of attrition defined by opposing trenches, barbed wire, poison gas, and mass casualties. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=614.76s)]
*  The United States initially maintained its neutrality, but was eventually drawn into the conflict in 1917. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=624.44s)]
*  Despite having less than 130,000 soldiers at the beginning, the army eventually grew to over 4 million, with nearly 2 million soldiers serving in Europe. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADuYh4U7b1s&t=630.9200000000001s)]
