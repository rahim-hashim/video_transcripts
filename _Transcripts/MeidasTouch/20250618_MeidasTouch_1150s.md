# FED UP World Leaders DESTROY Trump as he RUNS FROM THEM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o)
*  Goodbye, Donald. You were not missed at the G7, as the responsible, adult, and very furious world leaders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=0.0s)]
*  had productive discussions on Tuesday in your absence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=9.84s)]
*  Donald Trump fled Alberta, Canada, like the coward that he is, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=14.32s)]
*  because he was too afraid to meet with President Zelensky at the working session on Tuesday, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=19.2s)]
*  or to meet with Modi from India on Tuesday, or to meet with the President of Mexico, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=25.6s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum on Tuesday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=31.92s)]
*  Donald Trump fled and ran back to the United States, and Donald Trump said the reason he did that is because [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  he doesn't like phones, and he says that he needs to be back at the U.S. because he hates using phone devices. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=41.28s)]
*  Take a look at this photo right here, and just look at this image. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=48.8s)]
*  All of the world leaders, the immediate G7, as well as the other nations, as well, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=53.44s)]
*  who joined for the kind of cooperation part of the summit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Look, nowhere is the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=64.96s)]
*  Normally, you would see the U.S. right there in the center, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=66.96s)]
*  but you see in the center Prime Minister Carney of Canada, French President Emmanuel Macron, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=70.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Pierre Stammer right there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=76.88s)]
*  All the way on the left, you have Friedrich Merz of Germany. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=80.0s)]
*  Next to him, you have Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=83.76s)]
*  Look all the way, all the way in the back left right there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=88.56s)]
*  Do you see who that is? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=93.2s)]
*  That's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who used to live in the pink Barbie Malibu mansion [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=94.72s)]
*  in Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=102.08s)]
*  Did you notice they put him all the way on the left in the back row? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=104.8s)]
*  Take a look right here, Olga Nesterova. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=110.48s)]
*  She does an incredible job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=113.12s)]
*  Take a look at two days ago, what the G7 leader table looked like. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  You see over there, Donald Trump seated on the right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  All right on the screen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=123.2s)]
*  You see next to him Prime Minister Carney, and next to him, French President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=124.64s)]
*  Look at day two. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=129.68s)]
*  They gave Zelenskyy Donald Trump's chair. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=131.6s)]
*  The real leader of the free world right now, President Zelenskyy taking Trump's chair. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=136.16s)]
*  No doubt they did that on purpose. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=142.88s)]
*  Now, I'll show you this clip right here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=145.44s)]
*  This was pretty much the last thing that happened before Donald Trump left the G7 early on Monday [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=148.88s)]
*  and was not there with the working group of the other nations. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=155.28s)]
*  Take a look right here of Italy's Prime Minister turning to French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=158.96s)]
*  and just look at the eye roll at Donald Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=166.4s)]
*  And look at Donald Trump from Monday. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=169.36s)]
*  Just how uncomfortable he looks there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=171.36s)]
*  How awkward and out of place he looks there because he doesn't belong to be there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=175.12s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=181.44s)]
*  So [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  now again, as Olga Nesterova posts, the G7 working group is beginning on Tuesday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=206.88s)]
*  World Bank is also attending. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=213.44s)]
*  Mexico is represented there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=215.52s)]
*  Although Claudia Scheinbaum was there, they had a foreign minister attending. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=217.52s)]
*  Mark Carney, the Prime Minister of Canada said, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=222.0s)]
*  Welcome everybody to the most important session of the summit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  That was clearly directed at Donald Trump for missing the most important session of the summit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=231.44s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron posted this, his meeting with Zelenskyy on Tuesday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron showing how adults behave. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=242.72s)]
*  He writes, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  German Chancellor Friedrich Merz posts the following, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=264.0s)]
*  Good to meet you here at the G7, Zelenskyy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  You can be sure we will continue our military support to your country. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=270.4s)]
*  We see the terrible images of Russia's massive strikes and stand in solidarity with your people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=274.56s)]
*  We will increase our pressure on Russia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=280.64s)]
*  This war has to end. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  And German Chancellor Friedrich Merz gave an interview where he pushed back strongly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=286.08s)]
*  at Donald Trump saying that Putin should be a member of the G7, that Russia should join, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=292.56s)]
*  and it should be the G8 and it should never have become the G7. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=299.92s)]
*  Friedrich Merz in this powerful interview says, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't let barbarian warmongers into the G7. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=306.16s)]
*  There's a reason Putin was removed, Donald. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=310.88s)]
*  Putin was removed because he was starting wars with allies of the G7 when it was the G8. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=314.16s)]
*  That's why we kicked him out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=322.0s)]
*  Here's Friedrich Merz saying that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=323.76s)]
*  We've translated it with the AI for you so you can hear what he said. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  Back then, it was unchanged for true. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=329.28s)]
*  We do not sit here in this format with warlords and not with war criminals. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=332.0s)]
*  And that's why it remains that Putin has no place at this table here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=339.2s)]
*  And again, we had world leaders meeting with each other, Prime Minister Carney [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  welcoming Mexico's very popular president, Claudia Scheinbaum, right there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  While all of that was taking place, you had Donald Trump making this post yesterday. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=354.4s)]
*  It is my great honor to announce that I will be putting up two beautiful flagpoles [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=359.12s)]
*  on both sides of the White House, North and South Lawns. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=364.48s)]
*  It is a gift from me of something which was always missing from this magnificent place. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And he goes, There will be the most magnificent polls ever made. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=374.0s)]
*  That's what a little petulant child baby is doing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=379.12s)]
*  No offense to petulant child babies who behave more mature than Donald Trump. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=382.72s)]
*  Here's what Zelensky posts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=386.88s)]
*  President Zelensky, who was at the working session, says, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=388.32s)]
*  I met with the World Bank Group president, A.J. Banga, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=391.04s)]
*  to discuss continued assistance in assessing the damage inflicted on Ukraine [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  and preparing the relevant reports I shared that Russia's attacks [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=398.72s)]
*  are becoming increasingly brutal and which makes it vital to intensify efforts [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=402.16s)]
*  in pooling global resources in support of Ukraine. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=407.36s)]
*  We paid particular attention to the development of Ukraine's energy sector [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=410.64s)]
*  and reconstruction projects. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=415.36s)]
*  President Zelensky posted this photo as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=417.68s)]
*  Addressing the G7 summit, I emphasize that Russia is ignoring every diplomatic offer made [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=420.48s)]
*  by the international community. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=427.36s)]
*  Diplomacy is in crisis. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=429.44s)]
*  There is one clear reason Putin has openly rejected every peace initiative. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=431.36s)]
*  Look at that table. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=437.36s)]
*  Donald Trump, of course, is not at that table. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=438.72s)]
*  President Zelensky goes on to say, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=441.68s)]
*  Today we have concrete decisions on increased military support, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=444.16s)]
*  new tranches of aid funded by frozen Russian assets, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=448.48s)]
*  and additional sanctions targeted what fuels Russia's war. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  It is important that partners are ready not only to support our defense now, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=455.92s)]
*  but also to rebuild Ukraine together after the war ends. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=461.12s)]
*  I thank everyone who is helping us stand against Russian aggression [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=465.2s)]
*  and who together with Ukraine is building a robust security architecture for the future. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=470.08s)]
*  Again, that photo posted where Donald Trump is not there, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=475.84s)]
*  but his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=479.28s)]
*  President Zelensky goes on to post the following. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  Last night, Russia carried out one of the largest combined attacks on Ukraine [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=484.96s)]
*  since the beginning of this war. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=488.64s)]
*  The targets were our cities, meeting ordinary people, ordinary families in their homes. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=490.32s)]
*  There were 440 drones, most of them Shahid drones, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=494.96s)]
*  and 32 missiles of various types, including ballistic ones and those with cluster warheads. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=499.28s)]
*  One ballistic missile hit a residential building [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  and went through from the top floor down to the basement. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=507.52s)]
*  Rescue operations are still ongoing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=510.96s)]
*  People are being searched for under the rubble. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=513.36s)]
*  In Kiev alone, there were about 30 locations where either missiles struck or debris fell. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=515.68s)]
*  Nearly 150 residential buildings were damaged in Kiev alone. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=521.04s)]
*  As of now, we know that 131 people were injured. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=525.36s)]
*  15 people were killed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=529.04s)]
*  Among the dead is a citizen of the United States. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  Our air defense systems were active across almost the entire country. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=535.5999999999999s)]

*  We must continue getting air defense systems and missiles [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  and move toward localized production in Ukraine. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=551.68s)]
*  It's an urgent need to save lives. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=554.64s)]
*  We must also take into account the cooperation between Russia and Iran on one side [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=556.64s)]
*  and Russia and North Korea on the other side. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=562.0799999999999s)]

*  and then transferring their production upgraded versions to North Korea. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=567.68s)]
*  This is a threat not only to Ukraine. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=571.68s)]
*  We are working now to develop and deploy [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=573.8399999999999s)]

*  Our cities and therefore yours. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=579.76s)]
*  We need additional financing to produce them. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=581.28s)]
*  These new interceptors are important for Europe, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=584.16s)]
*  for the Indo-Pacific and for Japan and Canada and the United States. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=587.04s)]
*  By the way, speaking of Japan, Prime Minister Aishiba was there [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=591.04s)]
*  and did not have any productive discussions with Donald Trump [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=595.92s)]
*  before Donald Trump fled the G7 to run back to Washington, D.C. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=599.6s)]
*  Also, the European Union did not enter into any trade deals with the United States, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  despite Donald Trump confusing the EU for the UK and telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=610.1600000000001s)]

*  starting with SNU. SNU Smart Sleeper is a responsive bassinet that uses gentle rocking [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=638.56s)]
*  and white noise to soothe babies to sleep. It can add one to two hours of extra rest each night [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=644.9599999999999s)]

*  It's the only bassinet that's FDA de novo authorized to keep sleeping babies [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=657.04s)]
*  safely on their backs. It's trusted in over 180 hospitals. And now companies like JPMorgan Chase, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=662.5600000000001s)]

*  Zelinsky says the following, and this is directed at Donald Trump. Even if the American President, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=718.72s)]
*  Donald Trump, now does not apply strong enough pressure on Russia, the truth is America still [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=724.48s)]
*  has the most global interests and the most allies. They will all need strong protection. We must keep [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=730.56s)]
*  working together with the highest level of coordination, not only politically and diplomatically, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=736.56s)]
*  but also technologically and through investment. Increasing weapons productions in Ukraine is the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=742.64s)]
*  fastest path to results. Russia continues to carry out terrorist attacks and offensive actions. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=747.92s)]
*  Together, we must continue urging Trump to use the influence he really has to force Putin to end [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=754.88s)]
*  this war. It was the US and Trump who proposed a ceasefire, the resumption of diplomacy. But Russia [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=760.72s)]
*  blocked every effort. The war continues because of Russia. From the start, it has been an [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=766.88s)]
*  unprovoked criminal war of aggression. We must not forget that. We must continue applying pressure in [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=773.76s)]
*  every direction, diplomatic, economic, military, to finally bring peace. And here's what a real [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=779.84s)]
*  leader, Prime Minister Carney, had to say with President Zelinsky by his side. Play this clip. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=786.48s)]
*  I'd like to start by condemning in the strongest terms, the latest outrage, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=792.08s)]
*  barbarism from Russia, and express my deep condolences. And those are the Canadian people [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  to the families in Kiev who were affected. This underscores the importance of standing in total [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=805.2s)]
*  solidarity with Ukraine, with the Ukrainian people. And we had a discussion last night [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  amongst G7 leaders. The President and I will discuss more. And then, of course, we'll have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=821.68s)]
*  the direct discussion in a moment together. But we underscored the importance of using maximum [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  pressure against Russia, who has refused to come to the table. The President has led, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  unconditionally, to come to the table in search of peace. And maximum pressure [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  includes financial pressure. And Canada is announcing today several measures, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  sanctions, first and foremost, against the number of individuals in Russia, against over 40 entities [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=851.3599999999999s)]
*  in Russia and beyond that are trying to contribute to the evasion of sanctions, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=858.16s)]
*  the sanctioning of over 200 vessels in the shadow fleet that Russia is using again to try to evade [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  these sanctions. That's the first thing. The second is we are providing additional military [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=868.8s)]
*  assistance, drones, helicopters, broader munitions, over $2 billion worth of assistance [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=874.48s)]
*  directly to Ukraine. And thirdly, we are dispersing the next tranche of the loan based on the frozen [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=881.6s)]
*  Russian assets, over $2 billion as well. This is our contribution. We'll be working with our European [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=891.04s)]
*  and other allies for their contributions to provide the support. And to be absolutely clear, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=897.44s)]
*  the support will be unwavering until we get a just peace for Ukraine and Ukrainian people. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=903.2s)]
*  And here you have Prime Minister Carney answering questions at the press conference [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=910.0s)]
*  after Donald Trump fled. What Canada is doing moving forward in multiple respects with measures [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=914.96s)]
*  to support Ukraine and its struggle in Russia's unjustified and barbaric war. With our international [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=920.96s)]
*  partners, we're launching a major new package of sanctions on individuals, on companies, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=930.48s)]
*  on vessels, the shadow fleet to exert maximum pressure on Russia. We're also sending [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=937.36s)]
*  over $2 billion in funding for drones, ammunition, armored vehicles to help [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=944.24s)]
*  Ukrainians defend their territory, as well as a $2.3 billion loan to help rebuild the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=949.84s)]
*  infrastructure in that country. And take a moment to reiterate our condolences, given the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=958.4s)]
*  barbarism witnessed overnight in Kiev caused by Russia. G7 leaders also reiterated our commitment [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=966.4s)]
*  to the pursuit of peace and stability in the Middle East. Make clear that Iran is the principal [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  source of regional instability and terror. And here Prime Minister Carney is again. Let's play it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=982.72s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Carney, JP Tasker from CBC News. How are you? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=987.76s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=990.96s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=991.52s)]
*  Thank you, JP. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=992.0s)]
*  How are you, JP? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=993.92s)]
*  I'm just fine. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=994.64s)]
*  That's good. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=995.36s)]
*  Couldn't be better. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=996.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=996.8s)]
*  President Trump says. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=997.84s)]
*  Sorry, that was your question. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=999.04s)]
*  Not so fast. President Trump says tariffs are simple and what you're proposing to resolve [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1002.08s)]
*  the trade dispute is complex. What's he talking about? What have you pitched that's complex? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1008.8s)]
*  Complexity is in the eye of the beholder sometimes. And look, we have mutual interests [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1014.16s)]
*  in security, border security and military security and in commercial prosperity. And [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1020.32s)]
*  we have a variety of paths of those discussions. The government of Canada is going to agree [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1027.92s)]
*  only to those things that are fundamentally in the interest of Canada. In many cases, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1034.96s)]
*  there's alignment with the United States. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1038.64s)]
*  And just so you see what a normal diplomatic interaction is, unlike Donald Trump who shows [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1040.88s)]
*  up and he's like, is your being the G8? Putin, I hate American cities. Democratic cities are the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1045.76s)]
*  worst. Newscum, Pritzker, I don't like America. That's Donald Trump. Let me just show you a normal [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1052.4s)]
*  diplomat, like my impression, normal diplomatic interaction. President Claudia Scheinbaum [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1060.5600000000002s)]

*  G7. You know, it was immediately clear from our first discussion in the other room, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1073.04s)]
*  the enduring value of the president's leadership and the importance of Mexico being at the center [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1082.56s)]
*  of international cooperation. And if I may, Madam President, I'm going to quote you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1090.48s)]
*  that there is no progress unless it's shared. And this is the spirit that the president brings, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1098.24s)]
*  that Mexico brings and that Canada shares with you. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1105.52s)]
*  Thank you. Muchas gracias, Primo al Ministro. Thank you so much, Prime Minister. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1108.8s)]
*  For this invitation. It has been very important for us. We value the relationship with Canada. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8v77Mbd0o&t=1114.0s)]
