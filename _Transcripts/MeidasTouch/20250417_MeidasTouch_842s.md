# Trump GOES NUTS in Public as Walls CLOSE IN
**MeidasTouch:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk)
*  Not a good day, Donald. Your regime is facing criminal contempt in federal court right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=0.0s)]
*  After defying a federal judge's order to not send migrants to concentration camps in El Salvador, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  you've got Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman AOC drawing massive crowds in Idaho, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=14.32s)]
*  Montana, Salt Lake City. They're all there booing you, Donald Trump, and cheering, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=21.84s)]
*  tax the rich. Want to know what else, Donald? Your tariffs are backfiring, you're crashing the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=28.56s)]
*  economy, CEOs have zero confidence in you, and China is mocking you. They are posting these memes [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  of you with your fat stubby little fingers where they're saying, oh, look who holds the cards now, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=42.88s)]
*  and they're not budging at all. As your chief propagandist, Caroline Levitt goes on Fox and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=50.24s)]
*  says, I am delivering a message on behalf of Donald Trump to Xi Jinping. Please give him a call. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=56.96s)]
*  Please give him a call. But I guess for Donald and this deranged, demented regime of his, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=62.4s)]
*  that means America is back. America is back, he says, as quite literally, I think we are in one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=68.72s)]
*  of the worst economic periods, and we're heading into an even worse economic period in the United [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  States history. But Trump's posting America's back. What, Donald, you don't think people can [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=82.0s)]
*  look at their life savings? You don't think they look at their 401ks? You don't think they can [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=87.04s)]
*  actually see the grocery prices going up or that housing is less affordable or mortgage rates are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=90.8s)]
*  soaring? You don't think people recognize that? You think everybody, Donald, has MAGA mush brain [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=97.12s)]
*  and gets their news from state regime media? No, Donald, people get their news from the Midas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=102.8s)]
*  Touch Network right now on YouTube. They subscribe here. They go to Midas Plus on our [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=107.68s)]
*  Substack. This is the most watched news network in the world, Donald. Sorry about that. Take a look [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=112.48s)]
*  at what the Financial Times is saying. Are they saying America is back? No, the Financial Times [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  isn't saying that. Are they some lefty radical paper? Donald, never thought of the Financial Times [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=124.72s)]
*  like that. Here's their headline. The economic consequences of a mad king. Trump's delight in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=129.36s)]
*  doing whatever he wishes in the moment is incompatible with stability and sustained dynamism. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=137.12s)]
*  Oh, I guess that means America is back, Donald. Eh, I don't think so. Here's what this article says. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=143.76s)]
*  We know that nobody can be trusted with absolute power, least of all the demagogues who seek it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=148.96s)]
*  The one good thing Trump's trade policies are achieving is to demonstrate that yet again. The [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=154.96s)]
*  world's challenge is to survive the folly. The US's is to end it. That's how they're talking about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=161.68s)]
*  you, you pathetic vile piece of trash, Donald. And I'm not going to hold back and mince my words [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  about what we think about you here. Zero respect. You deserve none. As you send migrants to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=174.88s)]
*  concentration camps and then claim that you won a Supreme Court order, nine to zero, when you lost, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  and then you have Pam Bondi, your attorney general, have the audacity to say that Abrego Garcia's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=186.88s)]
*  family is better off without their dad, that the kids are better off without their father, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=194.88s)]
*  that the wife is better off without her husband who had no criminal history. Y'all are a bunch of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=200.96s)]
*  sick, pathetic. I'll just leave that. Here's Pam Bondi, Donald Trump's attorney general. Play this clip. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=208.16s)]
*  Maryland is safer because he is gone and that woman that he is married to and that child he [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=214.88s)]
*  had with her, they are safer tonight because he is out of our country and sitting in El Salvador [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=221.6s)]
*  where he belongs. Okay, so we're 72 days into trading and the S&P 500, Donald. Is this America [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=229.68s)]
*  being great? Because we are now in our fifth worst start to a year in history, only really behind [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=236.96s)]
*  2001, September 11, 2020, COVID-19, 1932 post-Great Depression. But I guess for Donald [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=244.56s)]
*  and the White House and the U.S. Department of Labor, this is Americans being great right here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=252.32s)]
*  Photos of miners with their faces covered from the mines and the Trump regime is saying, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=258.72s)]
*  this is what we want more of, more coal, more, that's what you're saying. How about we get [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=266.72s)]
*  Americans higher paying jobs? How about we get Americans working in safe jobs? How about we have [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  America lead the world in new cutting edge technology? How about we help people like that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  afford homes, Donald? How about we focus on what you promised, which you've lied about because [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=283.44s)]
*  you're a fraud in every single thing that you do, a deranged one too. Donald Trump posting, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=289.52s)]
*  can you believe it? A judge ruled against us. Wow, wow, wow. I'm not even going to read the thing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=294.88s)]
*  because it's just whining and whining and more whining right here. I've never just seen any [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=299.04s)]
*  adult behave like this other than Donald. And just think about what a sick, demented human that he [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  is. Right by now, he knows because we're in Thursday now when I'm recording this, he knows [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=312.0s)]
*  that the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, was targeted in an assassination attempt where [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=318.72s)]
*  the governor's residence was burned in the arson attempt and the attempted murderer had a hammer [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=324.96s)]
*  to try to kill Shapiro on the first night of Passover. Right? Has governor Shapiro heard from [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump? No, former president Biden sent his deepest condolences to the governor. But here's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  what we're learning. Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro says he hasn't heard from Trump since the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=347.76s)]
*  arson attack. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. How difficult is it, Donald, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=353.68s)]
*  for you to show some sort of sympathy or empathy or anything? For Donald Trump, because he's a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=361.44s)]
*  deranged, demented maniac, he can't. Suffering is the point. Here was Donald Trump on Air Force One [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=367.76s)]
*  several days ago when he was asked about the assassination attempt. So he's on notice of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=376.0s)]
*  what's happening, but he don't give a crap because he's a crappy human being. You just have to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=381.28s)]
*  accept that about him. He is a crappy human being. Here's what he said. Play this clip. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, did you have any reaction to the governor of Pennsylvania, his mansion, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=391.68s)]
*  set on fire? Did you have any reaction? I just heard about it. No, I have to look into it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=395.2s)]
*  You got the perfect health report. All of our, all, all, everybody in the press wants to know this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  How do you do it, Mr. President? Yes, this crappy human being is the same person who has denied [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=404.0s)]
*  federal funding for additional help to North Carolina for Hurricane Helene relief. He's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=409.6s)]
*  denied additional help for debris clearing. He's denied additional FEMA help to the state of Georgia [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=418.8s)]
*  for debris clearing. I mean, who, who denies that? Meanwhile, I mean, Trump does and Musk, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=426.32s)]
*  while they're out there, what, what do they do? They're, they're talking more about the gold card [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=432.32s)]
*  and that guy who from Musk's team who called the 19 year old, a 21 year old guy who calls himself [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Big Balls. They're working on the Trump gold card that they're going to sell for $5 million [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=442.88s)]
*  to the Russian oligarchs and the Chinese oligarchs. These are, these are deranged people. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  By the way, have you heard Donald Trump talk about this at all? Have you heard anybody really talk [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=454.32s)]
*  about this at all? Since the headline was announced that two service members were killed near the US [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=458.64s)]
*  Mexico border in a vehicle accident and a third service member involved in the accident remains [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=464.56s)]
*  in critical condition. These service members were sent to the border on behalf of the Trump regime [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=470.88s)]
*  for their performative, pretending there's a war that's raging right now so they can say there's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=477.44s)]
*  an invasion. Two died, one critically injured, our, our armed services, our troops. And does [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=484.32s)]
*  Donald Trump say a thing? No, just like he didn't say anything about the American soldiers who died [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=492.96s)]
*  in Lithuania. He doesn't care. He doesn't give a crap. He has no connection to what this country [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=499.2s)]
*  is all about. In fact, he hates this country and his action show every day. Why wouldn't you put a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=506.56s)]
*  message about these soldiers who died that you sent to the Mexican border? Why wouldn't you put a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=512.24s)]
*  message about the soldiers who died in Lithuania? Because Trump has said that people who are injured [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=517.68s)]
*  or die in war are suckers and losers. We know Trump's pathology. He's a sick, demented person, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=524.24s)]
*  but he's also a weak person. Here his regime is. Here's Caroline Levitt begging, begging China, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=531.6s)]
*  please give him a call. Here, play this clip. And China knows that too, Sean. And as President Trump [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  directed me to say yesterday, it remains true tonight, the ball is in China's court. They need [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=544.64s)]
*  to do business with the United States. They need the best thing on the face of the planet. And that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=549.52s)]
*  is the American consumer. And we have, we are the best place in the world to do business. The rest [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=554.08s)]
*  of the world knows that. And that's why Japan was here today to negotiate a trade deal. And while [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=560.08s)]
*  that's happening as well, you then also have Kevin McCarthy. Sometimes I forget how spying, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't forget how spineless this guy is. The disgraced former speaker of the house, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=569.76s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy goes on Fox because one of Fox's themes right now is that the crashing of the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=574.48s)]
*  economy is not Trump's fault. It is the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell's fault, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=580.32s)]
*  because chairman Powell talked about what's happening in the economy when he spoke in a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=588.08s)]
*  speech that he gave yesterday. So as a result of that, the Trump regime says it's Powell's fault. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=594.96s)]
*  It's the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He's doing it by speaking about the conditions of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=600.72s)]
*  the economy caused by Trump's disastrous trade war. This is the message on Fox and that McCarthy's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=606.48s)]
*  spewing. Here, play this clip. Kevin, I want to talk about what Jerome Powell did today. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  He essentially came out and said that these tariffs, which the Democrats are going to seize [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  on obviously, that the tariffs are going to likely to create some type of recession and that will [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  hurt US growth forecasts going forward, which I mean, there's a, obviously the Trump administration [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=630.32s)]
*  thinks the exact opposite about how these tariffs will work. But of course, that sent the market way [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  down and you can kind of see this little game playing out between Powell and the Trump [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  administration. Do you think the Trump administration needs to come out in a full-throated manner [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  and refute what the Fed chair said today about an issue that is still number one on the minds of all [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=654.88s)]
*  voters now and will be on the midterms? Well, what he said is hurting the economy. The market reacts [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=660.9599999999999s)]
*  to what he said. Now he only has a short amount of time left in this job and I think there's some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  excellent people who can take this job going forward. But remember what president Trump has [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=671.52s)]
*  already done. If you want to look at pure economics, he's getting people to invest billions of dollars [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgo11szemk&t=675.92s)]
