# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump has AWFUL FRIDAY
**MeidasTouch:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518)
*  Seems like all hell is breaking loose today as Donald Trump got very bad news, bad economic data. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=0.0s)]
*  Disastrous, one might say. Inflation is now spiking to 2.7% in May. That's worse than expected. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=7.04s)]
*  Income is falling 0.4%. GDP is shrinking 0.5% in Q1. It was revised downward. And consumer spending [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=15.92s)]
*  is dropping 0.1%. Donald Trump is freaking out. He held a whole press conference, and I'll cover [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=25.92s)]
*  the press conference in a little bit. But he's been attacking Canada, lashing out at Canada [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=31.92s)]
*  this morning and saying, all discussions with Canada are off. We are going to tariff the hell [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=38.72s)]
*  out of Canada. I'll show you that in a moment as well. And he's also telling the Ayatollah of Iran, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=44.64s)]
*  I saved you from a very ugly and ignominious death. You owe me. Stop saying that you beat us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=51.44s)]
*  That is a very mean thing. I'll go and show you his post. Meanwhile, Iran has fully pulled out of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=59.6s)]
*  the IAEA cooperation deals and inspections as a result of the strikes against Iran, which we now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  know from US intelligence, European intelligence, and others were not as effective as the Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=75.12s)]
*  regime had claimed. Economist Justin Wolfers over at the University of Michigan, though, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=81.36s)]
*  says the following. It's quite rare for consumer spending to fall in inflation-adjusted terms. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=87.12s)]
*  It happened during COVID and during the financial crisis, and it is happening now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=95.84s)]
*  Wolfers also points out that it seems, he puts it as a question, but it seems that we're starting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=101.36s)]
*  to see the first signs in official data of tariff-fueled inflation. And you can see [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=106.64s)]
*  the inflation rising again with that bad report in May. Meanwhile, as you go to Donald Trump's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=114.64s)]
*  social media platform, you see things like this. This is, I guess, how the social media platform [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=119.92s)]
*  tries to earn revenue, but as you know, truth social and Trump media has been losing massive [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=126.08s)]
*  amounts of money. I think like last year, lost like hundreds of millions of dollars, huge losses on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=131.6s)]
*  like $4 million in revenue. Trump's $150 trillion gift to America. As I look at this photo, I still [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=136.8s)]
*  don't know what this thing is by his ears right there, but it's just grift after grift, it seems, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=145.04s)]
*  in my opinion. Now, Donald Trump posts the following about Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=150.56s)]
*  of Iran. He goes, why would the so-called supreme leader, he puts that in quotes, Ayatollah Ali [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=156.88s)]
*  Khomeini of the war-torn country of Iran say so blatantly and foolishly that he won the war with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=164.16s)]
*  Israel when he knows his statement is a lie? It is not so. As a man of great faith, he is not supposed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  to lie. His country was decimated. His three evil nuclear sites were obliterated, he puts that in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=177.84s)]
*  caps, and I knew exactly where he was sheltered and would not let Israel or the U.S. Armed Forces, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=185.36s)]
*  by far the greatest, most powerful in the world, terminate his life. I saved him from a very ugly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=192.24s)]
*  and ignominious death and he does not have to say thank you, President Trump. In fact, in the final [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=198.8s)]
*  act of war, I demanded that Israel bring back a very large group of planes which were heading [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=205.36s)]
*  directly to Tehran, looking for a big day, perhaps the final knockout! Tremendous damage would have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=211.84s)]
*  ensued and many Iranians would have been killed. It was going to be the biggest attack of the war, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=219.52s)]
*  by far. During the last few days, I was working on the possible removal of sanctions and other [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=224.24s)]
*  things which would have given a much better chance to Iran at a full, fast, and complete victory. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=229.44s)]
*  The sanctions are biting, but no, instead, I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred, and disgust, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=235.84s)]
*  and immediately dropped all work on sanction relief and more. Iran has to get back into the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=243.28s)]
*  world order flow. What the hell in the world is he even talking about there? Then he says that he's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=248.88s)]
*  ending all trade discussions with Canada and will be levying more tariffs against them in the next [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  seven days. We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult country to trade with, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=261.6s)]
*  including the fact that they have charged our farmers as much as 400% tariffs for years [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=267.6s)]
*  on dairy products, has just announced that they are putting on digital services tax on our American [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=275.68s)]
*  technology companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our country. They are obviously [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=281.6s)]
*  copying the European Union, which has done the same thing and is currently under discussion with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  us also. Based on this egregious tax, we are hereby terminating all discussions on trade with Canada. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=292.72s)]
*  Effective immediately, we will let Canada know the tariff that they will be paying to do business [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  with the United States of America within the next seven-day period. Thank you for your attention to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  this matter. So it's not two weeks. It's a seven-day period. All trade discussions are off with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=310.72s)]
*  Canada. And do you see how he just treats Canada and the European Union like they are the enemies? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=316.24s)]
*  And again, Donald Trump continues to make the U.S. less and less relevant with this taco routine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a joke. It's a cloud. It's dangerous. And you see it's now impacting the economic data [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  we have here. But you know from watching the Midas Touch Network that the United States [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=334.8s)]
*  was basically sidelined during the NATO summit while Canada entered into a very strong defense [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  pact with the European Union, which also included very close economic coordination. So then you had [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=348.08s)]
*  this morning Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. We haven't seen him humiliate himself all that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=357.76s)]
*  recently on Fox, but he's back. We see him humiliate himself every day, but here he goes back on Fox. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  And Maria Bartiroma asks, so what is the next country we should expect a trade deal [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  with the United States? Who's going to do it? Are you going to get any deal done beyond just the UK [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=375.68s)]
*  before this August deadline? And by the way, note that she's now talking about an August deadline. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=383.04s)]
*  Wasn't the deadline 90 days, like July 9th? Okay, now it's an August deadline. It's Labor Day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=389.92s)]
*  These people are the most pathetic, worst negotiators, and they just lie about everything. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=395.92s)]
*  Remember 90 deals in 90 days? Remember everyone's going to get $5,000 Doge checks because Doge was [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=401.92s)]
*  going to be so great. Remember you were promised a $5,000 Doge check. Maybe we should file a class [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=408.56s)]
*  action against the Trump regime to give us those $5,000 Doge checks that they promised. And then [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  they said inflation would be down and there would be so many jobs. You wouldn't know what to do with [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=419.68s)]
*  it. Anyway, here's Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. What is the next country we should expect a trade [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=423.44s)]
*  deal to do with the United States? Are you going to be able to get some deal announcements beyond [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  just the UK before this August deadline? What we're going to hear from the the Court of International [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=434.4s)]
*  Appeals? Maria, you know, with all things that they get done at the end, you have to put on a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=439.92s)]
*  deadline. As you and I know, nothing gets done in Washington well in advance. So I think a lot of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=446.96s)]
*  the countries are feeling pressure. As President Trump has said, you know, he's created maximum [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  negotiating leverage for Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick, and myself by saying that if you can't [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=460.56s)]
*  get to a deal, he's happy to go back to the April 2nd level. So we have countries approaching us [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=466.4s)]
*  with very good deals. We have 18 important trading partners. UK, China, they are behind us for now, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=474.08s)]
*  are behind us. And then Secretary Lutnick said yesterday that he expects 10 more deals. So, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=485.76s)]
*  you know, if we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18, you know, there are another important 20 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  relationships, then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day. So, you know, we will [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=498.64s)]
*  have taxes and trade, which I think will provide great stimulus from the economy. And then there's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=505.84s)]
*  the deregulatory impact. By the way, I often get asked the research tools I use when I do videos [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=512.72s)]
*  like this. The big one for me that I use is ground news, which is an essential research tool for me. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=519.52s)]
*  Go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code and you can get 40% off the top tier vantage plan at ground [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=525.52s)]
*  news. That's what I use to do all of the research that I do. And one of the features I use for [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=535.36s)]
*  ground news is something called the blind spot. And I use blind spot to try to show me what's the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=540.24s)]
*  right covering, what's the left covering so I can determine, you know, does any specific thing need [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  more attention? So you learn, for example, when you use blind spot on the right wing, they're saying [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=551.84s)]
*  stories like this. One year later, the Biden Trump debate fallout coverage continues. Like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=557.2s)]
*  who's talking about Biden right now? Like, Biden did a great job. He's done. And MAGAs just want [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=563.6s)]
*  to blame everything on Biden. Or there's this story right here. Killing Fields. Israeli soldiers [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  ordered to shoot unarmed Palestinians in Gaza. Basically, no one on the right is covering that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=574.0s)]
*  and it's getting wide coverage on the left. And something like that should not be a partisan issue. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=580.08s)]
*  Okay, we should all be able to condemn killing unarmed people, children and mothers and what man [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  unarmed people in Gaza. I think that that we should all say that's that's not a good thing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=592.32s)]
*  And that needs to end. By the way, Trump promised that he would end that in 24 hours. Yet another [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump lie. Again, go to ground.news.mtn scan the QR code and get 40% off the research tools that I [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=602.0s)]
*  use. Ground News is subscriber funded. They don't rely on ads that can introduce bias. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=609.04s)]
*  Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the media [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  transparent. Thank you to ground news right there. I like how Justin Wolfers, the economist, puts it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=617.12s)]
*  We're now in summer reruns. Trump began his presidency by targeting Canada with tariffs, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=623.28s)]
*  settled the spat, and now he's recycling those threats. What hasn't changed is that he's really [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=628.64s)]
*  threatening to tax Americans who buy from Canada. Also, the Trump regime has demanded that Congress [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=634.0s)]
*  investigate Harvard, as Justin Wolfers points out. Harvard is free for anyone whose family income [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=642.48s)]
*  is below 100,000 and tuition free if it's below 200,000. So the Trump administration is investigating [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=648.08s)]
*  it for working to raise tuition prices while offering selective financial aid packages [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=654.48s)]
*  to maximize profits. In other words, if you are rich, you may have to pay more than people who are [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=660.16s)]
*  poor to get an education because education should be open to everyone. And the Trump regime takes [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=665.68s)]
*  issue with that. One of the things that Trump posted as well is he goes, giant win in the United [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=671.04s)]
*  States Supreme Court on the issue of nationwide injunctions. You may have heard about this ruling [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=677.52s)]
*  where the Supreme Court limited the ability to get nationwide injunctions in the birthright [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=682.64s)]
*  citizenship case. The Supreme Court did not say that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=687.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court said that individuals and nonprofit groups, anybody other than states, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=693.76s)]
*  can't seek nationwide injunctions unless you file a class action. So states can still get [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=700.16s)]
*  nationwide injunctions. And when it comes to the issue of birthright citizenship, the states are [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=706.48s)]
*  the parties in that case. So it actually doesn't impact the birthright citizenship case at all. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=711.6s)]
*  And then you can just file as a class action and amend the lawsuit. So it's actually not going to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  have the devastating impact that some people have suggested. It's still a bad ruling. But Trump goes [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=722.64s)]
*  giant win in the United States Supreme Court. Even the birthright citizenship hoax has been [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  indirectly hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves same year, not the scamming of our [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  immigration process. Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Solicitor General John Sauer [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=739.68s)]
*  and the entire DOJ. And again, it should be noted that during the Biden administration, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=745.76s)]
*  Trump and his supporters would always have these individual groups seek nationwide injunctions to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=751.76s)]
*  block Biden, not states like these individual groups, which they always supported then. And now [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=756.8s)]
*  they're trying to stop individual groups to do that now when Trump's in office. But as Norm Eisen [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=762.8s)]
*  points out what I said, this is a lie as usual. Well, I disagree with the decision. It leaves the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=767.36s)]
*  injunctions of the birthright executive order in place, just narrows them to the plaintiffs. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=772.56s)]
*  It doesn't limit nationwide class actions, which will be filed to achieve identical outcomes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=779.52s)]
*  The executive order remains unconstitutional. Here's a fact, by the way, that I think is not [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=785.1199999999999s)]
*  getting enough reporting and it needs to get more reporting. The US used a total of 20% [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=790.2399999999999s)]
*  of its total THAAD, THAAD Defense Missile Stockpile. That's it's basically air defense missile [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=796.48s)]
*  stockpile in 11 days, costing $800 million to defend Israel from Iranian missiles. So we spent [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  about $1 billion and used 20% of our missile stockpile to shoot down the ballistic missiles [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=812.56s)]
*  from Iran that taxpayers are paying for. Think about how that money could be used for nonprofits [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=821.44s)]
*  and how that money could be used for essential government services and for veterans. But anyway, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=829.6s)]
*  that's what it was used for right there. Two other data points I think is important to point out. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  They're trying to outmag a Trump in Florida. So some ridiculous things we've even seen today. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  Ron DeSantis went on Fox where they bragged about the concentration camps that he's building for [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=847.28s)]
*  migrants. Here's what Ron DeSantis said. Let's play it. So I mean, this is going to be illegals [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  will come in. They'll be processed. There'll be places for them to be housed. You'll have an [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  ability for food. You'll have the ability for them to consult legal rights if they have that, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=863.6s)]
*  because there is a process that's involved with this. So this is really everything. This is going [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=870.72s)]
*  to be a self-contained little area. And then of course, you also have stuff for the staff that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=874.72s)]
*  work here. So we've got laundry facilities. We've got showers. We've got obviously that you see the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=880.64s)]
*  shower and bath facilities. Yep. Right there. Yep. Where do you go to get a bunch of bathrooms [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=887.52s)]
*  like that? Well, we, so this is being done by the Division of Emergency Management. So when we- [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, you want to talk about the ultimate gaslighting. Here's MAGA Republican Congresswoman [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=899.36s)]
*  Kate Kamik. And she had a ectopic pregnancy recently. And she was saying that she cannot [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=904.08s)]
*  be treated because of the left and Democrats calling out the MAGA Republicans for limiting [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=912.08s)]
*  doctors to treat ectopic pregnancy. She goes, the doctors were so afraid to give me treatment [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=922.0s)]
*  because of the Democrats. Not because you were one of the people who passed the law to limit, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=927.76s)]
*  women's reproductive rights. Here, play this clip. Ectopic pregnancy is unviable. In my case, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=934.08s)]
*  I was five weeks pregnant. There was no heartbeat. And no ectopic pregnancy is viable. And that's so [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=940.0s)]
*  important because the mother needs care immediately. But unfortunately, women's healthcare has been [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=945.04s)]
*  subject to the worst politic fear-mongering that you can experience. And so they had actually been [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=951.36s)]
*  receiving these healthcare providers, had been receiving pro-abortion lobby ads to the tune of [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=960.48s)]
*  millions of dollars being spent on these ads that were threatening and scaring doctors away from [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=967.6s)]
*  helping women saying that they could lose their license, they could go to jail. In fact, in the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  room, I had nurses and doctors showing me these advertisements saying that they felt uncomfortable [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=978.0s)]
*  because they didn't want to go to jail. They wanted to help me, but they couldn't, they felt [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=983.44s)]
*  like they couldn't do anything. So I literally was laying on the table reading them the law. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=987.44s)]
*  And it dawned on me as I was sitting there with my husband, this is what women are experiencing [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  because of the fear-mongering around women's healthcare. And it has to stop. The left [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=997.36s)]
*  absolutely played a role in making sure that doctors and women were scared to seek out the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=1002.6400000000001s)]
*  help that they needed. And so I think that this is a wake-up call. My story should really [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  bring forward the national conversation that's long overdue about the lack of maternal healthcare. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=1014.64s)]
*  And really, I think it's important that we highlight that doctors aren't to blame, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  women aren't to blame. We need to get the politics out of women's healthcare. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyOIpLD518&t=1025.52s)]
