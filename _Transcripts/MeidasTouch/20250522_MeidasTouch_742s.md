# GOP Gets SHOCKED as Dems KEEP FLIPPING Districts
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E)
*  The midterms are getting closer than we think and I think we have to really talk about how Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=0.0s)]
*  plan on flipping red congressional seats blue, how they plan on flipping red states and turning [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=6.48s)]
*  them blue, and we have to look at what's working across the country and we do see things that are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=14.4s)]
*  working and so I think it's important we highlight people who are in these frontline districts who [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=19.92s)]
*  are winning. I want to remind Avery about our reporting last week about the mayoral election [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=25.44s)]
*  in Omaha, Nebraska where a Democrat, John Ewing Jr. defeated the longest serving Republican mayor [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=31.28s)]
*  incumbent in the United States and it was a 20-point shift from the prior election [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=40.8s)]
*  held in 2021. So a 20-point shift where a Republican who had held that seat for 12 years, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=49.04s)]
*  that mayoral seat for 12 years lost. I want to remind you of what John Ewing Jr. said when he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=56.64s)]
*  won here. Let's play this clip quickly. Tonight we embark on a new chapter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  I am deeply honored and humbled to stand before you today as your mayor-elect. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=78.88s)]
*  You know one of the things in that election that I think was important is that the Republican [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=91.84s)]
*  candidate went full MAGA and was talking about all these culture war issues and bathrooms and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=97.44s)]
*  just all of these things and John Ewing Jr. was talking about potholes and medicine and health [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=104.16s)]
*  care and things that really mattered to his constituents. There was a debate over this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=111.44s)]
*  horrible budget bill that the MAGA Republicans are trying to ram through and this is a portion [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=118.32s)]
*  that kind of brings it home where there was a Congresswoman Fernandez wanted one of these MAGA [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=124.16s)]
*  Republican Congress members, Adam Smith, to just read the legislation they were pushing through at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=129.2s)]
*  1 a.m. and they were sneaking in all of these provisions like a way to do tax deductions or [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=134.48s)]
*  exemptions for tanning beds because you know they're all tanning themselves you know orange [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  over there while taking away hospital beds. This is an important moment that I think really resonates [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  with voters. Let's play this clip. So that the American public knows what this bill does. One [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=153.44s)]
*  of the little things that it does, would you please read page 901 line 20? I think it'd be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=158.96s)]
*  better if you read it. Oh he doesn't want to read it. I'll read it. I know the legislation but I'm not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=164.88s)]
*  going to be part of your little show here so you can read it. It was a question if you would read [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=171.84s)]
*  it so I'll ask ranking member Moore to read the text. This is in their bill. They don't want to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=177.68s)]
*  read a line from their own bill. Banking member. I don't want to read the bill for you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=184.48s)]
*  I am testifying about this legislation. I'm not going to read the bill to you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay I am. This is amazing. Ms. Lager-Fernandez, shall I pass this back or shall I read it for you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Action 111106, repeal of excise tax on indoor tanning services. So they're going to repeal, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=205.76s)]
*  they're repealing an excise tax on tanning beds. Okay so if you have a tanning bed, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=216.56s)]
*  you get a little bit of a tax break and if you need a hospital bed in rural America, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=225.04s)]
*  I'm sorry you're out of luck. Right and I don't know where this particular provision came from. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=230.96s)]
*  We do know that there are certain elected officials who appear to have a certain orange [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=238.0s)]
*  hue about them. That maybe they want to make sure that tanning beds get a little bit of special [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  credit but really, really we are prioritizing tanning beds over hospital beds in rural America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=250.32s)]
*  So then we look to Oregon's fifth congressional district for I think one of the best roadmaps of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=259.6s)]
*  how Democrats can flip seats. There you had Lori Chavez-Dreamer, a MAGA Republican who's now the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  Labor Secretary who actually hates labor. She's been a fraud her entire life but she pretended [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=276.24s)]
*  that she was for labor. You had the now Democratic Congresswoman Janelle Bynum who is now a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=281.68s)]
*  Republican who had ran against her before but was really able to effectively point out in this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=288.88s)]
*  past election that Lori Chavez-Dreamer did not care about the constituents and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=294.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Bynum's always focused on hospital beds, health care, Medicaid, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=301.68s)]
*  focusing on issues that people really talk about and she won, Lori Chavez-Dreamer lost, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=307.92s)]
*  Dreamer then became the Labor Secretary and then said that admitted that she was against the pro act [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=313.12s)]
*  against the major thing for labor. So I want to bring in Democratic Congresswoman Bynum to again [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  talk us through, we've had Congresswoman Bynum on before but take a few months back. What are you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=325.92s)]
*  seeing now across the country? We're doing this interview late May-ish. What do you see in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman? Well we're seeing Democrats take the fight. I'm doing it both on the East Coast and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=340.08s)]
*  the West Coast. So in DC we're making sure we're standing up for Oregonians and Americans, making [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=346.24s)]
*  sure we're protesting at the in the well, making sure that we're bringing these issues of Medicaid, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=353.44s)]
*  of pharmacies and drugs and making sure that we're talking about how we center children in our policy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=360.64s)]
*  I'm someone that believes that Oregonians have told me they want to make sure they have the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=369.12s)]
*  healthiest children, they have the brightest future, that we're taking care of our seniors. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=374.0s)]
*  I'm doing this on the East Coast and the West Coast. We've launched our Give Them Hell Tour, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=378.64s)]
*  10 stops all throughout the summer. We've already started and people are giving us the material [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=385.04s)]
*  to take back to DC. You know what I love about your approach to politics is that I don't really [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=392.16s)]
*  view it that much as politics. I view it as people and you highlight the stories of people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=399.76s)]
*  in your district and across the country who are the victims, who are the targets of this MAGA [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=407.28s)]
*  cruelty like Rose, a first grader who you highlighted recently. Let's play this clip. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=414.4s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, this is Rose. She's seven years old in the first grade [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=419.84s)]
*  and she makes friends everywhere she goes. Rose was diagnosed with an ultra rare genetic syndrome [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  when she was just three and a half and now uses a feeding tube and a wheelchair. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  Medicaid allows Rose to receive physical therapy and thanks to this therapy she's starting to take [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=439.12s)]
*  steps. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues are working overtime to take [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=445.28s)]
*  Rose's health care away. It might be easy for people to strike through one number and write in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  another, take a little bit from here and there, but each of those numbers represents a person, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  a child like Rose who will lose critical care so billionaires can have more money in their pockets. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  We cannot let them steal from our kids and our families. We will not. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=470.64s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I yield back. And so Congresswoman, when we talk about, you know, 1 a.m. and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  tanning beds over Medicaid, we're talking about Rose, aren't we? Yeah, you know, they're sacrificing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=486.96s)]
*  Rose and millions of roses for a trash budget that lines the pockets of billionaires. And oh, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=493.28s)]
*  by the way, doesn't even lower the deficit. Trash, garbage in, garbage out, doesn't even protect [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  our children. And I just can't understand it. There's also some sort of disconnect. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=512.9599999999999s)]
*  Five thousand dollars if you have a kid without without even thinking about what it takes to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=519.84s)]
*  support our children, making sure that every child in this country has a full belly when they get to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  school, making sure that our seniors are cared for when they need medical care. It's there at a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=534.48s)]
*  rural hospital, making sure that our parents can care for their children, that they have good, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  stable jobs and that they're not going to have the wool ripped out from underneath them. Like, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=546.88s)]
*  that is the essence of what we're fighting here. Trump and his cronies are going to go down hard [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=552.96s)]
*  in the midterms. Guarantee. You know, your district is a purple district in Oregon. I mean, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=560.16s)]
*  it was held by a Republican for many years. So you just too. We made sure of that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=567.84s)]
*  But you but but that means that people for those years went into the ballot box, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  they saw a D and an R and for whatever reason they they click the R one for those years. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=581.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, no more. No more. But there are people who what are you hearing from those people [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=588.4s)]
*  though right now who went in that direction? Republican, ostensibly Republican voters, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  purple voters? Well, here's here's what people are telling me. Number one, they care about getting [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=600.64s)]
*  their Social Security benefits on time. And that wasn't a red issue or blue issue. That was just a [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=607.12s)]
*  green issue. They want to make sure that they can count on their government to deliver what it's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=613.36s)]
*  supposed to what it's supposed to and when it's supposed to. The issue with, you know, having the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=618.56s)]
*  Republican candidate in this race was that she was lying to Oregonians about what her beliefs are [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=624.88s)]
*  and what she was going to defend. And we illuminated the fact that she wasn't really pro labor. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=633.12s)]
*  She got to her nomination seat and started saying, Oh, no, I don't remember that. And that to me, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=639.76s)]
*  that to me is the warning for Americans in the midterms that these people will lie, say that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=646.56s)]
*  they're on your team. And then when the rubber meets the road, they can't remember. That's the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=653.6s)]
*  problem. Wolf and sheep's clothing, trying to make you think that you're going to get x packaging, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=660.24s)]
*  you get y. And that's why this trash budget is so dangerous. That's why they're trying to do it in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=665.28s)]
*  the middle of the night. That's why they're trying to rush it through in just a couple of days and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=670.96s)]
*  hold everybody's time in their district hostage. That is why you attempt to push a trash budget [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=675.52s)]
*  through because you know it's trash. It always started out as trash, always will be trash and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=681.68s)]
*  will forever continue to be in history trash. Congresswoman Bynum, thanks as always for joining [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=687.52s)]
*  us. We're going to be following the tour. Where are the next stops? Oh, we're going to Albany, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=694.2399999999999s)]
*  Lake Oswego. We're going to Bend. We're going all over the district. All right. We'll have [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXkdj7RO7E&t=698.56s)]
