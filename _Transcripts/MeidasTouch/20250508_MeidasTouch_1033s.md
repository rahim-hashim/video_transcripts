# Fox News LOSES CONTROL on LIVE TV as Trump GETS WORSE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA)
*  You know, for this administration right now to blame the former administration, I'm sorry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=0.0s)]
*  When it's happening on your watch, and if this were a Democrat, I'd say the same thing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=5.04s)]
*  When it's happening on your watch, you are responsible. The buck stops with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=8.64s)]
*  Stop deflecting blame. Show some solutions, specific solutions so that we can all be safe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=13.68s)]
*  That was a host on state regime media known as Fox right there, calling out the current regime [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=19.28s)]
*  for its dangerous, dangerous handling of the FAA and across its agencies. That's on Fox. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=26.96s)]
*  But of course, you then have other hosts on state regime media known as Fox, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=35.28s)]
*  like Jesse Waters saying, look, the United States just needs to steal land. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  That's what we do in the United States. Let's steal Greenland. Let's take land, manifest destiny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=44.72s)]
*  We need conquest. This is pathetic, vile host from Fox. Jesse Waters played this clip right here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=50.88s)]
*  And he's also talking about, he doesn't like Trump talking about expanding. The United States [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=57.68s)]
*  has always expanded either by force or we buy things. We bought Alaska from the Russians. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=61.6s)]
*  We bought half the country from the French. We beat the Mexicans, the Native Americans, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  the Spanish, the British. That's how we do things here. It's manifest destiny. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=72.16s)]
*  And if we find out that we need Greenland as a matter of national survival, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=76.4s)]
*  of course, any president, Republican or Democrat, should get it by any means necessary. And it looks [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=81.36s)]
*  like right now we have our intelligence agencies in Greenland on the ground right now, ensuring [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  that they vote for independence. That's right. You know, when you say things like that, Jesse, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  I know you think that that's, you know, funny or that's entertainment or anger taming or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  rage baiting for your audience. What you mean by that is you want to send young men and women to die [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  in wars against our allies. So shut up because you have no clue what you're talking about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=106.16s)]
*  You have no clue what sacrifices and you live in your $20 million homes and behave the way you do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=112.72s)]
*  like a reckless maniac while you cause harm to the American people, you and other state regime media [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=119.12s)]
*  hosts. Here's Will Kane, who's trying to be like Jesse Waters and Jesse Waters trying to be like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson with mega Republican Congress member Annapalina Lunon. And here they're talking [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=131.12s)]
*  about they got to go after Dr. Fauci. That's how they spend their day. Go after Fauci. Here, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  play this clip. And that's what I want to lean in on for a moment, Congresswoman, because I think [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=142.56s)]
*  at this point, everybody watching knows that Dr. Fauci lied. At a minimum, he played semantics over [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  the definition of gain of function, but that it amounted to a lie. Let's set aside the pardon for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  just one moment. I don't know if the pardon covers any potential accountability for perjury, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=157.12s)]
*  but would you like to see, and I think everyone watching finally wants to hear about some form [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  of accountability. Would you like to see something done here by attorney general Pam Bondi? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=166.32s)]
*  Yes. And what I will tell you is to give assurance, because I know people are tired of members of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=172.96s)]
*  Congress sending strongly worded letters. I'm also very tired of that. I want to see action. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I will look at doing a criminal referral for those statements. I will go on record for that and I [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=181.6s)]
*  will do it as soon as I get back to my office. But what I also want to say is the attorney general [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=186.24s)]
*  has the ability to put some teeth behind what we're trying to do in Congress. Remember Congress is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  not a punitive arm, although we reserve the right for inherent contempt, having the department of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=195.68s)]
*  justice for referrals, they need to really follow up. As you know, I also referred some of these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=199.84s)]
*  sanctuary city mayors. So I do believe what he did was wrong. I do believe that he needs to be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  brought to justice and I will happily authorize a criminal referral. And I will also be asking [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=207.84s)]
*  Chairman Comer to help authorize that as well. Next up, I will show you Kevin Hassett right here, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=212.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's national economic advisor on Laura Ingraham play this clip. Well, the scare monitoring [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=218.56s)]
*  is happening now, but I can tell you that I get real time data every day on whether there are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=224.32s)]
*  shortages and I can report that there are still plenty of things on the shelves. There were a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=228.32s)]
*  couple of weeks where shipping from China was lower, but now shipping from a lot of other countries [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=233.6s)]
*  is going way, way up. So people don't have to be worried about what the scare mongers are saying. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=238.0s)]
*  These policies are on-shoring jobs, on-shoring production. You can see it in the jobs data. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=242.56s)]
*  You can see it in the explosion in manufacturing jobs already, even before the tariffs came in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=246.96s)]
*  The way to think about it for me, Laura, is that President Trump did something last time, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=251.44s)]
*  looked and saw that it really worked, and now he's doing more of it a little bit bigger. But [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=255.68s)]
*  that's what you should do. You should do something, see if it works or not, and then change. And that's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=259.68s)]
*  what he's doing. He's ramping up the ante because he saw that it worked in the past. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=263.36s)]
*  And here they are bragging about how the federal government is unlawfully taking away $2.2 billion [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=268.64s)]
*  from Harvard, and they're celebrating this like it's a good thing. Yeah, celebrate the fact that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=277.6s)]
*  you're gutting America's top university, and now our top professors and scientists are being [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=282.56s)]
*  recruited by Europe, by China, and by other nations. You freaking moron, state regime media. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=289.36s)]
*  Great to celebrate this as now brain drain is taking a hold, and the brand of America has been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=296.72s)]
*  damaged by morons like you. Here, play this clip right here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=302.8s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=308.32s)]
*  Big news for the Crimson, as in the Harvard Crimson. You know, Harvard University's motto [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=312.0s)]
*  is veritas, truth. And the truth is tonight, Harvard just lost $2.2 billion with a B, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=318.56s)]
*  federal dollars. You ever look back at the wallet that you used to carry and cringe? Well, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=327.04s)]
*  mine was like this giant crusty leather brick that barely fit in my pocket. And don't even [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  get me started on the back pain from sitting on even. Then I found Ridge, and I'm obsessed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=337.44s)]
*  Their wallets are slim, modern, and uniquely designed to hold up to 12 cards plus cash [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  without the bulk. Made from premium materials like aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=350.0s)]
*  this thing is built like a tank, but sleek. There are over 50 colors and styles to choose from. So, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=355.76s)]
*  you can actually show off your wallet instead of hiding it. And yeah, it gives me serious peace [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  of mind knowing that every Ridge wallet has RFID blocking tech to keep digital pickpocketers out of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  my business, plus a lifetime warranty. This is literally the last wallet you'll ever have to buy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=373.52s)]
*  For a limited time, our listeners get 10% off at Ridge by using code MIDAS at checkout. Just head [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=379.52s)]
*  to ridge.com and use code MIDAS and you're all set. After your purchase, they'll ask you where [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=385.76s)]
*  you heard about them. Please support our show and tell them that MIDAS Touch sent you. Thank you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=392.08s)]
*  I do want to show this other moment though, when Fox was covering the congressional hearings that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  was taking place and they pointed out a moment where these MAGA Republicans were trying to make [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=402.24s)]
*  it seem like the head of the United States Fencing Association was giving the middle finger to like a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=408.72s)]
*  selfie photo. But then as a Democratic congresswoman pointed out, Marjorie Taylor Green and the MAGA's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=417.44s)]
*  manipulated the photo. He had two fingers up and they cut off one finger to make it look like he [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=423.52s)]
*  was giving the middle fingers. Play this clip, but then I'll explain to you, Ben, what are you [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=428.24s)]
*  fencing? What are you talking about here? Play this clip. I had already spent the money on competition [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=432.24s)]
*  fees and new equipment and spent hours training. I felt trapped. I had been defrauded of a women's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=436.72s)]
*  tournament and sold a lie by USA Fencing. Now one big fight, Martha, has been over a picture of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=442.88s)]
*  chairman. Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Green actually brought it up during the hearing and Democrats [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  said this was a big misrepresentation. Watch this. Mr. LaFelt came in here today saying that this is [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  game day. You're right, Mr. LaFelt. This is game day. The document that you have up behind you is a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=464.4s)]
*  misrepresentation of the actual post. It appears that you're trying to misrepresent a witness here [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  who you use subpoena powers. Yes, folks, fencing. Why fencing? I'll do a whole other video on this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=476.64s)]
*  today, but the MAGA Republicans did a hearing for their DOGE, government efficiency, whatever the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=484.08s)]
*  hell they're talking about, which by the way is going to cost trillions of dollars, add trillions [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  of dollars to our deficit and has saved nothing. It's stolen your data, by the way. But the DOGE [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=495.2s)]
*  hearing led by Marjorie Taylor Green, they had the head of USA Fencing because they wanted to talk [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=499.76s)]
*  about how there was a trans fencer, transgender fencer, and that that was offensive to them. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  Even though the Fencing USA gets no money from the federal government. Anyway, I'll do another video [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=512.16s)]
*  on that. Laura Ingraham then asked Kevin Hassett, Trump's national economic advisor, about firing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=518.32s)]
*  Jerome Powell. Play this clip. For heart of hearts, do you believe that Jay Powell is acting more [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=525.12s)]
*  politically than economically in his comments? I won't comment directly on Jay Powell, but I do [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=531.44s)]
*  know that there is a committee at the Fed right now that's been appointed mostly by Biden people [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=539.44s)]
*  and they have a worldview that's inconsistent with the facts of the previous term. Don't forget when [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=544.72s)]
*  we had the tax cuts and jobs act that created the explosion in wages, the reduction in income [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=550.24s)]
*  inequality, the massive explosion in jobs all the time. This is going to be inflationary. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=554.72s)]
*  By the way, this guy, Kevin Hassett is an idiot. He's wrong about everything. This is the guy right [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=561.6s)]
*  before the dot com bubble bursted in 2000. He's like, it's about to soar and it bombed. This guy's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=566.24s)]
*  wrong about literally everything. I think it was he and Peter Navarro. Remember they guaranteed, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=573.76s)]
*  remember they said, we guarantee you quarter one will not have any contraction at all. We will grow. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=579.6s)]
*  There will not be negative GDP. Well, they're just wrong about everything and they just move on to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=585.44s)]
*  the next lie. Here's Kevin Hassett again attacking the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=589.92s)]
*  play this clip. Well, first we respect the independence of the Fed, but I don't always agree [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=596.16s)]
*  with Chairman Jay Powell on policy. And I still, as I said before, in the last few weeks after the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=602.56s)]
*  president talks about the Fed again, that I'm dismayed that they've got bad economic modeling [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=608.4s)]
*  of what might happen to tariffs. They said, you know, if you look at the Wall Street folks, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=614.16s)]
*  they're saying that the tariffs are going to crater the economy. Meanwhile, we got really [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=617.84s)]
*  strong jobs and we don't have the inflation that they said was going to happen. And so to have the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=621.2s)]
*  Fed out there job boning against the president's policies, I, you know, they didn't do that when [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=626.0s)]
*  Joe Biden was printing money and spending it and creating 20% inflation. And so it just makes me [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=631.2s)]
*  wonder about like what's wrong with their models or what's wrong with their politics. Then on [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  Hannity, you had Josh Hawley talk about, you know, these people live on different planets. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=640.96s)]
*  They're from different, different Mars. I was talking about play this clip. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=647.84s)]
*  These people live on a different planet, Sean. They're totally out of touch with reality. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=651.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is turning the country around in a hundred short days. And that's why they're [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=655.92s)]
*  desperate. The Democrats are totally desperate. They're jetting around now to foreign countries [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=659.68s)]
*  to hold hands with terrorists. Here he is blaming the current rising inflation and former president [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=664.4s)]
*  Biden. Let's play it. It's hilarious. Is that Joe Biden and Buttigieg and all the rest, they now act [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=670.0s)]
*  like they have no idea how the country got into this state. I mean, my gosh, inflation is really [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=674.8s)]
*  high. Gee, how did that happen? Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because Joe Biden shut down [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=678.8s)]
*  American energy production, spent three, four trillion dollars on green new deal giveaways. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  And may I just contrast that to some normalcy here as well? Like Minnesota governor walls was on MSNBC [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  last night. And here's what he said. Let's play the clip. He, you know, he told you he would end [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. He would bring prices down eggs and now telling people when did government [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  get to tell you how many dolls your child has? I mean, this was my whole point about this, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=706.24s)]
*  you know, government just big enough to fit in your bedroom, your womb, and apparently now in [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=710.8s)]
*  your toy chest. That is it's insane. It's a command economy with him dictating. It is no free market [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=714.48s)]
*  principles. My farmers have worked years to cultivate markets in a free market around the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  world. And we have thrived at that. We feed the world. We clothe the world. We power the world. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=725.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is now deciding that he gets to do all of that. And the real thing is, is to enrich [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=730.32s)]
*  the industries he chooses. He's picking the winners and losers. And in this case, the billionaires [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=735.2s)]
*  are winning. The rest of us are losing. Here he is again, play the clip. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  I, you know, I don't know this for my amateur psychologist. I think he listened to one class [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=745.6s)]
*  when he was back in the eighties or something at Wharton in his six months there or whatever. And [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=750.24s)]
*  he misreads this. It's a ludicrous philosophy. No one agrees with him. And then they come back to, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=754.88s)]
*  well, Democrats put tariffs on. Yes, they're a tool. They're a scalpel. You can use them when [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=760.08s)]
*  you have unfair practices. But he's talking about the thing that drives me insane with working with [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=764.0s)]
*  Canada and Mexico. He's the guy who negotiated the deal. And then he turns around and says, well, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=770.32s)]
*  we don't care much about Canada. I was glad to see the, you know, the prime minister coming in [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=776.08s)]
*  of saying from Canada of saying, are you out of your mind? What would your biggest trading partner? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=781.6s)]
*  They are our biggest trading partner in Minnesota. There are dearest friends there. They're who we [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=786.48s)]
*  care about. He has no concept. This goes back to that idea. So many Americans thought, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=791.04s)]
*  we need to hire a businessman to run government like business. Two things about that are wrong. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=795.92s)]
*  No, we don't need to run government like a business because we're not in the profit making. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=801.12s)]
*  We're in the proving lives and looking towards the future. And this guy has a proven track record of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  being an absolute failure. And I think the opening for Democrats is, is to work with the business [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  community. My, I am home to many large fortune 500 companies that are put at risk by this. And [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=816.96s)]
*  I'll just say this, I'm calling these folks out. They need to stand up. He threatens them. He [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=823.6s)]
*  threatens, you know, universities, thank goodness, Harvard standing up to them. But that's how he [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  gets things done. He doesn't get it done through competency. He doesn't get it done through results. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=834.48s)]
*  He gets it done through fear, intimidation. And I'm with you. I wish he could have been weirdly [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  obsessed with like pickleball or something rather than tariffs. That's where he could spend his time, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=844.88s)]
*  but it's on this tariff thing that doesn't work. And here's democratic congresswoman, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=849.2s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. Let's play it. They also were supposed to have a markup as relates to agriculture [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=853.6s)]
*  and snap benefits, cutting $220 billion from snap when people only get $6 a day to eat in snap [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=859.36s)]
*  benefits for those that do receive it. And the last time I checked, you probably can't get 12 eggs [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=865.92s)]
*  for that amount of money. And so instead of doing it, literally there was a leak in a story that came [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=870.48s)]
*  out where staffer said, no, we want to make sure we can flood the zone. So whenever we do this, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  we're going to make sure that these committees are going to be at the same time. Like the fact that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=880.96s)]
*  you're hiding from your constituents, the fact that you literally just are like, let me just throw [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=885.6s)]
*  everything at you so that we can overwhelm you instead of actually doing your job. I cannot wait [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=890.48s)]
*  until voters have an opportunity to say, you took food out of my mouth. You took a roof from over [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=897.04s)]
*  my head. You're responsible for making sure that I do not have healthcare. I'm going to make sure [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=902.56s)]
*  you don't have a job. Do you see the contrast there folks? Do you see, Oh, let me show you the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  full clip of that Fox host, by the way, who I showed you at the beginning. Let's play it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=913.92s)]
*  They say what happened in Newark, we are seeing an increase in problems. And there weren't these [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  problems in the past four years. Since January, there have been five significant crashes that [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=922.72s)]
*  hasn't been since 2009. So if everything happened in the last four years and nothing happened during [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  the last four years, I'm not buying it. Additionally, because it comes down to two things, staffing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  and equipment. And specifically, they say in Newark, it comes down to one copper wire. Pete [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  Buttigieg specifically wanted the 50 airports in the United States that need to have fiber, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=943.84s)]
*  that need to have internet and not copper. And he wanted those changed. People seem to think that, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=951.36s)]
*  you know, anybody who is in charge of the FAA, can just even the president can just, you know, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=957.04s)]
*  write a check and hand it off. No, they can't. We have something called Congress. Those funds have [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=962.32s)]
*  to be approved with and from legislation that has to go through there. So, you know, for this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=966.0s)]
*  administration right now to blame the former administration, I'm sorry, when it's happening [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  on your watch. And if this were a Democrat, I'd say the same thing. When it's happening on your [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=976.88s)]
*  watch, you are responsible. The buck stops with you. Stop deflecting blame, show some solutions, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=980.96s)]
*  specific solutions so that we can all be safe. I flew into JFK last night, three and a half hour [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=987.6s)]
*  delay, but I am here. Thanks, Obama. You said so the five crashes being the worst. What did you mean [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  by that? Since January, there have been five significant incidents. And that's the worst, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  you said? Since 2009. Yes. I would like a check on that. There you have it. Let me know what you [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9KLWDhnkjA&t=1003.76s)]
