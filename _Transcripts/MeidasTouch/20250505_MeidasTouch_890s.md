# Marjorie Taylor Greene TURNS AGAINST Trump IN PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o)
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene's been on a tear, expressing a great deal of displeasure and anger about things that Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans have done recently. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=0.0s)]
*  She is pissed that Donald Trump entered into a minerals deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Notice that this minerals deal was being talked about before all of the time, but now nobody's talking about this minerals deal at all. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=18.7s)]
*  Because President Zelensky of Ukraine totally outmaneuvered Donald Trump and the things that Donald Trump was trying to shake down Zelensky with. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=26.9s)]
*  Ultimately, Donald Trump didn't get in Zelensky worked out a great deal for Zelensky and frankly for the free world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=36.5s)]
*  But you notice that MAGA is not talking about that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=44.4s)]
*  Well, Marjorie Taylor Greene's pissed about that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=46.9s)]
*  She's pissed at the other MAGA Republicans in the House. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=49.3s)]
*  And there's a civil war brewing within the MAGA Republican ranks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=52.7s)]
*  Let me just show you what's going on here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=56.4s)]
*  And then I want to also talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene's market manipulation and what her stock trades are showing in my opinion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=58.5s)]
*  Here's what Marjorie Taylor Greene just posted. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=67.5s)]
*  We don't want the rare earth minerals in Ukraine that will bind America to never ending spending and military defense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=69.6s)]
*  We have plenty of our own rare earth minerals we can mine right here at home creating American jobs and wealth. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  But the federal government needs to allow it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  Not sure she really has an understanding of anything yet alone the way rare earth minerals work. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=90.1s)]
*  Also, it's probably not a good idea to attack Canada and Donald Trump continuing to use war language against Canada when there is a huge amount of rare earth minerals in Canada. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=96.4s)]
*  Also, we should reflect upon the fact that Canada has placed a total embargo on rare earth minerals in its possession reaching the United States, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=107.8s)]
*  which is critical for components and most of our electronics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=116.6s)]
*  That's not getting a lot of attention except here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene then post the following. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=124.1s)]
*  I represent the base and when I'm frustrated and upset over the direction of things, you better be clear. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=126.6s)]
*  The base is not happy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=133.5s)]
*  I campaign for no more foreign wars and now we're supposedly on the verge of going to war with Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=135.4s)]
*  I don't think we should be bombing foreign countries on behalf of other foreign countries, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=141.0s)]
*  especially when they have their own nuclear weapons and massive military strength. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  And on top of that, now we're told that we have signed a deal for mineral rights in Ukraine in order to pay us back for the hundreds of billions of dollars that we gave Ukraine [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=148.3s)]
*  and they used for money laundering sold the weapons we gave them to our enemies and their leader is a dictator who canceled elections was involved. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  Of the first impeachment of Trump and campaign for Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=165.2s)]
*  Plus even when I'm sharing with you Marjorie Taylor Greene turning against the GOP and attacking the GOP and without saying Trump's name also attacking Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=168.6s)]
*  I got a fact checker because all of these things are absolutely false. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=178.7s)]
*  The money is not being used for money laundering. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=182.7s)]
*  It's been used to defend Ukraine, which stands as a bulwark on the front lines of protecting the free world from Russia invading other areas in Eastern Europe [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  and then taking Europe Ukraine has bravely defended itself and by by proxy has defended the entire free world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=194.7s)]
*  They're not selling enemies weapons to our enemies unless Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks that our enemies include NATO. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=203.5s)]
*  President Zelensky is not a dictator Vladimir Putin and your dear leader Marjorie Taylor Greene Donald Trump is and then she goes on to whine even more. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=211.1s)]
*  She goes didn't we learn our lesson when we went to war in Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein because of weapons of mass destruction? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Did we ever find any and did any of that oil over in the Middle East make us rich? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  The answer is no, we are 36 trillion dollars in debt today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=230.5s)]
*  Pause Donald Trump contributed to 25 percent of that Marjorie you and the MAGAs are responsible for most of that debt, but I'll go on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=233.5s)]
*  So why on earth would we go over and occupy Ukraine and spend an untold amount of future taxpayer dollars defending and mining their minerals as well as potentially putting American lives at risk at war? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=243.7s)]
*  Why don't we just mine our own rare earth minerals that are tied up on federal lands that the government confiscated years ago? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=254.0s)]
*  I also campaigned on accountability for the communist and tyrannical acts made by the government during covid yet the covid vaccine still has FDA approval. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=260.8s)]
*  Even though there were millions reported injuries and deaths in this mRNA vaccine is known to have a horrific side effects and does not stop people from catching covid. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=270.3s)]
*  Let's pause there for a second again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=279.1s)]
*  Even though this video showing you Marjorie Taylor Greene attacking other MAGA Republicans, I have to fact check it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=281.8s)]
*  The covid vaccine is effective. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=288.2s)]
*  We've seen that in cohorts where the vaccines been used versus cohorts where it hasn't been used. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=290.7s)]
*  It has massively massively helped people and in unvaccinated communities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=297.6s)]
*  The rate of deaths and serious issues is at multiples of multiples of multiples. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=303.3s)]
*  The vaccine does work. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=309.3s)]
*  She goes on to talk about how she wants to revoke the FDA's approval. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  They spread all of these lies about the vaccine over and over again. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=316.3s)]
*  And here we are April. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=319.5s)]
*  I mean a May 5th and she's still doing the same thing, you know whining about this stuff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=321.3s)]
*  Then she goes on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=326.7s)]
*  I also campaign on accountability of the lawfare that was waged against the American people the past four years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=327.7s)]
*  What about all the people that were locked up in jail and the abuse they went through and when are those vicious attorneys and judges ever going to be held accountable for the lives they ruin pause there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=334.0s)]
*  Hey Marjorie Taylor Greene you are out there calling the despicable and disgusting human beings who invaded the Capitol the insurrectionist the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=345.5s)]
*  I know you call them heroes, but Donald Trump released them and he pardoned them or commuted their sentences. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=355.5s)]
*  They're out these dangerous horrific humans are out there running free, but that's not enough. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=363.4s)]
*  You want to throw in jail the Trump appointed judges and the Reagan appointed judges and don't get me wrong. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=369.7s)]
*  There are Biden appointed judges and Obama appointed judges as George W Bush appointed judges. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=376.2s)]
*  A lot of those judges in DC who warned Donald Trump not to pardon the January 6 terrorists who were involved in some of the most horrific act the violent offenders were Trump appointed judges or Trump appointed judges, but go on and she goes and I campaigned for an end to waste fraud and abuse of the American people's harder tax dollars harder tax dollars. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=382.2s)]
*  You may want to spell check this Marjorie, but okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=403.7s)]
*  I believe the Doge mission is one of the most important things happening today in our government and yet where are the rescission that we should be voting on in Congress. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  You lead the Doge committee Marjorie you had it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=416.70000000000005s)]

*  On the committee and ask questions. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=423.6s)]
*  I've never heard of somebody ever leading an initiative in our government who's too afraid to go before Congress and answer questions, but Elon Musk is being protected. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=426.0s)]
*  I thought you said he's so smart let him testify then she goes on and says and one of the biggest issues in the nation that I fought for and early on. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZKvdJE3-o&t=435.5s)]
