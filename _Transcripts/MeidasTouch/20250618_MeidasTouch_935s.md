# Trump has DISASTER Presser on WH Lawn on LIVE TV
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU)
*  A disaster on the White House lawn. Donald Trump just had one of the most humiliating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=0.0s)]
*  press conferences I've seen. I guess the purpose of this press conference, Donald Trump is putting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=4.72s)]
*  gigantic flagpoles on the North and South lawn of the White House. So he put a bunch of construction [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=11.28s)]
*  workers as props behind him, and then he turns around to the construction workers and he says, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=18.32s)]
*  Are any of you illegal? Any illegal immigrants here? Watch this, play this clip. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=24.72s)]
*  He says, so and so, this one is from you know where. Don't worry, I think you're going to be [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=54.72s)]
*  okay. I'll be right behind you. Far behind you. I'll be right behind you. So he then starts taking [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=60.72s)]
*  questions. A CNN reporter asks him about how his warmongering in the Middle East could be unpopular, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=68.32s)]
*  and then he starts attacking the CNN reporter. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=76.72s)]
*  On the US response to CNN. Fake news, fortunately nobody watches. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=84.88s)]
*  Is anybody watching CNN nowadays? I haven't seen it in a long time. Some of your supporters are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=93.44s)]
*  wary of the US getting involved in another foreign mall, and some believe that we should support. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=100.0s)]
*  Do you ever ask a positive question at CNN? My supporters are more in love with me today, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=106.08s)]
*  and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=111.2s)]
*  Then Donald Trump starts attacking the chairman of the Federal Reserve, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Jerome Powell. He calls him a stupid person. I want you to watch the person all the way on the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=118.72s)]
*  right, the construction worker, who's like, what the hell is this guy even saying? Here, play this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=125.52s)]
*  clip. You know what it is, but I shouldn't use it in front of the fake news. So it's very sad to see [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=130.24s)]
*  it, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go very short term, like six months, seven months, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=135.92s)]
*  wait until this guy gets out, get the rates way down, and then go long term, because we have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=141.2s)]
*  a tremendous appetite for our debt, because our country is doing well. But think of it, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=147.28s)]
*  I got a call from Congress three nights ago, sir, we can't account for the money coming in. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=151.76s)]
*  I said, that's a good problem. You know, the bad problem is we don't have it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=157.2s)]
*  Next, Donald Trump starts ranting about how his approval rating has never been higher. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=160.56s)]
*  It's the lowest it's ever really been, and it's the lowest in presidential history at this time [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  during a term. Donald Trump is loathed, despised, and hated for his vile behavior, but here he just [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  goes lying, ranting, and raving like a lunatic. Play this clip. I think what she might be alluding [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=180.88s)]
*  to is the base is going to stay with you regardless, and you've gone through different [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  regardless. But some of the people in the base don't want a long term war. They're afraid that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=191.2s)]
*  we're going to get into a long term war. We're looking for a long term war. I only want one thing, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=196.0s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That's it. I'm not looking long term, short term, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=201.2s)]
*  and I've been saying that for 20 years. I've been saying it as a civilian who got a lot of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=205.12s)]
*  publicity. People would cover it. Very simply, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's not a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=209.04s)]
*  question of anything else. And if you did, you wouldn't have much of a country because they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=215.2s)]
*  would use it on us and they'd use it on other people and they'd be a terror all over the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=219.52s)]
*  So I may have some people that are a little bit unhappy now, but I have some people that are very [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=224.56s)]
*  happy and I have people outside of the base that can't believe that this is happening. They're so [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=229.36s)]
*  happy. And there was a poll that just came out today that my approval rating is the highest it's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  ever been. All I'm doing is saying you can't have a nuclear weapon. And I tried to do it nicely. And [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=238.08s)]
*  then on day 61, I said, let's go because we can't let that happen. And I've been saying it for 20 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=242.96s)]
*  years. Okay. I'm going to leave. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. And Donald Trump says that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=249.28s)]
*  he tells Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, just keep on going, keep on doing what you're doing. Play the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=256.16s)]
*  clip. But this looks better. Mr. President, can you share some of what you've told Israeli Prime [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=261.04s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? Keep going. What do I say? I speak to him every day. He's a good man, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=267.52s)]
*  doing a lot. Been very unfairly treated by his country, I think. Very unfairly treated. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=275.68s)]
*  Have you given him any indication that you may seek to aid them more than you have already? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=281.04s)]
*  No. So far he's done a good job. He has been treated very unfairly. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=286.24s)]
*  You know, he's a wartime president and he's going through this nonsense. It's ridiculous. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=293.2s)]
*  Sounds like you had a good meeting. Do you agree with him that- [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=298.4s)]
*  You who? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=300.4s)]
*  Yeah, your national security councillor. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Very good meeting. Anything that came up with it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=302.56s)]
*  Donald Trump whines about a 60 minutes interview that former Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=304.96s)]
*  gave to 60 Minutes in early October of 2024. This is part of that lawsuit that Donald Trump [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=312.32s)]
*  personally filed for $20 billion against CBS and its parent company Paramount. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=321.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is holding up the merger between Paramount and another company called Skydance, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=328.32s)]
*  until Paramount personally pays Donald Trump tens of millions of dollars. Reportedly, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=334.8s)]
*  they've already offered him $15 million, but Donald Trump wants more money from them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=340.56s)]
*  In my opinion, it's an absolutely frivolous lawsuit. Donald Trump's saying it's caused [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  him emotional distress and suffering because there were different versions of the interview [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=350.32s)]
*  that was aired. By the way, I watched the interview. There's really nothing that was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=355.76s)]
*  materially edited at all. This is all made up. Anyway, here's Donald Trump whining about that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=360.64s)]
*  on June 18th, 2025. Play this clip. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  So what they did is they interviewed 60 Minutes. They interviewed Kamala. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=369.36s)]
*  Her answer was horrendous. I would say election threatening. This is the day before the election. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Her answer was election threatening or so incompetent. So they took the entire answer out [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=379.36s)]
*  and they took another answer to another question and put it up. And they did that, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=385.2s)]
*  I understand, a number of times. But you don't have to do it a number of times. The main question [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=389.76s)]
*  they asked and we caught them. And they're very embarrassed by it. And they're working on a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  settlement. But think of it, did you ever hear of that one before? They took the entire, every word, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=400.64s)]
*  threw it out, put another answer. Do you think they do that for me? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=406.32s)]
*  I think it happens daily. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I've never seen it. I thought I was saying everything. That I've never seen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=412.88s)]
*  It's very embarrassing. And the head of 60 Minutes got fired. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=417.12s)]
*  The head of CBS got fired. They're all getting fired. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=420.8s)]
*  This season, I'm using Beekeepers Naturals products daily to proactively support my immune system, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=428.4s)]
*  especially as we enter peak travel and busy season through spring and summer. There's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=434.4s)]
*  nothing worse than getting sick right before a big trip. Beekeepers Naturals Nasal Spray and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=439.76s)]
*  Nasal Spray Max helps clear my congestion. It soothes and moisturizes the nasal passages [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=445.2s)]
*  so I can breathe deeply and easily. Beekeepers Naturals Sinus Support supports healthy histamine [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=451.2s)]
*  levels and promotes reduced sinus irritation and provides immune support. Now both products contain [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=458.16s)]
*  Propolis that reduces the histamine response that compass irritation for eyes, nose, and throat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=464.48s)]
*  Propolis is their hero ingredient, the medicine of the beehive that delivers antioxidants, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=471.44s)]
*  vitamin C, iron, B vitamins, and uniquely beneficial compounds that support immune health. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=478.16s)]
*  Not only are these products effective, I love Beekeepers Naturals mission of reinventing the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=485.28s)]
*  medicine cabinet, merging modern science with natural medicine to create clean, non-toxic [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=490.48s)]
*  products that actually work. Today Beekeepers Naturals is offering Midas Touch listeners [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=496.64s)]

*  Then Donald Trump says that he's like made up this deadline for Iran and he said on day 61, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=526.0s)]
*  I said, let's go, let's bomb them. When in fact, we know that the opposite is true, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=531.76s)]
*  then Netanyahu basically did it while Donald Trump was saying, we have negotiations scheduled [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=536.96s)]
*  for Sunday. And Donald Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=542.8s)]
*  had said publicly under oath that Iran did not have nuclear capabilities. But then when [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=547.04s)]
*  Donald Trump watched on Fox the decapitation strikes by Israel against the Iranian military [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=552.16s)]
*  generals that wiped out a lot of the generals, Trump wanted to take credit for it. So Trump said, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  I did it. Here, play this clip. All I'm doing is saying you can't have a nuclear weapon. And I [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  tried to do it nicely. And then on day 61, I said, let's go because we can't let that happen. And [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=568.56s)]
*  I've been saying it for 20 years. Donald Trump then lies and says that gas is as low as a dollar [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=575.12s)]
*  98 a gallon, which we all know is false. Play this clip. In California, you know, I've got, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=580.88s)]
*  we've got some gas stations where just two weeks ago it was a dollar 98, a dollar 99. We've got [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=585.36s)]
*  the gas down below and then we have this little situation which will drive it up a little bit, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  but very little. And it's going to come down again. It's going to give people a lot of extra [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=596.08s)]
*  money. Groceries are down. Eggs are down. You know, the eggs, they hit me the first week about eggs. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=601.52s)]
*  Next, Donald Trump says that he is going to be withholding important federal government [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=608.0s)]
*  aid from California because he doesn't like Governor Gavin Newsom of California. Let's play it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=614.48s)]
*  Now stuff with Governor Newsom impacts additional wildfire relief out there. They've requested 40 [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=637.12s)]
*  billion. Sure, the man's incompetent. He shouldn't have fires like that. You clean the floor of your [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=642.32s)]
*  forest and you won't have any forest. You know, Austria has very, very flammable trees. They don't [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=649.44s)]
*  have forest fires because they clean the floors. They maintain their forest. Good effect. You know, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=654.72s)]
*  um, hatred is never a good thing in politics. When you don't like somebody, don't respect [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=660.88s)]
*  somebody, it's harder for that person to get money if you're on top. But he's done a bad job. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=667.28s)]
*  Donald Trump says the difference between his first term and his second term is that in his first term [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  he was being hunted and now that he's the hunter, hunting people. So what Trump's saying at his [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=679.04s)]
*  press conference today about flagpoles, mind you, play this clip. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=684.56s)]
*  The first time I had it, but you know, you guys were after me. I said I had a focus. I was, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=691.04s)]
*  I was the hunted and now I'm the hunter. It's a big difference. But he was the same no matter why. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=695.92s)]
*  Yeah, it is surprising that. Donald Trump is asked about an ultimatum he gave Iran and he said, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  I gave them the ultimate ultimatum. Play the clip. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=710.72s)]
*  You could say so, they know, they know what's happening. Maybe you could call it the ultimate, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  the ultimate ultimatum, right? Oh, I don't want to say. Look, I mean, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  give me a break. What about the paramount deal? I would say the, uh, the other, she's doing great. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=733.44s)]
*  Then Trump says he spoke to Putin yesterday who offered to mediate the dispute between Israel and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=739.84s)]
*  Iran. Let's play it. You know, Russia, Ukraine is so stupid. Would it never happened if I was [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  president? You guys agree with that, right? Would it never happened if I was president? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=751.12s)]
*  Putin would have never done it. And I spoke to him yesterday and I said, you know, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=756.32s)]
*  he actually offered to help mediate. I said, do me a favor, mediate your own. Let's mediate [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=760.32s)]
*  Russia first. Okay. I said, Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=765.44s)]
*  but, uh, I think that's going to work out too, but it's so many people have been killed. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=771.84s)]
*  The big thing with that one is far more people are dead than have been reported in the Ukraine, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=777.28s)]
*  Russia, many, many more people, a building falls down. They say nobody was hurt. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=783.44s)]
*  Yeah. So we get Donald Trump talks about winning 35 club championships and he's upset that he [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=787.76s)]
*  hasn't hit a golf ball in three weeks to four weeks. Let's play it. When you, when you find [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=795.68s)]
*  time in your schedule, 35 club championships, you'll know that 35 club championships. I haven't [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=800.48s)]
*  hit a ball in three weeks. How many get out there? It's time to get a little busy. Would you rather [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=805.68s)]
*  have me be doing what I'm doing in the end? See the way they have that oyster. It's great. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=813.28s)]
*  Cause if you lift it up, uh, from one, you have to lift it from the bottom, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=819.1999999999999s)]
*  but you have to get it there. But if you lifted it from without that, the whole thing would split. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=824.56s)]
*  And then Donald Trump says that what they're doing with the flag pole is called a lifting. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  And he says he doesn't want to use the word with an E erection. Um, but he is calling it a lifting. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=836.88s)]
*  Cause if he says erection, then he will get made fun of by the media. Play the clip. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  Have a good, they call it a lifting. They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=848.24s)]
*  word. You know what that is? The word, it starts with an E. You know what the word is? If I ever [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  used it, I'd be run out of town by you people. All right. So enjoy it. You're going to get some [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=859.3599999999999s)]

*  be even more exciting, but this is pretty exciting. That's some equipment. I'll tell you what, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_3RE5q4RU&t=869.6s)]
