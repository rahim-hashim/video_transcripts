# Trump gets TERRIBLE NEWS and PANICS on SUNDAY
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI)
*  This has been an absolutely terrible morning for Donald Trump. The Midas Touch Network [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=0.0s)]
*  exposed that horrible commencement speech he gave in West Point. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=5.28s)]
*  Corporate News was trying to cover up. We played all of the clips where he ranted and raved about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=9.44s)]
*  Al Capone and trophy wives and where he said that he doesn't like stealth technology. Oh, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  and by the way, Donald Trump refused to shake the hands of the West Point grads, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=21.92s)]
*  which all former presidents have done. That's part of the tradition. When you give the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=27.36s)]
*  commencement speech, Donald Trump couldn't be bothered. Do you know why? Because he had to go [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=31.76s)]
*  play golf in Bedminster, New Jersey on the taxpayer dime. And here's what he's posting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=37.6s)]
*  this morning, I guess, to cover up that disastrous commencement speech. He's posting photographs [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=43.68s)]
*  of his friend that he's golfing with right now getting attacked by a bird on the golf course, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=50.24s)]
*  by a swan on the golf course. Here's what Donald Trump posted. I always said golf can be a dangerous [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=56.24s)]
*  sport, my friend being bit at Bedminster. Why don't you just, you know what I was going to say, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=63.2s)]
*  why don't you stand with our army grads and shake their hands? But your speech was so utterly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=70.8s)]
*  pathetic. It's probably best that you got the hell out of there because you embarrassed our nation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  enough with that despicable, vile trash that you were spewing. Donald Trump then posted this this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=80.88s)]
*  morning saying that he wants to see the names of all of the Harvard students. He wants them in his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  hands. He also claims that Harvard has $52 million. I think he means billion, but who the hell knows [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=94.24s)]
*  what he's even writing? Here's what he posted this morning. Why isn't Harvard saying that almost 31% [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=101.28s)]
*  of their students are from foreign lands? And yet those countries, some not all friendly to the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=108.56s)]
*  United States, pay nothing toward their students' education, nor do they ever intend to. Nobody told [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=115.92s)]
*  us that! We want to know who those foreign students are. A reasonable request since we give Harvard [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=123.92s)]
*  billions of dollars, but Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. We want those names and countries. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=132.08s)]
*  Harvard has $52 million. Use it and stop asking for the federal government to continue granting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=138.72000000000003s)]
*  money to you. So end of last week, Donald Trump attacks America's most profitable corporation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  Apple causes $80 billion in market cap loss. Apple stock is down 22% for the year, which is not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=153.76s)]
*  helpful for a lot of investors. Donald Trump attacks Harvard University, America's top university, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=162.56s)]
*  where students from across the world also go to study. We know the amount of foreign students [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=168.72s)]
*  there. This is a public number. We know that it's 29%. And Harvard was a beacon to try to get the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=174.56s)]
*  most talented students from the world, who then start jobs in the United States, who employ [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=182.56s)]
*  Americans. We took the brain drain from the rest of the world and brought them here to the United [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=188.48s)]
*  States, but Donald Trump is intent on destroying America's standing in the world in all respects, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=193.84s)]
*  attacking the United States from within, attacking our international alliances, attacking our education [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=200.96s)]
*  system. Donald Trump then posts the following this morning, you want to meet JD Vance? This is your [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  formal invitation. No, I do not want to meet JD Vance. Ben, do you have your outfit picked out? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=212.32s)]
*  Free flight, free hotel, photo with the vice president. You read that, right? This is an offer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  that you can't refuse. Right here, right now, you've got a chance to meet JD Vance. He runs all of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=224.0s)]
*  these scam competitions over and every day there's a new competition. If you give me this amount of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=233.68s)]
*  money, just you got to donate, you got to donate. I mean, just even look at the people who attended [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=239.44s)]
*  that crypto meme coin dinner thing that he held. And you saw our expose that we did here on the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=244.24s)]
*  Midas Touch Network before anyone else did it. We got all the photos and videos of what really [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=250.48s)]
*  went down inside. Remember, I was just showing you how just gross it looked inside also. And so there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=255.04s)]
*  was this article today on CNBC that was talking about how all of these people there who bought [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=260.8s)]
*  Trump's meme coin said the food sucked. We weren't given any drinks other than water or Trump's wine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=266.8s)]
*  I don't drink, so I had water and they only filled my glass up with water once. It should be noted [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=274.64s)]
*  that right after that meme coin dinner, guess what happened to the value of the meme coin? It dropped [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=281.04s)]
*  by like 15 or 18%. I think there were 55,000 people in total since that meme coin was released [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=286.64s)]
*  whose crypto wallets lost money. And there was a small group of people who actually earned money, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=294.08s)]
*  but really it was to get access with Donald Trump. And the only person making money off it really was [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=300.88s)]
*  Donald Trump who makes money off of the transaction fees. And we're learning more about Donald Trump's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=306.8s)]
*  international grift, his bribery schemes, his quid pro quo. For example, this morning it was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  reported by the New York Times that Vietnam ignored their own laws to fast track approval [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=319.28s)]
*  for a Trump golf resort and tower because they want tariffs lifted and the projects were quote [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=326.0s)]
*  receiving special attention from the Trump administration and Trump personally. So if you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  want US tariffs lifted, you got to build a Trump resort. That was the message being sent. Another [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=337.84s)]
*  message being sent while Donald Trump is posting photos of swans attacking his friends on the golf [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=345.36s)]
*  course. This is being reported from the Wall Street Journal, by the way, that federal judges [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  are now weighing taking control of their own security for themselves because they no longer [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  trust the US marshals. Because US marshals are on the payroll of the federal government, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=365.36s)]
*  which Trump controls. These federal judges are now worried that the US marshals will do more harm [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=372.4s)]
*  knowing their whereabouts than good because of what Donald Trump wants to do to federal judges. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what the United States of America has become under the Trump regime. But what would you expect? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=386.64s)]
*  What else would you expect from someone who goes in front of West Point and talks about how he [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=393.2s)]
*  was investigated more than Al Capone and that the Alphonse Capone, the late great Al Capone, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=399.84s)]
*  got investigated less than he did and he got more than Al Capone? Here's what Donald Trump said. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=407.84s)]
*  I'm just going to show you a short clip of it, a very short clip. Here, play this clip. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  ...and the American people because they're always going to be there for you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=416.88s)]
*  I went through a very tough time with some very radicalized, sick people and I say I was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  investigated more than the great late Alphonse Capone. Alphonse Capone was a monster. He was a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=427.52s)]
*  very hardened criminal. I went through more investigations than Alphonse Capone and now I'm [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=434.96s)]
*  talking to you as president. Can you believe this? Can you believe it? So you got to fight hard, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  you got to never give up and don't let bad people take you down. You got to let them, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=450.64s)]
*  you got to take them down. A lot of bad people out there and those people you have to figure it out [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=457.2s)]
*  but you also have a lot of great people. Finally, hold on to your culture and your traditions [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=462.24s)]
*  because that's what makes something really great and that's what's made the army great, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  the culture and the tradition. So while Donald Trump was golfing on the taxpayer dime in Bedminster, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=472.96s)]
*  New Jersey today, by the way, where his wife Ivana was buried so that I think Trump can get [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=479.6s)]
*  tax credits by calling Bedminster a funeral plot or a cemetery plot. By the way, I wonder if that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=486.88s)]
*  was the bird that was guarding Ivana's grave. Ivana's grave is in this area that's like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  in like the Marsh area and the Daily Mail did a report on it last year where Trump just allowed [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  all of the shrubs to grow over his former wife's grave. It's really horrific thing, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=508.72s)]
*  horrific stuff and that Trump's kids whose Ivana's their mom would be okay with that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just gross. But they're a gross family. Speaking of gross people, here's Maga Mike Johnson [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=517.28s)]
*  doing the morning shows. He did hit the rounds. He was asked about all of the nonpartisan [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=523.44s)]
*  Congressional Budget Office projections that this budget's going to be a disaster and add [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=529.2s)]
*  trillions to the deficit. Here's what he had to say, play the clip. Really important here too [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=534.24s)]
*  to point out Shannon is that some of the estimates, for example, by the CBO, the Congressional Budget [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=538.56s)]
*  Office, are wildly inaccurate. They're assuming a historically low growth rate in the economy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=543.28s)]
*  The elements of the big beautiful bill, the reason we're so excited is because it will be jet fuel to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  U.S. economy. This is going to foster a pro-growth economy again to get job creators and entrepreneurs [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  and risk takers moving again, expanding their businesses, adding more jobs. Wages will go up. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=559.28s)]
*  We'll have more manufacturing in the U.S. because of all the policies that we put into this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=564.4s)]
*  legislation. It's a long time coming and remember, not theoretical. We did this before in the first [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=568.24s)]
*  Trump administration. We brought in the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=573.76s)]
*  U.S. after just those first two years. Because we cut taxes and cut regulations, we're doing it again [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=577.84s)]
*  and on steroids this time. Let me ask you about a couple... By the way, that comes right off of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=582.96s)]
*  his talking points. So we did a report on this May 19th, 2025. The Hill was the first to report on it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=587.12s)]
*  These are the draft Congressional Budget Office versus Trump talking points that Maga Mike was [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=596.0s)]
*  putting out where he would say, the CBO is a leftist radical extreme organization. No, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=601.2s)]
*  it's a nonpartisan group within Congress, not leftist, not rightist. They just tell you what [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=606.08s)]
*  the impact on the deficit is going to be and what other financial implications are going to happen [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=613.36s)]
*  from the various bills. And Maga Mike and other Republicans would always use the CBO [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  when they could. This is from November 18th, 2021. Now that the CBO has confirmed the bill [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=624.72s)]
*  adds nearly 400 billion to the deficit, contrary to the White House's claim that the bill is paid [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=631.52s)]
*  for, let's see if moderate Democrats keep their promise. So that's what he wrote in 2021. Maga [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=636.32s)]
*  Mike goes on Face the Nation and he was asked about... Louisiana, and particularly your district [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=643.2s)]
*  as well, receives the second largest amount of food stamps in the entire nation. You're literally [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=649.92s)]
*  screwing over your congressional district and your state. Do you realize that? Here, play this clip. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=657.12s)]
*  Everyone acknowledges is real. It may be much higher than that. Louisiana is like the second [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=679.92s)]
*  largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  it. The states are not properly administering this because they don't have enough skin in the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  game. So what we've done in the bill is add just a modest state sharing component so that they'll [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=693.52s)]
*  pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud. Why? Again, so that it is preserved [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=698.4s)]
*  for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=702.88s)]
*  everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that. Next up, you have the FDA commissioner. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=706.96s)]
*  And here the FDA commissioner talks about how they're very proud that they're not going to be [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=714.32s)]
*  giving COVID boosters and vaccines to people under 65. So you probably have heard me report [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  their new policy is if you're under 65 and they determine that you're healthy, you cannot get [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=725.84s)]
*  COVID vaccines anymore. They're just depriving the American people of vaccines, withholding it [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=732.32s)]
*  based on their deranged anti-vax conspiracies. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=737.84s)]
*  And in a much bigger step, we're basically saying the day of rubber stamping COVID vaccines for young [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=741.44s)]
*  healthy kids is over. You cannot send us an application for a new COVID booster each year [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  with no new updated clinical trial data and expect the FDA just to blindly rubber stamp it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=754.72s)]
*  So in this New England Journal of Medicine article, Dr. Prasada and I basically said, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=760.64s)]
*  we've got a new framework because people don't trust us. You know, 15% of health care workers [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  got the booster last season and even fewer parents got the booster for their kids. So we've [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=770.56s)]
*  got to reevaluate this and use an evidence-based approach and common sense. I want to ask you about [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=776.8s)]
*  the- And finally, right here, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=782.0s)]
*  Maga Republican Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. Here's what he had to say about Trump's budget [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=784.24s)]
*  bill. He said, he basically said, Trump is the emperor with no clothes and someone needs to [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=790.8800000000001s)]
*  stand up to him. Play this clip. Somebody has to stand up and yell, the emperor has no clothes, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=796.08s)]
*  and everybody's falling in lockstep on this, pass the big, beautiful bill, don't question anything. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, conservatives do need to stand up and have their voice heard. This is a problem we've been [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=808.64s)]
*  facing for decades now, and if we don't stand up on it, I really fear the direction the country is [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=814.4s)]
*  going. Okay, the Senator, or excuse me, the Speaker- [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=819.84s)]
*  I think it's also very important that we talk about Donald Trump's attacks on climate. I always [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=821.52s)]
*  want to talk about climate in my videos right now. This from the Rolling Stones, they label it under [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=825.84s)]
*  death cult. Trump tries to make sure states don't fight climate change either. The Trump [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=831.44s)]
*  administration wants to block states from trying to limit the astounding costs and impacts of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=838.48s)]
*  climate change. So Trump's DOJ is going after states, whether it's New York and Vermont, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=844.32s)]
*  to stop them from enforcing a law passed last year that would make fossil fuel companies liable for [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  some of the costs dealing with climate change, suing Hawaii and Michigan over their climate [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=855.6s)]
*  related lawsuits against fossil fuel companies. And the Trump regime is working with the MAGA [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=860.4s)]
*  Republicans in the House and Senate to end California's motor vehicle emission standards [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=865.36s)]
*  and its cap and trade programs. So with all these Republicans talking about states' rights, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=871.52s)]
*  states' rights, states are saying, look, we need to protect our states from the impact of climate [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=878.8s)]
*  change. And the same way you have the Trump regime saying things like, well, we're going to prevent [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  you from getting the vaccine. At a federal level, we're going to stop you individually [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=889.5200000000001s)]
*  from even being able to make the choice to get the vaccine. On the climate front, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=893.7600000000001s)]
*  they're saying at the federal level, we're going to be preventing states from trying to keep their [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=897.44s)]
*  states clean. I mean, you just think about California. With all of the smog we used to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=903.2s)]
*  have, I mean, go back and look at photos from California in the 70s and the 80s. And that's why [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=907.44s)]
*  we had to take steps to stop that in California. And the Trump regime's like, we at the federal [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=913.2s)]
*  government want to interfere with that. And we want it to be smoggy and gross and have carcinogens [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=918.96s)]
*  everywhere. These are sick people. These are sick, sick human beings. These are vile. There's no [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=926.08s)]
*  other way to talk. These are trash humans in the Trump regime. I'm sorry if I'm name calling, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  but these are bad humans. It's not a political thing. These are bad people who hate Americans [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  and want us to suffer. We have to just recognize that. We have to come to that realization. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxmaWRaMFI&t=942.96s)]
