# Trump INSTANTLY TERRIFIED as NO KINGS Protests ERUPT
**MeidasTouch:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg)
*  That was one of the peaceful protests that are breaking out across the nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=0.0s)]
*  The one you just saw there was in Chicago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=18.76s)]
*  Now the MAGA Republican governors, just like Donald Trump, are terrified of the peaceful [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=21.64s)]
*  protests and they want to try to escalate matters by sending in the National Guard, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=28.4s)]
*  by threatening harm to the protesters, because they're hoping to provoke incidents so that they [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=34.08s)]
*  can try to justify their fascist tactics across the country and in the various states. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=40.64s)]
*  Look how terrified these MAGA Republicans are. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=47.2s)]
*  You have Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina saying, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  South Carolina's law enforcement will not tolerate lawless behavior associated with this weekend's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  nationwide planned protest, the No Kings protest. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  Have a nice weekend! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=65.92s)]
*  Who talks like that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Who talks like that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=69.6s)]
*  You should encourage and want to inspire people to have their First Amendment rights peacefully, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=70.88s)]
*  of course, as our editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski goes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Lots of threats from the tough guys today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  How about these signs on the fencing in front of Bunker Boys White House right now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=82.64s)]
*  These are the signs in front of the White House as they put up gates [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=89.44s)]
*  so that protesters can't get close to the White House. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=92.48s)]
*  They don't want to interrupt Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  It says, the sign says, Fence Jumpers will be prosecuted. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=98.72s)]
*  Apparently, it's a recycled sign from Lollapalooza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=103.36s)]
*  Then, of course, Florida's MAGA Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=108.08s)]
*  who MAGA doesn't even like because he's not Trumpy enough for MAGA. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=112.72s)]
*  Ron DeSantis goes on this show and he's in the past two days, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  he's basically encouraging people to drive their vehicles through protesters and kill them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  He's like, in Florida, we protect people who drive their vehicles through protesters and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=129.2s)]
*  run over people. This is how terrified they are of the peaceful protest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=136.96s)]
*  This is the type of scare tactics they use. Listen to what DeSantis has to say. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=140.56s)]
*  You know, because they're terrified of this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=166.96s)]
*  Look at what's going on in Los Angeles, California. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=173.52s)]
*  Here are some of the protesters dancing at the LA protests. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=176.24s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=179.28s)]
*  So you have Governor DeSantis of Florida. You saw at the beginning, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=180.32s)]
*  you have Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=199.92s)]
*  Here you have Governor Greg Abbott deploying thousands of Texas National Guard troops across [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=203.6s)]
*  Texas in preparation for the No Kings protest. Play this clip. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=209.84s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott is doubling down on his promise to send out [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=213.68s)]
*  Texas National Guard troops ahead of the No Kings protests across the state. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=217.36s)]
*  Fox four's Paige Elliburger live in Dallas, where there are multiple demonstrations planned [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=221.44s)]
*  for this weekend. Paige. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=226.24s)]
*  Brandon Lauren, good morning. Thousands of Texas National Guard troops will be deployed this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=229.04s)]
*  weekend. It's a similar move we've seen taken by President Donald Trump in California [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=233.04s)]
*  during anti-ice protests in the Los Angeles area. Governor Greg Abbott says he supports [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=237.76s)]
*  the president's decision to deploy troops and is doing so here in Texas as a precaution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=243.04s)]
*  With dozens of protests against the Trump administration's handling of immigration [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  scheduled across the state this weekend, the governor went on Fox News to defend his reasoning [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  for using state force. There were protests without any property being damaged or anybody being hurt. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=256.8s)]
*  And people are free to protest if they don't harm anything. However, because of the possibility, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=264.08s)]
*  because the size of the crowds could grow large, because things could get out of control, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=270.64s)]
*  we want to make sure that we have the assets in place where we were going to be able to quickly [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  respond. Abbott deploying 5000 National Guard troops as well as 2000 state troopers to monitor [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  protests tomorrow. It is unclear exactly how many will go where. At least eight protests are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=286.88s)]
*  scheduled here in the Dallas area for tomorrow, organizers reminding demonstrators to remain [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=293.28s)]
*  peaceful. And again, I just think about overwhelmingly the protests are peaceful [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  and they're joyous and there's music and there's dancing here. This is the enormous peaceful [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=304.88s)]
*  protest that we saw pretty much throughout Los Angeles. Most of it looked like this. Play this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  clip. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=316.8s)]
*  I found this interesting. You had the San Antonio police chief, McManus, and the San Antonio mayor, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=333.04s)]
*  Nirenberg were saying that they were never even informed by governor Abbott about the deployment [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=339.92s)]
*  of the National Guard who just rolled in to their city here. Play this clip. Mayor, why not get [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=345.28s)]
*  ahead of this? I asked the chief earlier because he says if they get deployed the guards, then he'll [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=351.28s)]
*  reach out. You know, why not be ahead of it? Be proactive. Say, hey, I mean, I'm not going to speak [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=356.32s)]
*  for the chief, but I'll give him credit. We weren't given this information. We had to go look for it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=360.96s)]
*  And so we're going to try to stay as coordinated as possible. You know, I think we have great law [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=366.4s)]
*  enforcement at every agency, but they're under command of somebody else. And so here in San [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=372.4s)]
*  Antonio, we have the best police department in the country under the command of the right person. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=377.2s)]
*  He's going to do everything we can to protect our local community and our local citizens. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=381.76s)]
*  And to show you again the fear tactics that's being used by the MAGA and like the MAGA sheriffs, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=386.64s)]
*  this is the MAGA Florida sheriff, Wayne Ivey. This is his speech to the people. He threatens to kill [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=392.64s)]
*  anti-Trump protesters here play this clip. If you resist lawful orders, you're going to jail. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=400.88s)]
*  Let me be very clear about that. If you block an intersection or a roadway in Brevard County, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=407.04s)]
*  you are going to jail. If you flee arrest, you're going to go to jail tired because we are going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=412.8s)]
*  run you down and put you in jail. If you try to mob rule a car in Brevard County, gathering around [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=418.24s)]
*  it, refusing to let the driver leave in our County, you're most likely going to get run over. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=425.36s)]
*  And dragged across the street. If you spit on us, you're going to the hospital and in jail. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=430.88s)]
*  If you hit one of us, you're going to the hospital and jail and most likely get bitten by one of our [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=438.32s)]
*  big beautiful dogs that we have here. If you throw a brick, a fire bomb or point a gun at one of our [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=444.24s)]
*  deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=450.4s)]
*  you graveyard dead. We're not going to play. This has got to stop. And again, what they're trying [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=456.48s)]
*  to do here is escalate. They want to provoke protesters. They're trying to inspire violence [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=462.56s)]
*  so that they could engage in exactly what they're saying. They want to utilize their fascist playbook. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  They want people to play into that. So they're intentionally being provocative and escalating [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=478.8s)]
*  things. Here's again, Maggot Republican Governor Ron DeSantis going on Fox and showing how scared [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=484.0s)]
*  he is of the no Kings protest. About 1800 of them are planned, including more than 75, they're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=490.32s)]
*  claiming in Florida itself. And that's the same day Trump is planning the military parade in DC, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=498.24s)]
*  flag day, army's 250th anniversary celebration, which in and of itself, that's driving the left [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=505.6s)]
*  crazy. They hate any display of patriotism or celebrating the of the military. They can't stand [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=511.92s)]
*  that. So governor, how are you preparing for these supposedly 75 protests across your state? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=517.44s)]
*  Our folks are ready at the state level. I mean, I think, as you know, the local police will be the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=528.96s)]
*  first to respond if anything goes wrong. County sheriffs will be there as well. We have our state [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=534.32s)]
*  law enforcement on standby. They'll be ready to go, whether it's the highway patrol, whether it's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=540.64s)]
*  Florida Department of Law Enforcement. And then we do have national guard who will be ready. But [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=545.92s)]
*  I got to tell you, we've dealt with this pretty effectively in the past. I mean, one of the things [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=551.12s)]
*  they're doing in Los Angeles. Yes, you see the looting, you see all that. They also just take [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=555.04s)]
*  over streets. Look, if you don't have a permit to take over streets, you can't just interrupt [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=560.4s)]
*  traffic. The Hamas people tried to do this when they were doing that a year or so ago. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=565.44s)]
*  They tried it in Miami. They were kicked off the road in 13 minutes. They tried it in central [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  Florida. Our highway patrol got them out of there in 11 minutes. So you're going to be held [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  accountable. The inmates are not going to run the asylum. So it's a bad decision to try to pull that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=580.0s)]
*  nonsense in Florida. So you ever sit down to work and your brain just won't cooperate? That was me [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  for so long. I find myself getting distracted scrolling through social media, just totally [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  unable to focus, especially with a job like this where I need to stay locked in productive, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=594.24s)]
*  creative, and on top of the news, distractions aren't just annoying. They can derail everything. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=598.64s)]
*  Then I found Brain FM and it's been a game changer. Brain FM is an app built for anyone seeking to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=603.52s)]
*  boost productivity. They create science back music that syncs brain patterns, helping you focus [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=608.16s)]
*  better, relax deeper and sleep easier. I use their deep work and creative modes daily. It's like [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=613.04s)]
*  flipping a switch in my brain. There's even a turbo mode specifically designed for ADHD support. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=618.08s)]
*  And this isn't hype. Brain FM is the only music company supported by a National Science Foundation [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=623.6s)]
*  grant and just published a peer reviewed study showing their patented tech improves attention [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=628.4s)]
*  and brainwave synchrony. Unlock your brain's full potential free for 30 days by going to brain.fm [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=632.96s)]
*  mitis. That's brain.fm mitis. That's M-E-I-D-A-S for 30 days free. I just love this scene right here. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  You have a Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters looking at the National Guard. And like, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=648.32s)]
*  there's only like a hundred National Guard who are actually operationalized at this point [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=655.12s)]
*  because there's no place to put the other, the 4,000 National Guard that Donald Trump [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=659.6s)]
*  federalized in Los Angeles. Watch Maxine Waters right here looking at these National Guard troops [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=664.32s)]
*  as they're like peaceful protests out there. It's like, what the hell are you doing? What [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=671.2s)]
*  are these weapons of war that you have here? Play this clip. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=674.56s)]
*  Take a look at this large immigration protest. Peaceful outside of the fan [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=696.4s)]
*  fest at the College World Series in Omaha. Not blocking traffic. Peaceful drums and chants. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=700.96s)]
*  Take a look right here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  No hate, no fear. Immigrants are welcome here. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=708.8s)]
*  And of course, we see Donald Trump trying to provoke things as well. Trump this week saying, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  When they spit, we hit. When the protesters spit, we're gonna hit him. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=735.28s)]
*  When they spit at people, you know, they spit. That's their new thing. They spit at worse. You [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=740.32s)]
*  know what they throw at them, right? And when that happens, I have a little statement they say, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  they spit, we hit. And I told them, nobody's gonna spit on our police officers. Nobody's gonna spit [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  on our military. Or Donald Trump saying that anybody who protests will be met with heavy force. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=760.88s)]
*  He's not saying if you're like a violent protester, he goes, if you protest his [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=766.48s)]
*  military parade, you will be met with violent force. Play this clip. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=771.04s)]
*  Celebrating big on Saturday. We're gonna have a lot of, and if there's any protester once they [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=774.72s)]
*  come out, they will be met with very big force. By the way, for those people that want to protest, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=778.96s)]
*  they're gonna be met with very big force. And I haven't even heard about a protest, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=783.84s)]
*  but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=788.0s)]
*  And then Donald Trump basically saying that there's gonna be no time limit to when the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=794.32s)]
*  National Guard will leave Los Angeles or other places in the country, whatever he wants. Play [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=799.12s)]
*  this clip. National Guard being California indefinitely, how long will they be there [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  until you think that- Until there's no danger. It's easy. Look, it's common sense. You asked me [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=808.8s)]
*  that question. When there's no danger, they'll leave. You would have had a horrible situation [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=815.12s)]
*  had I not sent them and horrible. It'd be reporting on a lot of death and a lot of [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=823.12s)]
*  destruction. That's not going to take place. I think if you look every night, it got less and less. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=828.48s)]
*  They were met with very strong force, the bad people, the bad sick people that do what they do. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=833.92s)]
*  But these are paid people in many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases. And [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=839.28s)]
*  they really are, they're agitators. Now contrast that to what Governor Newsom has said about [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=845.44s)]
*  the peaceful protests. Here, play this clip. He said be stubbornly peaceful. Play this clip. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=852.0s)]
*  Can we once and for all just dispense with this notion that this is all about going after dangerous [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=856.88s)]
*  criminals? Two days ago in Oxnard, California, there were ICE agents running through strawberry [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=861.12s)]
*  fields. People that have been working those fields for over 20 years. I know with a 12-year-old boy [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=866.08s)]
*  whose mom and dad were detained. He was left with nobody sitting there weeping and crying, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=872.0s)]
*  tears pouring down his face. Now today, just today in Los Angeles, reports are coming back [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=878.8s)]
*  that caregivers, babysitters entrusted with children and toddlers in parks in Los Angeles [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  had ICE agents rush on them and unmarked cars and take these children from the caregivers, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=894.8s)]
*  detaining these babysitters. Imagine being a parent of one of those children and getting a call [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  about what just happened. Any parent should be outraged, but all of us should be outraged by that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=908.56s)]
*  cruelty, by that conduct by the Trump administration. Tomorrow, he is going to have a birthday, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=913.76s)]
*  a vulgar display of weakness. And millions of people, I imagine millions of people are going to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  get out and protest. I ask you if you're filled with rage as I am by what is going on in the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=927.92s)]
*  militarization of great American cities, that when you're out protesting, you do it peacefully. Do [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=934.56s)]
*  not play in to Donald Trump. What he wants is chaos. That's the reaction that he hopes to get from us, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=941.8399999999999s)]
*  from this cruelty. Let's not give him what he wants. Let's exercise our constitutionally [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  protected rights, but let's do it peacefully. And again, contrast that to what they're doing in Texas [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=957.68s)]
*  where they've deployed national guard troops to San Antonio and other places. Again, trying to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=963.84s)]
*  provoke violence. Play this clip. One by one, Texas national guard troops were seen arriving in San [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  Antonio. Part of the contingent, Governor Greg Abbott deployed to counter the growing protests [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=975.52s)]
*  across the state. Hundreds of protesters marched through downtown San Antonio yesterday demanding [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=980.4s)]
*  an end to ice raids. When you see some of the operations that have been happening across the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=988.08s)]
*  country in here in San Antonio, is that why you're out here? It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=992.32s)]
*  I'm at the point where I don't even want to eat because whoever's all my people who are getting [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=998.48s)]
*  picked up and it's sickening. The nationwide protests are being driven partly by what president [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1003.44s)]
*  Trump has called his administration's aggressive immigration policy. The goal is to arrest nearly [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1009.2s)]
*  3000 undocumented immigrants per day. Videos on social media show ICE agents detaining several men [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1015.28s)]
*  in Dallas shortly after their immigration hearings were dismissed. In San Antonio, children and their [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1022.56s)]
*  families were zip tied at the federal courthouse. In Omaha, Nebraska, more than 70 migrants were [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1028.8s)]
*  taken into custody at a neat packing plant, including several family members of supervisor [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1035.52s)]
*  Stephanie Favilla. It looks on everybody's faces. It was just scared. And near Oxnard, California, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1040.56s)]
*  federal agents chasing migrants working in the fields. The intended effect is to cause fear. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1047.36s)]
*  Immigration attorney Jonathan Ryan says the stepped up enforcement is unprecedented. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  Many people are finding their lives upended because they can't go out. They can't take their [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1058.1599999999999s)]
*  kids to school. It is causing real terror. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. We've seen under [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1063.28s)]
*  this last week some operations that have been working to bring in criminals that have been out [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1069.84s)]
*  on our streets for far too long. Our HSI and ICE individuals have been out conducting operations with [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1075.84s)]
*  our government partners. We are expecting a court ruling from California very soon on whether the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  National Guard and the Marines can act as civil law enforcement for the planned protests on Saturday. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1088.6399999999999s)]
*  You may remember President Trump sent in the National Guard against the wishes of California [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1094.0s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. There you have it. MAGA is absolutely terrified. And just think about that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1098.16s)]
*  clip I showed you of DeSantis where he's encouraging people to run over the protesters. You heard him [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pxOGxHpkg&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
