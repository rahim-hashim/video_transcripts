# Trump SHUTS DOWN as World UNLEASHES FURY at him
**MeidasTouch:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec)
*  Donald Trump was once again golfing all day yesterday, and through a spokesperson, he leaked that he does not give an F about even trying to make appearances, that he cares about anything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=0.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that leaked out. We get it, Donald. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=13.8s)]
*  Also, Donald Trump's press secretary, Chief Propagandist Caroline Levitt, taking selfies like this with her $4,800 Louis Vuitton bag. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=17.3s)]
*  It must be nice, Caroline Levitt, as you and the Trump regime just literally mocks we the people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=28.9s)]
*  But the past 24 hours saw some of the biggest protests in the history of the United States of America. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=35.900000000000006s)]
*  The hands-off protests were absolutely stunning in scale, scope, and size here in the United States and abroad. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=43.7s)]
*  In an hour and a half, I'm going to post another video where I'm just going to devote it to all of the protests, highlight all of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=53.1s)]
*  But let me show you while Donald Trump was golfing what it looked like in Chicago. Play this clip. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=60.6s)]
*  Can we take over? No! [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=73.6s)]
*  Powerful, powerful stuff there. And let me show you also what it looked like in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=79.6s)]
*  Stand up! Rise up! Here it is right here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=86.1s)]
*  Powerful, powerful stuff right there. And as you know, the Midas Touch Network was broadcasting all of it here on our YouTube and across all of our social media platforms. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=89.6s)]
*  We take the responsibility and trust you've placed in us very seriously. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=107.6s)]
*  Obviously, we know how important it is that since we now are about to have 5 million subscribers and we're the most viewed news YouTube channel in the world, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=112.6s)]
*  it is critical that we cover what corporate news refuses to cover, the protests. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=122.6s)]
*  And they will continue to grow as we head into Democracy Summer. It's already here early. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=128.1s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the White House was also talking about in the past 24 hours. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=135.1s)]
*  This is real. This was a real press release issued by the White House. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=140.6s)]
*  Seriously, the President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, Florida, and advances to the championship round tomorrow. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=146.6s)]
*  That is a serious press release issued by the Trump regime. Not making that up. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=159.6s)]
*  They made that through their official formal White House press channels. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=166.6s)]
*  Well, Fox, State Regime Media picked it up. Here's what Fox posted. This was a real story that Fox ran yesterday. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=170.6s)]
*  Trump advances to championship round of Senior Club Golf Tournament days after imposing wave of tariffs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=179.6s)]
*  Well, at least they included the tariffs part there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=186.6s)]
*  As Ron Filipkowski, our editor-in-chief, says, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=190.6s)]
*  Donald Trump from the golf course posting this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=203.6s)]
*  We need tariffs on China. And he's quoting someone named Gordon Chang. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=206.6s)]
*  Donald Trump reposting this TikTok video that says Trump is purposefully crashing the market. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=211.6s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump is actually posting. This isn't AI. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=220.6s)]
*  It's a real post from the official account of Donald Trump saying Trump is purposefully crashing the market. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=224.6s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posts, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=231.6s)]
*  Her new show is doing great. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=241.6s)]
*  Well, I tuned in so you don't have to. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=244.6s)]
*  Let me show you what Mark Levin was saying when you tuned in so you can see this ridiculous state regime propaganda. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=247.6s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=255.6s)]
*  He is doing something that's never been done. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=257.6s)]
*  And it's actually quite exciting and invigorating. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=262.6s)]
*  Will there be a period of difficulty? I suspect there is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=267.6s)]
*  But a lot of that is the layover from the Biden regime, which spent like a bunch of drunken Marxists. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=270.6s)]
*  Now, last night as well, Marjorie Taylor Greene posted the following photo. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=276.6s)]
*  It's my baby boy's birthday. He's 22. I love him so much. Heart. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=281.6s)]
*  Buy him a beer. And then it has a link to Venmo to buy her son Derek. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=287.6s)]
*  It links to Derek's personal Venmo. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=294.6s)]
*  And it's a photo of him, I guess, younger killing a deer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=297.6s)]
*  And you can send money to him on Venmo. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=302.6s)]
*  So as Americans are losing their life savings, as our 401ks are now 201ks or 0ks at this point, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=306.6s)]
*  as the Trump regime is destroying our life savings, destroying our retirement funds, destroying the market, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=315.6s)]
*  destroying the economy, destroying our businesses, Donald Trump's golfing, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=322.6s)]
*  Caroline Levitt as chief propagandist is frolicking with Louis Vuitton bags and taking selfies about how rich apparently she is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=326.6s)]
*  And Marjorie Taylor Greene is begging for money so that we can buy her son a beer for his birthday. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=334.6s)]
*  Absolutely repulsive. Absolutely ridiculous. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=342.6s)]
*  Absolutely vile. This another headline worth talking about. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=347.6s)]
*  Trump's family cash registers ring as financial meltdown plays out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=353.6s)]
*  The party was on in Florida where Donald Trump was golfing, yay, at the Saudi-backed Live golf tournament [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=359.6s)]
*  at the President's Doral Resort in Florida and a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, even as the markets tumbled. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=367.6s)]
*  So the Trump regime celebrating and having the time of their lives. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=375.6s)]
*  Talk about international news for a second. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=380.6s)]
*  On the one hand, in Canada, you have Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, saying, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=383.6s)]
*  We will win the trade war against the United States. Prime Minister Carney standing up very powerfully to the Trump regime. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=390.6s)]
*  Notably, if you take a look at this from a service called Blind Spot, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=400.6s)]
*  which is brought to you by Ground News, which I do to do my research, you see here nobody on the right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=407.6s)]
*  No right wing media is talking about Prime Minister Carney standing up to Donald Trump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=415.6s)]
*  You know why? Because the right wing is a bunch of snowflakes and they are not covering it at all. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=421.6s)]
*  What's also interesting is how the right wing, though, they're not covering that story, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=428.6s)]
*  but this is what they're bragging about as well. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=434.6s)]
*  And again, you can see on the Blind Spot like who's covering it, who's not covering it, and that's brought to you by Ground News. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=437.6s)]
*  Ground News happens to be one of our sponsors. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=444.6s)]
*  It says Trump says Vietnam willing to cut tariffs on U.S. goods to zero to reach deal. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=447.6s)]
*  And you see that's what the right wing covers on this Blind Spot feature that I use 76 percent right and 9 percent left. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=455.6s)]
*  But do you notice why? Because it's framed as Trump says when Trump says that's usually an indication that it's lying. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=463.6s)]
*  So I use this. I use Blind Spot when I do these videos in the morning and I do these videos in the evening as well, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=473.6s)]
*  because I want to know what's the strategy going on here by the right wing and I even want to know what's other kind of news media covering. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=481.6s)]
*  So I use Blind Spot. That's the feature that I just showed you. It's pretty great. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=490.6s)]
*  It lets you burst out of your political bubble and you get better understand how these things are being framed. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=494.6s)]
*  I use Ground News. I think it's essential nowadays. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=501.6s)]
*  You got to go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code here. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=504.6s)]
*  We're going to give our viewers 40 percent off Ground News top tier vantage plan right here right now, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=510.6s)]
*  which will get you unlimited access to everything I've shown you and more. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=515.6s)]
*  The research tool that I'm literally using right now as I'm talking to you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=519.6s)]
*  Ground News is subscriber funded so they don't rely on ads that could also introduce bias. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=523.6s)]
*  Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the media transparent. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=527.6s)]
*  One more time. It's ground.news.mtn. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=533.6s)]
*  Notably, this is interesting. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=540.6s)]
*  Elon Musk, as his Tesla stock is tanking, as his net worth is crashing right now, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=542.6s)]
*  he is fighting with Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's top economic advisor. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=549.6s)]
*  So Elon Musk made a video yesterday saying that he hopes the U.S. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=555.6s)]
*  and Europe move to a zero tariff situation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=561.6s)]
*  So after Donald Trump announced Liberation Day, which is Annihilation Day, Recession Day, Great Recession Day, Destruction Day, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=564.6s)]
*  Elon Musk is making videos now saying he wants to see zero tariffs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=571.6s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=575.6s)]
*  And I'm hopeful, for example, with the tariffs that at the end of the day, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=576.6s)]
*  I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=581.6s)]
*  ideally in my view, to a zero tariff situation, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=586.6s)]
*  effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=590.6s)]
*  And that would be my, that's what I hope occurs. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=595.6s)]
*  And also more freedom of people to move between Europe and North America, if they wish. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=603.6s)]
*  If they wish to work in Europe or wish to work in America, they should be allowed to do so in my view. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=609.6s)]
*  So that has certainly been my advice to the president. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=616.6s)]
*  And also Elon Musk is attacking Peter Navarro and saying Peter Navarro's never built S word. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=622.6s)]
*  I want to share this with you as well. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=629.6s)]
*  Jim Cramer, who is someone who masquerades as a financial analyst on CNBC, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=631.6s)]
*  he now believes there will be a 1987 Black Monday tomorrow, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=637.6s)]
*  that he believes the stock market will crash tomorrow worse than it ever did before, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=642.6s)]
*  and that he thinks that he's been played by Donald Trump and that he got suckered. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=648.6s)]
*  You think, Jim, maybe you had a responsibility as someone in finance to know what the world is going to look like. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=653.6s)]
*  You know what was going to happen the way we were warning people. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=660.6s)]
*  But whatever. Canada warns travelers to the US to expect border scrutiny, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=664.6s)]
*  including possible phone and device searches. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=669.6s)]
*  So there's travel warnings from other countries basically don't travel to the US. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=671.6s)]
*  UBS says that if Trump's reciprocal tariffs stay the way they are, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=676.6s)]
*  inflation will shortly skyrocket to about 5%. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=680.6s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier in the video, in about an hour and a half, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=684.6s)]
*  that's why you got to keep checking back on this YouTube channel. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=688.6s)]
*  The next video I'm going to load is going to be, I'm going to highlight all the protests. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=691.6s)]
*  I'm going to go one by one. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=695.6s)]
*  I may miss some cities, and I'm sorry if I miss your city. I really am. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=697.6s)]
*  But I'm going to do as many cities as I can. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=701.6s)]
*  Take a look right here. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=703.6s)]
*  The penguins showed up to protest a hands-off event, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=704.6s)]
*  and they've got the photo of Donald Trump, the portrait from Colorado that Donald Trump hates, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=708.6s)]
*  Trader in Chief, the penguins are pissed. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=713.6s)]
*  You've got this one, pretend where Melania hands off. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=715.6s)]
*  So you had incredible signs. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=719.6s)]
*  Again, I'm going to highlight that soon. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=722.6s)]
*  Let me share this with you as well. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=724.6s)]
*  Cory Booker, Senator Booker. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGGikOoWec&t=727.6s)]
