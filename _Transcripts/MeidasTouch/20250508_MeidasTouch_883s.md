# WOW! Trumpers DESTROYED in Virginia over MAJOR BLUNDERS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs)
*  What in the world is going on in Virginia? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=0.0s)]
*  The MAGA Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, as I call him, MAGA in a vest, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=3.24s)]
*  has just vetoed two bills that would have guaranteed Virginians access [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=8.64s)]
*  to contraception, marking the second time that he's blocked efforts [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=13.48s)]
*  to protect birth control rights through state law. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=17.98s)]
*  Not one, but two right there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=21.8s)]
*  House Bill 1716 and Senate Bill 1105, also known as the Virginia [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=23.68s)]
*  Right to Contraception Act, was passed by the Democratic [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=28.34s)]
*  Control General Assembly earlier this year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=31.28s)]
*  The bills were designed to preserve access to contraceptives, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=34.22s)]
*  such as birth control pills, IUDs and emergency contraception, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=37.28s)]
*  particularly in the wake of the U.S. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=41.18s)]
*  Supreme Court overturning Roe v. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=42.74s)]
*  Wade. And after it passed in the House and the Senate, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=45.08s)]
*  the MAGA Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin dismissed the legislation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=48.92s)]
*  and said, why do we need it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=52.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled on this in 1965. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=54.54s)]
*  In the Griswold case in 1972 in Eisenstadt, be bare. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=57.78s)]
*  And we trust the Supreme Court is not like they just overturned Roe v. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=61.78s)]
*  Wade in the Dobbs decision. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=65.18s)]
*  So we've got that coming out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=67.18s)]
*  And then it resurfaced that the MAGA Republican [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=68.54s)]
*  Governor candidate in Virginia for the upcoming elections in November, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=71.62s)]
*  Winsome Earl Sears in her capacity as Lieutenant Governor, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=76.28s)]
*  she wrote a formal objection to a bill that was eventually signed into law [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=81.08s)]
*  that was basically saying that she was morally against interracial [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=86.64s)]
*  marriages and same sex marriages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=91.48s)]
*  The bill would have and it did was signed into law protecting interracial [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=93.98s)]
*  couples and same sex marriage, same sex marriages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=98.18s)]
*  And she was against that. Oh, yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=101.44s)]
*  And then there was the Midas clip that went viral about Winsome Earl Sears, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=103.38s)]
*  where she just doesn't get what you're going through. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  And here in this clip, she talks about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  how she doesn't understand why workers are that upset that they're getting fired. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  And she's like, you know, just just get over it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=120.64s)]
*  Virginians, just dear Virginians, just get over it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  Here, let's play this one. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=125.58s)]
*  I think it's created by the Democratic Party of Virginia [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=127.14s)]
*  and actually use our research. That's pretty cool. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=129.42s)]
*  Unemployment claims in Virginia are skyrocketing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=132.18s)]
*  Northern Virginia unemployment claims rose seven point one percent in February. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=134.68s)]
*  Over fifty three thousand people unemployed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=139.18s)]
*  Virginia families are dealing with the economic fallout. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=141.82s)]
*  And what does Winsome Earl Sears have to say? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=144.42s)]
*  So if you lost your job and how many here has ever lost a job? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=147.32s)]
*  Oh, you mean it's not unusual? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  It happens to everybody all the time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=156.56s)]
*  Oh, and the media is making it out to be this huge, huge thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=158.78s)]
*  And I don't understand why. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=164.72s)]
*  Yeah, yikes on that one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=166.56s)]
*  Let's bring in the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=168.16s)]
*  also former congresswoman from Virginia and former intelligence officer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=172.82s)]
*  Well, what are we what were we looking at there? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=177.72s)]
*  I guess we'll start in reverse order. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=179.5s)]
*  I mean, number one, you have the MAGA Republican candidates saying, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=181.56s)]
*  who cares if you lose your jobs? It's not it's not a big deal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=186.16s)]
*  No, we're we're wine. Let's start with that one. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=189.16s)]
*  Wow. Well, Virginians want and deserve a governor who is going to stand up for them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  We have more than 320,000 federal employees here in the Commonwealth of Virginia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=198.16s)]
*  And we know that across our communities, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=204.56s)]
*  we are just facing dire, dire impact as people are losing their jobs, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=207.96s)]
*  as people are worried that they might lose their jobs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=213.66s)]
*  And importantly, when you have such a density of population [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=216.26s)]
*  of federal employees and federal employment, as we do in northern Virginia [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=220.3s)]
*  and in Hampton Roads, we have entire economies of contracting companies [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  and of local restaurants and local small businesses [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  that are used to relying on their community for patronage and for business. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=233.56s)]
*  And that means that if you have Virginians who are losing their jobs [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  because of these doge cuts, because of the choices of this administration, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  that they're not taking their families out to dinner. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=249.1s)]
*  They're not going to the local restaurant down the street. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=252.16s)]
*  And the economic impact is enormous. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=256.5s)]
*  Just recently, Old Dominion University put out an estimate [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=259.54s)]
*  that the impact last year of the federal workforce in Virginia [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=263.16s)]
*  was forty four billion dollars in economic output to what it added to the state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=267.66s)]
*  And so the attack on the federal workforce, sure, it's about the people [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  who are losing their jobs and losing their livelihoods and their commitment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=277.04s)]
*  And we're talking nurses at the VA and researchers at the NIH. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=280.36s)]
*  But we are also talking about the larger economy in Virginia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=286.1s)]
*  And so it's just it's so out of touch with everything I am hearing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=291.3s)]
*  when I travel across the Commonwealth, because we are all impacted [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=295.36s)]
*  here in Virginia by these cuts, by the attack on the federal workforce. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=300.0s)]
*  And the fact that she doesn't even understand that is just stunning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  So you have the mega Republican candidate, Winston Earl Sears. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=308.6s)]
*  You have the mega Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=312.6s)]
*  And just at like a human level for me, the level of gaslighting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  coming out from them and the level of just not having the back of Virginians. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=319.98s)]
*  Like to me, I don't even know what they think their job is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=324.6s)]
*  It's like it'd be like a coach of a sports team rooting against their team. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=328.18s)]
*  And then like when you call time out and you're in the huddle, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=334.18s)]
*  like you just start punching your team and like breaking their legs [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=337.3s)]
*  and basically saying everybody's broken their leg before. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  You're whining that your leg just got broken. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  Come on, everyone breaks their leg. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=346.2s)]
*  And it's like, why? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=348.0s)]
*  Why are you just normalizing at a basic level cruelty to Europe, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=349.7s)]
*  to the people living in Virginia? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=354.7s)]
*  And being so dismissive, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=357.2s)]
*  So they the lieutenant governor, my opponent and our governor, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=359.5s)]
*  they have pushed out a website. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  They have given advice saying that people should go to LinkedIn [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=369.7s)]
*  and go to Indeed to find new jobs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=373.7s)]
*  And they've given like literally at a press conference, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=376.78s)]
*  they talked about how you should look for keywords in job advertisements [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=378.9s)]
*  and put those in your cover letter. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=383.2s)]
*  And again, it just doesn't even begin to understand the reality [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  of what's happening in Virginia. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=389.34s)]
*  If you worked in international aid and development, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  you're not just going to transfer over to a new role. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=395.3s)]
*  If you were a nurse at the VA and you have devoted yourself [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=398.8s)]
*  to providing health care to our nation's veterans, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  but you work at the VA because you believe in it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=409.1s)]
*  and the dismissive nature that they are taking with these layoffs [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=412.20000000000005s)]
*  is outrageous. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=416.8s)]
*  But the fact that they are not even acknowledging the impact [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  on our economy is just unbelievable. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  It's stunning actually. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=424.8s)]
*  Talk about the veto of this right to contraception [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  because many people were saying after Dobbs overturned Roe v. Wade, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  the next thing that the MAGA Republicans are coming for is contraception. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=437.6s)]
*  So it seems here, you know, the Democratic-led assembly was just like, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  okay, well look, trust but verify. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=447.6s)]
*  Okay, you know, at the end of the day, sure, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=451.1s)]
*  there's Supreme Court rulings from 1970 and 1960s on this, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  but so was Roe v. Wade. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  You all promised us Roe v. Wade was never going to get overturned [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=460.1s)]
*  that it was super precedent. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=463.6s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=464.70000000000005s)]
*  Let's just line it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=466.1s)]
*  Let's say that it's a let's just put it in law [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  so we can never go back on it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=471.1s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=473.5s)]
*  And then the fact that the MAGA Republicans, you know, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=474.9s)]
*  led by Youngkin, you know, vetoed that, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=478.5s)]
*  it's like, what are we, where are we living? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=482.8s)]
*  I mean like, is, I mean, is Virginia now, you know, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=485.2s)]
*  under Youngkin like the Taliban? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=489.2s)]
*  I mean, seriously, what are we, like, what are we talking about? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  And why is it that politicians think they get to legislator dictate [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=494.7s)]
*  whether you can go out and get contraception? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=499.9s)]
*  It's, it's really unbelievable. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=503.3s)]
*  And then to say, oh, this isn't necessary because the Griswold [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=505.6s)]
*  decision makes clear that one has the right to purchase [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=509.1s)]
*  or to obtain birth control. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=514.3s)]
*  Well, yes, but we now know, like, clearly that what, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=516.6s)]
*  when people say, oh, it's settled case law, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=521.5s)]
*  that if there are motivated people who want to take rights away, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=524.4s)]
*  they can find a way. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=529.0s)]
*  And so anyone who says, okay, well, you know, Griswold, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=530.6s)]
*  they're the right to contraception and exist at the federal level [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=533.4s)]
*  because of the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=536.0s)]
*  Well, then you shouldn't mind just making sure, just putting that bill [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=538.0s)]
*  into place at the state level. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=542.6s)]
*  And so, you know, this is the second year in a row that the governor [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=544.5s)]
*  has vetoed this legislation, notably my opponent voted against it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, looking towards the future, I presume that the General [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=554.1s)]
*  Assembly is going to try again to pass this bill next year. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=558.5s)]
*  And, you know, my opponent is running for governor now. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=562.8s)]
*  She voted against it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=564.9s)]
*  We know that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=565.9s)]
*  But if she were to be governor, would she sign this bill into law [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=567.1s)]
*  or would she join Governor Youngkin in vetoing it? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=570.8s)]
*  Because I know one thing for sure as governor, when this bill [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=574.3s)]
*  gets to my desk, I will sign it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=577.8s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=581.2s)]
*  I mean, my opinion is if she's vetoing protections on interracial [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=582.2s)]
*  marriage and same-sex marriage, something leads me to believe, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=587.9s)]
*  she finds that morally objectable, leads me to believe that there's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=592.5s)]
*  a line of thinking there and along the lines of vetoing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=596.6s)]
*  the right to contraception. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=601.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=602.3s)]
*  Finally, Congresswoman Spanberg, let me ask you this. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=602.6s)]
*  Just what areas do you think are not getting enough attention [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=605.9s)]
*  that you're focused on as you're out there shaking hands, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=609.4s)]
*  you're speaking to people? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=612.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you think, you know, with the huge audience that we have, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=614.6s)]
*  that they need to be hearing about what's happening in Virginia? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=617.4s)]
*  Well, Virginia is a 2025 race. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=621.0s)]
*  I will be on the ballot this November. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=623.9s)]
*  And importantly, while we've talked about some of the issues [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=627.0s)]
*  that are important here in Virginia and the threats to the federal [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=629.8s)]
*  workforce, it is an issue everywhere across the country, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=633.9s)]
*  but Virginia is particularly impacted. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=636.0s)]
*  What we are seeing at the national level, at the federal level, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=638.9s)]
*  is such a distraction from the everyday challenges that Virginians [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=641.9s)]
*  certainly are feeling and are facing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=646.7s)]
*  Everywhere I travel across Virginia, I hear about the challenges [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=649.3000000000001s)]
*  of affordability. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=653.5s)]
*  You know, people are working multiple jobs. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=655.1s)]
*  They are trying to make ends meet. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=657.1s)]
*  And yet it is difficult to walk into the grocery store and buy [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=659.2s)]
*  everything on your list without wondering and trying to do the math [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=663.2s)]
*  in advance, is that credit card going to be maxed out? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=666.3000000000001s)]
*  Can you actually afford that dozen of eggs? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=673.9000000000001s)]
*  Which cereal should you get for the kids? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  Because man, oh man, those prices keep going up. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=676.5s)]
*  Or if you're starting a family and you want to put down roots and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=679.5s)]
*  you want to buy a house, can you even buy a house in Virginia? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=682.3s)]
*  Are you priced out of the market? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=685.8s)]
*  Can you live in the place where you want to live? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=687.3s)]
*  And while there is all this chaos at the federal level, while we see [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=690.3s)]
*  attack after attack from this administration, you know, across [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=693.6999999999999s)]
*  the Commonwealth, Virginians want a governor who's going to put them [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=697.5s)]
*  first. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=701.5s)]
*  They want a governor who is going to focus on actually addressing [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=701.9s)]
*  issues of affordability in our health care and in our housing market. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=705.6s)]
*  They want a governor who's going to recognize that the strength of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=710.9s)]
*  our public schools is what creates opportunity for their kids into [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=713.6s)]
*  the future. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=718.3s)]
*  I'm a product of Virginia Public Schools, both, you know, as a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=718.8s)]
*  kid and then from the University of Virginia, a proud public [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=723.5s)]
*  university in our Commonwealth. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=727.4s)]
*  I've got three kids in public school here in Virginia, elementary, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  middle and high school. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  And so I think what I want people to know is that in Virginia, we [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  are a bellwether state, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=739.3000000000001s)]
*  We are the first ones. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=741.3000000000001s)]
*  This year, we have a chance to flip our governorship. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=743.2s)]
*  We currently have a Republican governor. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=746.3000000000001s)]
*  We currently have a Republican lieutenant governor and we currently [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  have a Republican attorney general. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=751.2s)]
*  All three of those positions are elected separately this November. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=753.3000000000001s)]
*  And so we have a chance to flip three statewide seats. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=757.7s)]
*  We have a chance to demonstrate certainly here in Virginia that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=761.7s)]
*  that a governor that they elect will focus on the issues that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=765.6s)]
*  matter to them that will focus on standing up for our Commonwealth. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=769.4000000000001s)]
*  But importantly, the rest of the country will get to see what it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  is that we achieve here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=778.2s)]
*  And I hope that well, I know that we will set a good example because [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=779.7s)]
*  in addition to those three statewide seats, we also have a hundred [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=784.1s)]
*  seats in the House of delegates up for election this year, all 100. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=789.0s)]
*  We currently have a Democratic majority of 51 and we know this [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=793.6s)]
*  year with solid candidates running across Virginia that we can [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=797.9s)]
*  expand our majority and we can send a message to the rest of the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=801.7s)]
*  country about the fact that while we are facing these challenges [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=805.0s)]
*  while things feel awful and chaotic, we absolutely can flip [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=808.9s)]
*  seats and win seats. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=814.1s)]
*  We're going to do it in Virginia this November and we look forward [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  to seeing the rest of the country follow our very, very good example. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=819.6s)]
*  Where can people find out more about the campaign? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=823.5s)]

*  And I'm just grateful that we can set that good example for the rest [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=837.3s)]
*  of the country and in doing so really do right by our fellow [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=841.6s)]
*  Virginians here in the Commonwealth. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=845.0s)]
*  Want to remind our viewers and listeners that is this year. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbt0NsiQjs&t=846.9s)]
