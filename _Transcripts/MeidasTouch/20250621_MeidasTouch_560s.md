# ðŸš¨ United States ENTERS WAR Against IRAN!!!
**MeidasTouch:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE)
*  It is official. The United States is currently at war. The United States has entered Israel's war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=0.0s)]
*  against Iran. Donald Trump has just posted that the United States military has hit three nuclear [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=7.2s)]
*  sites in Iran. Let me repeat, the United States is at war. Let me read for you what Donald Trump [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=15.68s)]
*  posted. We have completed our very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=23.52s)]
*  including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran airspace. A full payload [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=30.48s)]
*  of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=39.2s)]
*  Congratulations to our great American warriors. There is not another military in the world [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=46.32s)]
*  that could have done this. Now is the time for peace! Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=53.04s)]
*  Let me repeat, the United States is currently at war in Iran. The United States joining Israel, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=61.6s)]
*  apparently with no other allies, US and Israel. Donald Trump Netanyahu against Iran. Donald Trump [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=69.12s)]
*  just posts, I will be giving an address to the nation at 10 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m. Pacific at the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=77.12s)]
*  White House regarding our very successful military operation in Iran. This is an historic moment. This [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  is all in caps now for the United States of America, Israel, and the world. Iran must now agree to end [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=93.04s)]
*  this war. Thank you! So after attacking Iran, Donald Trump is saying it was a successful [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=100.48s)]
*  operation and that Iran must now end the war after the United States just bombed Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  It conjures images in my mind of when George W. Bush went on the ship and had the mission accomplished [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=114.4s)]
*  and the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=123.68s)]
*  hours of an operation. Donald Trump also reposted open source Intel account that says 4DO is gone. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=128.08s)]
*  We're learning some additional information about the strike as well. Reports out of Iran right now [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  of some of the most heavy wide spectrum jamming of the war. Radios, GPS, and cell are all experiencing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=145.28s)]
*  heavy degradation, most likely US electronic warfare supporting the strikes. We also believe that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=153.6s)]
*  the B2s that were sent to Guam that we had been reporting about earlier in the day were a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=162.64s)]
*  diversion. Other B2s likely took off towards Iran is what this account is saying and many others [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  in the intelligence space are saying as well. Trump announced that US forces have struck Natanz, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  4DO, and Isfahan nuclear facilities in Iran and all aircraft are now out of Iranian airspace. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=184.4s)]
*  An important thing to think about as well as this account notes, I would not want to be on a tanker [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  in the Strait of Hormuz right now. Very difficult hours ahead as the US and other Gulf nations [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=197.12s)]
*  look to secure shipping. One of the things that Iran said it would do would be to shut down [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=205.44s)]
*  the Strait of Hormuz and if that were to take place, that's where all of the oil leaves the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=212.0s)]
*  Middle East from on its way to its destinations. That could have a massive shock on the supply chain [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=218.4s)]
*  of oil. Additionally, three senior Iranian officials have told the New York Times that they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=225.76s)]
*  believe American forces had bombed 4DO and Natanz around 2.30 a.m. in Iran time. This is how [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=232.64s)]
*  Mark Montgomery III retired a general. Here's how he had to say it or how he was discussing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=243.2s)]
*  how US military assets were critical to destroying the nuclear facility. Play this clip. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Your thoughts on the targets and what about 4DO? Exactly right. They've hit Natanz, Isfahan, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=259.12s)]
*  and other Iraq and other sites here and done significant damage. They've been around 4DO, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=265.44s)]
*  but the reality is the president's right. Prime Minister Netanyahu said they could take 4DO. I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=271.52s)]
*  think a fair statement is they could do significant damage to 4DO, but the only way you're going to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=276.8s)]
*  destroy 4DO, and it's not a guarantee, but the only possible way are B-2 stealth bombers delivering [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  the GBU-57, that 30,000 pound weapon. Now here was the prior report about the United States moving [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=288.08s)]
*  B-2 bombers to the Pacific island of Guam earlier. Play this clip. The United States is moving B-2 [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  bombers to the Pacific island of Guam as President Donald Trump weighs whether the US should take [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=302.64s)]
*  part in Israel's strikes against Iran. The bomber deployment was relayed to Reuters on Saturday by [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  two US officials. It's unclear whether the move is tied to Middle East tensions. The B-2 can be [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=315.12s)]
*  equipped to carry America's 30,000 pound GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator designed to destroy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=321.36s)]
*  targets deep underground. And then Donald Trump met with his national security council [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=329.04s)]
*  within the past few hours. He was previously in Bedminster, New Jersey golfing, and he was talking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=335.36s)]
*  to the new members at his club in Bedminster, then congratulated the new members, then went back [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=343.36s)]
*  to Washington, DC to meet with the national security council where it's believed that all [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=352.8s)]
*  these operations were taking place. Israeli media is saying that Israel has known for several days [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  that Trump is, quote, on board, and yet Israel and the US together created the feeling that there are [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  disagreements in the American leadership in order to lull the enemy. There have been reports of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=371.84s)]
*  tense conversations and of talks that are supposed to take place the next week. The goal was to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=377.11999999999995s)]
*  create a diversion, allegedly, to prevent the Iranians from rushing to take action. But it [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=382.08s)]
*  should be noted as well that the United States was signaling to other countries. Remember, two weeks [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=387.84s)]
*  that it would try to see if there was a path towards negotiation. Many people are saying that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=393.84s)]
*  two carries worth of Navy EA-18G growlers were supporting this operation as well. Here's a clip [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=400.4s)]
*  right here of Donald Trump saying multiple times that he would never start a war in the Middle East [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  and attacking others, neocons, et cetera, who have started wars in the Middle East before. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=415.12s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. These globalists want to squander all of America's strength, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=420.96s)]
*  blood, and treasure, chasing monsters and phantoms overseas. In addition, there must also be a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=426.8s)]
*  complete commitment to dismantle the entire globalist neocon establishment that is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=434.48s)]
*  perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=441.68s)]
*  We should have never gone into the Middle East. We should have never gone into the Middle East. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=448.72s)]
*  Under my leadership, we will turn the page forever on those foolish, stupid days of never-ending [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=452.4s)]
*  wars. We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before, and we are not going to deplete it [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  again on stupid, senseless, endless wars. World War III has never been closer than it is right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America last globalist in the deep state, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=476.0s)]
*  I am the president who delivers peace. I was the first president in decades who didn't start a war. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=482.8s)]
*  Trump in 2013 said, remember that I predicted a long time ago that Obama will attack Iran [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=488.56s)]
*  because of his inability to negotiate properly, not skilled exclamation point right there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=495.44s)]
*  Seeing if there's any other additional information to report right now as well, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=504.0s)]
*  we will keep you posted every step of the way as we get more data. But that's what we have for now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=511.2s)]
*  The United States is at war. Donald Trump did not go through the lawful process of getting an [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=516.8s)]
*  authorization by Congress, but Donald Trump has put the United States at war against Iran with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=522.32s)]
*  Israel. Trump, Netanyahu, going in alone, as far as we know, without any of America's traditional [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=529.2s)]
*  allies. It is my belief that this is not going to be ending anytime soon. We'll keep you posted [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EO6eYDZytE&t=537.04s)]
