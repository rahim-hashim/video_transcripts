Video Description: On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: Elon Musk and Donald Trump go to war—and it gets messy. Musk accuses the White House of covering up the Epstein files to protect Trump, then calls for Trump’s impeachment. Meanwhile, Trump spirals after a disastrous meeting with the German Chancellor and pushes more lies about phantom deals with China. But Democrats aren’t backing down, striking back with sharp cross-examinations during key hearings. All that and more as Ben, Brett, and Jordy break it down.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 6/5/25
**MeidasTouch:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs)
*  The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk is intensifying. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=0.0s)]
*  It is an all out war. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is calling for Donald Trump to be impeached. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=6.32s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying that Donald Trump is covering up the Epstein files because he is all over them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=9.68s)]
*  And Elon Musk said, mark this post for the future. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=16.64s)]
*  The truth will come out about Donald Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=19.6s)]
*  Elon Musk posted that the only way Donald Trump won the 2024 election was because of Elon Musk. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=21.92s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying that Trump's tariffs will cause a recession. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=28.24s)]
*  He guarantees it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  On the other hand, you have Donald Trump saying that Elon Musk suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=33.36s)]
*  Trump is saying that Elon Musk wore a Trump is always right hat. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=38.72s)]
*  And once you wear that hat, you can no longer be mean to Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=43.68s)]
*  Donald Trump says, Elon Musk has gone crazy because he's no longer in the White House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=47.68s)]
*  And Elon wishes he was there with Donald Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=53.12s)]
*  We will keep you posted on every step of this feud, how it developed, where it's going. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=55.84s)]
*  And will we ultimately start to learn more about this cesspool of corruption that's been taking place? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=61.2s)]
*  On the other hand, you had Frederick Meyers, the German Chancellor, having this press conference with Donald Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump further humiliated the United States of America. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=76.16s)]
*  Donald Trump described Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine as like two little kids who are having a fight with each other and they need to fight it out even more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=80.08s)]
*  And Trump told Frederick Meyers, who was there to try to convince Donald Trump to actually support Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=91.36s)]
*  Donald Trump was like, I told Putin, they're like little kids, you probably need to fight more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=97.28s)]
*  Just just just let them fight it out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=102.56s)]
*  And this follows Donald Trump making a post on social media saying that he spoke with Vladimir Putin and Putin said that he was going to have to respond strongly to the attack on Russia by Ukraine, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=104.56s)]
*  making it seem like Putin is somehow the victim when Putin is out there using Iranian drones every single night, Shahid drones, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=116.4s)]
*  killing innocent Ukrainians and sending ballistic missiles to attack Ukraine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Whereas Ukraine attacked Russia's strategic fleet, destroying 31% of Russia's strategic fleet that's used to kill innocent Ukrainians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=130.64s)]
*  But for Donald Trump, it's not just that he both sides it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  He basically takes Vladimir Putin's side on these issues. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=142.55999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump also begged for a call with Xi Jinping of China earlier today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  What happened was that the rare earth minerals were suspended by Xi Jinping from being sent from China to the United States. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=152.16s)]
*  Our supply chain requires rare earth minerals to build lots of things, including important technologies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=159.84s)]
*  So Donald Trump basically had to call and beg on rare earth minerals. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=166.88s)]
*  And then you had this readout from China that Donald Trump requested the call and Xi Jinping counseled Donald Trump to try to conduct himself in a way that facilitates more stability in the markets. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  The whole thing is so utterly humiliating. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=182.72s)]
*  I also don't want to lose track on some major domestic developments. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=184.88s)]
*  You have Trump ending former President Biden's executive order that directed hospitals to provide emergency abortion care to women who show up at the hospitals and are about to die. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=188.88s)]
*  Donald Trump basically says that they should die. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump had another travel ban that he implemented. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=204.0s)]
*  He said as a result of the Egyptian terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, notably Egypt was not on that list. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=208.56s)]
*  Then I want to talk about Democrats brilliant cross exam of Trump cabinet members like Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon and others will break this all down on a fact filled episode of the Minus Dutch podcast, bringing in Brett and Jordy Brothers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=216.8s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=233.2s)]
*  Well, that escalated quickly, folks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=234.4s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=235.92s)]
*  This this I think one didn't catch us by surprise in that we've been predicting this implosion to happen between Donald Trump and Elon Musk since day one. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=236.96s)]
*  Or maybe since negative day 50 or whatever it was. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=245.68s)]
*  However, the fact that it came and it came so quickly just now with the two going at each other in the ways that they are doing it as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=248.72s)]
*  Deeply personal, incredible accusations being levied on both sides here with Elon Musk going to the Epstein card and saying Donald Trump's administration is withholding the Epstein files for one reason. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=256.32s)]
*  And that is because Donald Trump is on the list. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=270.64s)]
*  That is stunning to hear from Elon Musk. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=274.24s)]
*  Absolutely stunning. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=277.04s)]
*  And I want to remind everybody here that we had Congressman Dan Goldman on the Midas Touch podcast just a few weeks ago. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that he came on the Midas Touch podcast to discuss was the fact that it certainly seemed like there was a cover up going on in Trump's Department of Justice with Pam Bondi, with Cash Patel, with Dan Bugino. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  And they were covering up these files for Donald Trump, where that's what Dan Goldman was alleging. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=296.56s)]
*  He wanted answers on that very issue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=301.36s)]
*  Now we go weeks later. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=303.84s)]
*  Now Elon Musk, who was in the room, is making those same accusations or not even accusations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=305.52s)]
*  He's making those claims that he knows that for a fact. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=310.64s)]
*  That's why you got to listen to the Midas Touch podcast, folks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  You heard it here first weeks ago. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=316.0s)]
*  Make sure you subscribe on audio and on Apple Podcasts and on Spotify. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=317.28s)]
*  But I know we've got a whole bunch to get into here today. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=321.2s)]
*  I'll toss it over to Jordy, catch up with you, Jordy, and then we got to dive in because oh my God. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=325.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm so excited for today's show. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=331.12s)]
*  Benji, I'll toss it to you in one second. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=333.28s)]
*  I mean, just Trump, Elon, this implosion that we've been predicting here on the show, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=334.88s)]
*  to see it unfold, Brett, to your point, in such a spectacular way, in such a public, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  deeply personal way too. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we knew that it was coming. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=348.55999999999995s)]
*  And to see it play out the way it's played out today, I got my popcorn ready for tonight's show, folks. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=350.23999999999995s)]
*  Benji, where are we keeping it all? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  I got to say, we all needed this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  We all deserve this after what we've been through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  We deserve this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=361.52s)]
*  Yeah, we deserve this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=362.4s)]
*  So I've seen people in the chat say, I don't know who to root for. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=363.2s)]
*  And my answer is simple. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=367.52s)]
*  Don't root for anybody. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=368.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  Don't root for Trump. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  You don't root for Musk. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  You root for the truth coming out and the cesspool of corruption that's been taking place. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Elon knows where the bodies are buried. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=377.28s)]
*  Elon was with Donald Trump during the campaigning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  Elon was with Donald Trump at all of these sensitive meetings. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  Elon was with Donald Trump in the Middle East. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  And you can tell the White House is really freaked out about this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  They canceled all of their interviews on Fox today. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=391.68s)]
*  You had Stephen Miller abruptly canceling it, and Fox tried to play it off like, oh, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=395.12s)]
*  this always happens all the time. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=399.52s)]
*  They're trying to figure out what the hell they're going to do because they know Elon [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=401.76s)]
*  knows where the bodies are buried. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  But the latest, and we'll keep giving you updates throughout the night, is Donald Trump [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=407.04s)]
*  is now determining his options about launching criminal investigations into Elon Musk, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=413.12s)]
*  thinking about deporting Elon Musk. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=418.88s)]
*  One of the things that we learned, New York Times reported earlier, Stephen Bannon, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  who has been one of the most vocal critics of Musk for months, said he is advising Donald Trump [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=426.56s)]
*  to cancel all of Musk's contracts and launch several investigations into Musk. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=431.84s)]
*  Quote, they should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=437.2s)]
*  strong belief that he is an illegal alien and he should be deported from the country immediately, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=442.0s)]
*  Bannon said. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=446.64s)]
*  Bannon further said that the Trump regime should also investigate Musk's drug use, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=447.44s)]
*  as reported by the Times, and his effort to get classified briefings on China from the Pentagon, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=451.76s)]
*  which was also reported by the Times. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=457.44s)]
*  Bannon said Musk's security clearance should be suspended during these investigations. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=459.44s)]
*  And then you have Elon Musk repeating over and over again that Donald Trump is on the Epstein [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=465.28s)]
*  list. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=470.88s)]
*  This is a Trump cover-up taking place right now before our eyes and repeating over and over and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  over again. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=478.88s)]
*  So I guess we should just go from the beginning, remind our viewers where this started. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=479.52s)]
*  Elon Musk left the White House, his term, he was based on being a kind of a special advisor, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=483.84s)]
*  his term expired by statute. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  And then Elon Musk, once he left, was very critical of Trump's disastrous budget bill. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=492.88s)]
*  So Elon came out with this statement. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=498.55999999999995s)]
*  He said, I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=504.32s)]
*  abomination. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=507.92s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=510.32s)]
*  You know it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  Musk then also posted it will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.4 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=512.16s)]
*  trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=517.76s)]
*  Then Elon Musk posted earlier this morning, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=524.24s)]
*  Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=529.2s)]
*  Such ingratitude is what he wrote. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk stopped following Stephen Miller. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=537.2s)]
*  By the way, Musk employs Stephen Miller's wife. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=540.72s)]
*  We're not sure what the status is of that right now. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=544.88s)]
*  Elon Musk unfollowed Charlie Kirk. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=547.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was relatively silent on Elon Musk. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=551.6s)]
*  Then during the Oval Office press conference with Frederick Mayors, the Germany Chancellor, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=555.76s)]
*  Donald Trump started talking about Elon Musk. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=562.8s)]
*  He goes, I think Elon misses the place. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=565.6s)]
*  He's not the first. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=568.0s)]
*  I think he has Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=569.52s)]
*  Let's play that clip, Trump on Musk. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=571.52s)]
*  My administration and they love us. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=574.08s)]
*  And then at some point they miss it so badly. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=578.56s)]
*  And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=581.6s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=586.16s)]
*  It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=587.12s)]
*  I guess they call it, but we have it with us too. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=588.96s)]
*  They leave and they wake up in the morning and the glamour is gone. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  The whole world is different and they become hostile. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=597.04s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=600.72s)]
*  Someday you'll write a book about it and you'll let us know. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=601.84s)]
*  Reminder, you have Germany's Chancellor, the leader of Germany, sitting right next to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=605.28s)]
*  Donald Trump while he's saying these things. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=609.28s)]
*  Then Donald Trump says that Musk wore the hat. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=611.12s)]
*  He wore a hat that said Trump is always right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=614.16s)]
*  Once you wear the hat, you can't criticize me, he says. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=616.72s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=639.28s)]
*  The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=652.64s)]
*  is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=657.36s)]
*  I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it and that kind of exposes that there were all these [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  conflicts of interest, which we of course talked about in Doge to begin with, and that Doge was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=666.96s)]
*  all a fraud and that Doge was all a scam. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=671.36s)]
*  So in trying to attack Elon, Donald Trump makes basically a very incriminating admission right [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=673.44s)]
*  there. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=679.12s)]
*  And then Trump posts, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  Elon was wearing thin. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=680.64s)]
*  I asked him to leave. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=682.24s)]
*  I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=683.44s)]
*  that he knew for months I was going to do, and he just went crazy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=689.2s)]
*  So then Elon Musk responds, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=693.36s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=695.28s)]
*  At real, Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=698.16s)]
*  That's the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=703.84s)]
*  Mark this post for the future. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=706.72s)]
*  The truth will come out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=708.72s)]
*  And then Elon Musk also posts, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  In light of the president's statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=712.4s)]
*  SpaceX will be decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  and that provides supplies to the International Space Station. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=721.28s)]
*  So in other words, he's saying good luck with NASA, good luck with any space program, Donald. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=724.48s)]
*  And then Elon Musk says that Donald Trump's tariffs are going to cause us to have a recession [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=728.96s)]
*  the second half of the year. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=734.88s)]
*  So I think that kind of brings us relatively current to where we are. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=738.56s)]
*  The Tesla stock plummeted by almost 20% as a result of this attack. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=743.12s)]
*  Notably, when I was looking at Donald Trump's- [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  Jack, is it normal for a stock to be tied to how Matt, a president, gets at an individual? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=752.4799999999999s)]
*  I think in Russia, and I think in places where you have- [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=758.4799999999999s)]
*  So stocks are supposed to work, folks? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=761.52s)]
*  I always thought it had to do with profit and EBITDA and revenue and projects. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=763.92s)]
*  It's directly tied to your relationship with the president or your relationship. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=767.2s)]
*  Interesting. I had to chat. I didn't know this. I'm learning. I'm learning about the markets. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=770.8s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump was getting ratioed on his own social media, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=774.4s)]
*  like cult follower thing that he has there on what he calls truth social. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=778.32s)]
*  And for the non-online people, that means you're getting more comments, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=782.72s)]
*  negative for the most part, than you are, you know, likes on your post for the non-online folks out there. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=786.88s)]
*  And so the Trump supporters were even saying, stop attacking Elon. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=793.04s)]
*  Elon's right. You need to stop attacking him. Why are you doing this in public? This is embarrassing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=796.72s)]
*  You know, and there were thousands, tens of thousands of messages like that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=802.4s)]
*  I found that interesting that that was on truth social, that he was getting those comments there, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  because if you saw it on X, it'd be like, okay, yeah, well, Elon controls X. That's his platform. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=811.52s)]
*  Those could be bots, whatever. But you're seeing it up to your appointment on Donald Trump's website [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=815.2s)]
*  right there, his own followers. Like, those are the real sycophants right there. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=819.12s)]
*  You have a truth social account? You are, you are mega. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=822.32s)]
*  Thanks. Here's the thing. You defending Elon. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=825.6s)]
*  These MAGA followers, they position these two individuals, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  as these two infallible people who could do no wrong. And that, I guess, could work when [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=834.0s)]
*  they're on the same side, pushing the same agenda. But this is why that this whole MAGA [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  movement and authoritarianism in general requires everybody to toe the line, requires everybody [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=844.0s)]
*  to be doing the same thing and not speak out against the leader. Because the second you do, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  the house of cards crumbles. And the fact that all of these MAGA supporters have invested their [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=854.64s)]
*  entire, like, worldview in these two people. And now that these two people are at odds with one [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=859.84s)]
*  another, it's almost like, you know, they're divorced. You got to pick a side. Whose side [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=865.68s)]
*  are you going to pick? Because they're on very opposite sides right here. You can't agree with [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=870.24s)]
*  both. And so you just see whether it's Fox or whether it's truth social commenters, you see [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=874.48s)]
*  people just then on the on the right, these MAGA people panic, then unable to figure out, like, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=879.68s)]
*  what do I do here? We need mommy and daddy to stop fighting. This is this isn't okay. Please stop [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=883.92s)]
*  fighting anything but this. It's like their whole worldview is crumbling before them as we watch. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=888.88s)]
*  And look, they've already gone from zero to 100 in under a second, basically, right? Like, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=894.0s)]
*  they're, you know, Trump's like, you don't got the cards, you don't got the cards, by the way, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=900.3199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine had the cards, Donald Trump didn't have the cards. But in the fight, we'll talk more about [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=904.4s)]
*  Ukraine's brilliant military strategy and taking out 30 to 40% of Russia's strategic fleet by [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=910.16s)]
*  sending drones deep into Russia. It was just a one of the most masterful war strategies ever. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=918.88s)]
*  But in terms of the cards, like, if you were to say, like, what's the biggest card that Trump has [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=926.4s)]
*  against Elon and Elon has against Trump? I think Elon, by the way, is still holding some of his [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  cards. But for Trump, it's basically cancel Elon's government contracts, right? Trump went there, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=936.16s)]
*  like, right away, try to deport Elon and say that he was here illegally, and get rid of Elon from [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=941.12s)]
*  the country. They're going right there right away. Say that Elon's a criminal for going after [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=947.36s)]
*  classified information at the Pentagon. They're already right there right away. And then in terms [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  of Elon to Trump, Elon saying you would not have won the election if it wasn't for me. And by the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=958.24s)]
*  way, I know for a fact that the reason the Epstein files aren't being released is because you are all [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=964.32s)]
*  over them. And then Elon consistently, even as of this recording, right, taunting Donald Trump over [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  and over again with Epstein videos, Epstein images, you know, saying Trump was with Epstein. Trump said [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  that Epstein likes young women who, and Epstein's a great guy who likes young women. I mean, post [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=984.32s)]
*  after post like this. And it's just interesting too, because, and this is what our editor in chief, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=990.48s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski said, it seemed kind of weird when you had a Cash Patel, who's the current director [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=994.64s)]
*  of the FBI, and Dan Bongino, who's the number two at the FBI, deputy FBI director. These were the two [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  right-wing podcasters who were out there spreading a ton of Jeffrey Epstein stuff. Like, they were the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  ones, you know, this needs to be released, get it out there. It's interesting that Donald Trump made [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1012.96s)]
*  those two people the heads of the FBI. And then in their interview with Fox and Maria Bartiroma, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1018.24s)]
*  they now say the opposite things that they were saying when they were right-wing podcasters. Like [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1024.64s)]
*  here, Cash Patel and Dan Bongino said, yes, this was from May 18th. They said, yeah, Epstein killed [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1030.08s)]
*  himself. Here, let's play this clip. You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. People don't [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1035.44s)]
*  believe it. Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has worked [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1042.0s)]
*  as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1048.64s)]
*  Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1052.48s)]
*  and that's what that was. He killed himself. Again, you want me to get... I've seen the whole file. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1057.52s)]
*  He killed himself. I know it's hard work. I've seen the whole file. I've seen the whole file. This was [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1064.48s)]
*  May 28, 2025, when Cash Patel was asked, so why aren't you releasing these files? I mean, you said [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1070.16s)]

*  right-wing MAGA influencers a binder that they were holding up, and they were pretending it was [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1081.84s)]
*  the Epstein files when it was actually Epstein's, like, Rolodex of phone numbers, which by the way, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump's number was on that, and lots of Trump-associated numbers were on that. But this [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1092.24s)]
*  is what Patel said on the Epstein files on May 28, 2025. Let's play it. The other thing on the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1096.72s)]
*  internet is the Epstein files. What's the answer to that? The answer to that is the same as [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1102.0s)]
*  everything else. I'm not going to withhold information from the American public ever, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1108.88s)]
*  but I'm also not going to rush to get it out there in a format in which they can't rely on it. So on [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  the Epstein matter or any other matters, we are diligently working on that, and it takes time to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1120.24s)]
*  go through years of investigations, years of political maneuvering, and years of cover-up [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1126.08s)]
*  to get the American people what they deserve. And that's what I'm going to give them on everything. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's what you're going to do. And by the way, remember the bromance between Musk [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1136.08s)]
*  and Donald Trump when Elon Musk would show up at cabinet meetings and basically be the co-leader [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1141.9199999999998s)]
*  of these cabinet meetings wearing two hats at once, like, cartoonishly weird. He'd wear, like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1148.08s)]
*  two Gulf of America hats over dark MAGA hat here. Play this clip. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1154.88s)]
*  Great job, Kelly. Thank you very much. Elon, I love the double hat, but is he all I want to do? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1158.72s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, they say I wear a lot of hats. Even my hat has a hat. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1166.88s)]
*  And then you had MAGA Mike in both of his personalities. You have [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1177.2800000000002s)]
*  Botox MAGA Mike, and then you have actual MAGA Mike. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1181.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's got the Botox MAGA Mike is, you know, is for those of you who don't know how to show [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1184.96s)]
*  a clip where MAGA Mike's face just looks like it looks like a bad, it looks like the first [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1193.44s)]
*  generation of AI creations of people. Yeah, like perhaps one of Elon's robotic creations. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1200.8s)]
*  Exactly. So here you have MAGA Mike Johnson back in March when they were kind of passing the first [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1206.96s)]
*  kind of steps to this disastrous budget bill, saying that, look, the reason that we know this [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  budget bill is going to be great. He goes, Elon's a game changer. He's got these algorithms that are [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1219.68s)]
*  so brilliant and they figured it all out. And that's why we're going to make a great budget bill [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1225.52s)]
*  right now. Because of Elon, take a look at Botox MAGA Mike. Well, here's what we try to do. We [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1229.68s)]
*  wanted to pass a resolution that would effectively free spending so that the administration can [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1234.72s)]
*  continue its incredible work through Doge and through the other efforts of the administration [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1239.76s)]
*  to go in and root out the fraud, waste and abuse that we've been trying to target in Congress for [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1244.4s)]
*  decades. But we haven't been able to get to it because we didn't have the algorithms that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1249.3600000000001s)]
*  Elon has. We didn't have the access to all the data and the funding. And so now the game has [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1254.0s)]
*  changed. So we needed. Well, the game has changed. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Icomically bad Botox. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1258.72s)]
*  I have to comment on it. I think I blacked that out of my mind when we first played it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1266.96s)]
*  For the audio listeners, it's just his lips moving. It's just his lips and his eyeballs moving. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1270.64s)]
*  It's like a chipmunk called in some nuts for the winter. That is Naked RNC bad Botox vibes. Sheesh. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1275.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Nick Jr. face here. Remember that? Yeah, of course. Yeah, but I don't know how that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1283.04s)]
*  ties into the vote. OK, the game. The game has changed. We now have Elon Musk calling for Donald [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1288.4s)]
*  Trump to be impeached and replaced by J.D. Vance. He repost this from Ian Miles Chung, who says [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1295.76s)]
*  Trump should be impeached and J.D. Vance should replace him. And Elon Musk goes, yes, yes, that's [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  what should go down. So that's where we are right now. I'm sure this is going to escalate even [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1308.4s)]
*  further. What I hope happens, though, out of this is I want to get to the bottom, as I call it, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1315.04s)]
*  the cesspool of corruption. What was going down in the Middle East? Elon Musk knows. What was going [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1322.3999999999999s)]
*  down in the Oval? Elon Musk knows. What was going on with the 2024 election and the dirty dealings [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1328.0s)]
*  that Musk was involved in and paying off people and Elon Musk's overall involvement [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1335.28s)]
*  that had violated campaign finance laws? Musk knows all this stuff. So if Trump goes for the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1344.72s)]
*  deportation criminal investigation mode, which it seems that's where this is heading, you know, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1351.2s)]
*  Musk is going to respond with the receipts for injury. Yeah, maybe come to the Midasuch podcast [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1356.56s)]
*  and just air it all out. You know, I'm sure our listeners and everybody would like to would like [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  to know about everything that's been going on over there. Absolutely. I do the Musk interview and say [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  that you should just yeah, you just go Musk. All right. Listen, we got our differences. We don't [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  really like you at all. However, just just talk and we'll hopefully get some good stuff. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  We will increase the speed by like four. We will cut off the arms and the eyes. We'll make it [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1382.48s)]
*  crisper. I'm not sure this is the best way to record this. We're editing the footage. Then [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1388.48s)]
*  Donald Trump may sue and say it causes him so much mental and emotional stress like his lawsuit [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  against us. Sixty minutes on CBS. The difference there, though, Ben is we wouldn't cave like those [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1398.4s)]
*  cowards did. That's that's that's right. Well, let's think about how quickly this is all escalated. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1403.1200000000001s)]
*  That last what is last week, like days ago, you had Musk inside the Oval Office with Donald Trump [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1407.92s)]
*  handing him the key to the White House. They changed the locks. The key to the White House, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1413.68s)]
*  right. And and and, you know, heaping praise on each other. And even as we heard that that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1419.92s)]
*  praise was happening, what were the reports behind the scenes? What were sources telling us? What [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1424.8s)]
*  were people saying that these two people really hate each other, that they really despise each [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  other and that this bill was causing the latest rift? And then we saw there was that moment, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  which I think was the was the straw that broke the camel's back, which was when Donald Trump [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  decided to toss Elon Musk's handpicked guy for NASA. Once Donald Trump removed Elon Musk's NASA [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1441.2s)]
*  pick, who, by the way, probably would have gotten through with like 70 plus votes per what a lot of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1448.48s)]
*  members of Congress, you know, in the U.S. Senator saying once he did that, that was it for Musk. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1453.68s)]
*  He's like, screw this guy. And by the way, I think that was an open attack by Donald Trump on Elon [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1458.88s)]
*  Musk. He knew that this guy had given money to Democrats in the past. That was never a secret [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1464.48s)]
*  at all. He just came up with an excuse to get rid of this guy as a slight to Musk purposely to [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1468.96s)]
*  basically hit Musk and then Musk hit back. And now it's just been this back and forth of the biggest [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1474.5600000000002s)]
*  narcissists on the planet, each trying to make their case and ramping this thing up by the minute, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1479.76s)]
*  trying to follow this thing today. It was just like, holy crap, holy crap. And like the Epstein [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1487.44s)]
*  tweet when that one came out, I was like, I had to go straight to the account, you know, make sure [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1491.6s)]
*  this is a real tweet that came from Elon Musk's account. I could not believe it. And the fact that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1497.44s)]
*  he wrote, you know, just wait for the next year to drop, you know, watch the space basically. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1503.52s)]
*  I mean, it's truly stunning stuff coming from the guy who has so buddied up with Donald Trump over [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1508.4s)]
*  these past few months. Absolutely. And look, there's no coming back from this. Like you're [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1513.44s)]
*  going to drop the Epstein tweet. Like that's it. Donald Trump's never going to let him back in his [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1518.16s)]
*  good graces. And so now this MAGA community who has been both glazing Elon Musk and glazing Donald [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1521.92s)]
*  Trump nonstop, they're going to have to decide now, oh, who do I want to continue? Am I team Elon? Am [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1528.88s)]
*  I team Trump? And it's just such a bizarre way to look at the world and America in this country and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1535.84s)]
*  politics in this country. It's why we never, you know, we don't chase people or politicians, right? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1542.32s)]
*  We lead with our values here and our beliefs. And that's our guiding principle in North Star, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1548.08s)]
*  because we can never succumb to like, we know what our values here at the network. But now if you're [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1553.04s)]
*  in this MAGA court, right, now you have to decide because you put people over the country. You put [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1557.36s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk over everyone in this country. And now you have to decide, are you going [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1563.84s)]
*  to live with mom or are you going to go live with daddy? It's up to you. Who, Gutfeld, who are you [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1568.6399999999999s)]
*  going to go live with, buddy? Who are you going to go live with? Waters, who are you living with? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1572.56s)]
*  Well, to be clear, that's how they're talking about it on Fox and on the right wing. Mommy or [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  daddy, you know, mommy and daddy are fighting. That's literally what they're saying on Fox. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1580.3999999999999s)]
*  I'll do a whole other take on what Fox is doing, but they're literally saying mommy and daddy are [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1585.12s)]
*  in a fight. And then you have Jesse Waters basically saying, this is what dudes do, man. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1589.76s)]
*  Like, you know, like you could be best friends and you sleep with each other's girlfriends and then [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1595.28s)]
*  you just bro it out the next day. And people are like, that's literally what Jesse Waters said [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1599.84s)]
*  on his show. I said I wasn't going to play. Just so people know that when I say it, like, that's [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1605.2s)]
*  actually what happened. Let me just show you, and then I'll stop showing Fox clips. This is what [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1609.76s)]
*  Jesse Waters said. Like, dude, just sleep with each other's wives and girlfriends or whatever. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1613.92s)]
*  And then just then just fist bump. That's what we do. That's what men do. That's what guys do. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1618.64s)]
*  Here, play. I wonder if this means Harold's friends will start buying Teslas again. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1623.5200000000002s)]
*  They never stopped. Maybe Trump will torch the one that Musk gave him. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1628.16s)]
*  Sometimes when you're angry, you say things you don't mean. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1633.2s)]
*  Greg knocked my hair last week and I said he's on the Epstein list. Yeah, you did. No, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1636.16s)]
*  I didn't mean that. I made it up. How did you know, though? How did Musk know? No one knows [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1640.48s)]
*  what the list is. He didn't know. But sometimes guys fight. Guys sometimes will punch you in the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1646.64s)]
*  face and the next night you're having a beer. Sleep with your girlfriend and you patch things up. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1651.76s)]
*  Really? Not your wife? Your girlfriend. No one slept with my girlfriend. Let's put it that way. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1656.8000000000002s)]
*  That's also one of the mechanisms that Trump, that Fox uses when it comes to their coverage, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1666.16s)]
*  to kind of make everything not serious, right? Everything's a joke. Everything is what it is. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think we have gut felt after that also. I said I wasn't going to play it, but play the clip. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1677.0400000000002s)]
*  It's too good. Well, I think what you're seeing is a battle between the purist and the pragmatist. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1683.44s)]
*  I don't like it. I want it to stop. I want to tell them if they're both watching, knock it off. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1689.2s)]
*  We're done with this. This is an incredible moment for our country. It's awake. It's optimistic. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1696.24s)]
*  It's on board with the golden age. Don't sabotage it with the self-inflicted feud. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1702.72s)]
*  Don't let the Dems get back up from the floor where they belong. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1710.16s)]
*  It's why our country is a laughing stock to the rest of the world. Let me think about it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  You have Frederick Mayors, the new chancellor of Germany, on a very serious visit to go to the [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1722.08s)]
*  Oval Office to deliver an important message on behalf of the European Union and Ukraine after a [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1727.76s)]
*  stunning military successful operation by Ukraine against Russia, with Ukraine having momentum. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1733.44s)]
*  This is supposed to be a serious conversation about real geopolitical structures and how to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1740.32s)]
*  combat Russia. And then you have this very serious fight between Trump and basically someone as a [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1748.72s)]
*  co-president. And then you have Fox, which is state regime media, saying, knock it off, knock [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1754.64s)]
*  it off. And it's why the world looks at the United States as a weirder version of North Korea right [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1760.24s)]
*  now. Look, Donald Trump can't run Bedminster. The health inspectors that just went to Bedminster [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1765.3600000000001s)]
*  just gave Bedminster a 32 out of 100, the lowest score. They found 18 separate health violations. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1774.64s)]
*  Literally the lowest score in the entire county. The lowest score you can get. He can't run [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1783.2s)]
*  Bedminster. And just think about the people who go there and pay millions of dollars for their access, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  who eat this disgusting food there and are all grossed out by it. He can't run anything. Someone [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  who's bankrupted everything in his life. This guy's never run, he doesn't run things good. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1800.32s)]
*  And then you see why. You see the behavior. You see it all falling apart right now. Anyway, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1805.8400000000001s)]
*  that was about five minutes before I was supposed to call the ad break five minutes ago, but we had [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1810.72s)]

*  with this one question. Does Donald Trump keep or get rid of his Tesla thoughts, questions, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1844.08s)]
*  comments, concerns? I don't know. I'll let everybody ponder over this quick ad break. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1850.0s)]
*  We'll be right back after this. As the weather warms up, I've been rethinking my skincare routine, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1853.6s)]
*  especially because I used to rely on retinol, but retinol can make your skin more sensitive to the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1860.96s)]
*  sun, which is not ideal for summer. That's why I've switched to OneSkin's OS One Face, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1865.12s)]
*  and I'm seriously impressed. OS One Face boosts collagen production like retinol without the sun [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  sensitivity. And unlike retinol, which could actually disrupt your skin barrier, OS One [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1875.9199999999998s)]
*  strengthens it, helping your skin become more resilient to the heat, sun, and pollution. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1881.12s)]
*  Here's what makes it different. OneSkin's patented OS One Peptide is the first ingredient [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1886.7199999999998s)]
*  scientifically proven to reverse your skin's biological age by reducing senescent cells, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1892.0s)]
*  the root cause of skin aging. Instead of irritating your skin, it helps it look, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1897.76s)]
*  feel, and act younger. Personally, I've been using it on my face, and what I love most [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1902.56s)]
*  is how smooth and healthy my skin feels. It's become a staple in my routine, absolutely essential. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1907.12s)]
*  OneSkin is the world's first skin longevity company. By focusing on the cellular aspects [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1913.6s)]
*  of aging, OneSkin keeps your skin looking and acting younger for longer. For a limited time, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1917.92s)]

*  feeling fresh after drinks with friends, it's with pre-alcohol. Zbiotic's pre-alcohol probiotic [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1946.72s)]
*  drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. It was invented by PhD scientists to [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1952.56s)]
*  tackle rough mornings after drinking. Now here's how it works. When you drink, alcohol gets [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1957.92s)]
*  converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. Now it's a buildup of this byproduct, not dehydration, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1962.56s)]
*  that's to blame for rough days after drinking. Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1969.28s)]
*  byproduct down. Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, drink responsibly, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1975.04s)]
*  and you'll feel your best tomorrow. Now every time I've had pre-alcohol before drinks, I notice a [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1981.44s)]
*  difference the next day. Now even after a night out, I can confidently plan on just waking up and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1987.44s)]
*  feeling my best the next day without worrying. Look, I won't lie, I was a bit on the fence about [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1992.0s)]
*  pre-alcohol initially, but then while hanging out with some friends at our bar, I gave it a shot, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  and believe me, it's the real deal. So I first gave pre-alcohol a try when I was at a wedding, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2001.52s)]
*  I drank it before my first espresso martini, and you wouldn't believe how on top of my game I felt [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2007.04s)]
*  the next morning. Now summer's here, which means more opportunities to celebrate the warm weather. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2011.84s)]
*  Before that backyard barbecue brew, or your glass of pino watching the sunset at a beach or a cocktail [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2017.52s)]
*  by the campfire, don't forget your Z-biotics pre-alcohol. Drink one before drinking, and wake [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2024.32s)]

*  Germany's Chancellor Frederick Meyers and Donald Trump in the Oval Office. The German Chancellor [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2091.12s)]
*  was there specifically on the heels of Ukraine's successful counterattack against Russia where [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2096.48s)]
*  Ukraine snuck in all of these kind of cargo trucks that were holding all of these drones. They hired [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  Russian truck drivers who believed they were moving mobile homes pretty close to various [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2114.08s)]
*  Russian military bases. By the way, Ukraine was working on this for over a year. Remotely, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2120.72s)]
*  all of a sudden, the hatches open on the cargo and then the drones get released. Then the drones [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2128.16s)]
*  eliminated a huge amount of Russia's air force. Just wiped them out, 31%, 35% of the strategic [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2134.24s)]
*  fleet. I think it was actually 41 planes, including those with nuclear capabilities. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2143.36s)]
*  There's momentum. Zelensky had the cards. That's what the purpose of this was. Germany just got [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2149.92s)]
*  a new chancellor in the recent elections who formed a government. He's there. With that as [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2155.6800000000003s)]
*  background, let's talk about what Trump said to him. Trump had a call with Putin yesterday. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2162.8s)]
*  Then Trump posted about his call with Putin. He described it as a good call. It was a very good [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2168.08s)]
*  call with Putin. Then when he described what made it a good conversation, he says, it's not a [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2172.48s)]
*  conversation that will lead to immediate peace. Putin did say and very strongly that he will have [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2178.08s)]
*  to respond to the recent attacks on the airfields. We also discussed Iran and the fact that time is [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2182.96s)]
*  running out on Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons. I stated to President Putin [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2189.12s)]
*  that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Iran is allied with Putin's Russia. The Shahi drones that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2194.0s)]
*  are attacking Ukraine are made in Iran that are killing the innocent Ukrainians. Putin is not going [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2201.36s)]
*  to tell Iran to enter into a nuclear deal. Notice Trump doesn't have any allies the way Obama did [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2208.88s)]
*  to try to deal with Iran. Trump's deal with Iran is way weaker than Obama's that Donald Trump [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2216.0s)]
*  pulled the United States out of during his first term. It has much weaker enforcement mechanisms. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2222.08s)]
*  Iran's rejecting Trump's deal because they just view Trump as weak. Why would we do any deal with [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2227.12s)]
*  you? You don't negotiate in good faith. Iran's turning it down. Trump runs to Putin on Iran [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  and then also says it was a good phone call because Putin says he's going to keep attacking [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2239.12s)]
*  Ukraine. Why is that a good phone call? You promised there would be peace in 24 hours. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2244.16s)]
*  That was your campaign promise, which you failed to do. I guess now a good call means more attacks [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2248.7999999999997s)]
*  on Ukraine. The hell are you talking about? Here's how Donald Trump compares the war in Ukraine [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2254.56s)]
*  to children fighting. This is what he said he told Putin. Here, play this clip. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2260.4s)]
*  But sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other and they're [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2264.72s)]
*  fighting in a park. You try and pull them apart. They don't want to be pulled. Sometimes you're [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2269.84s)]
*  better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart. I gave that analogy to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2275.6s)]
*  Putin yesterday. I said, President, maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2283.44s)]
*  lot because both sides are suffering. What the hell is he talking about? It's like kids fighting [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2289.68s)]
*  in a park. That's what he told Putin and that's what he's saying in front of Germany. I mean, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2295.44s)]
*  it's so embarrassing. I still rank the biggest embarrassments of those visits. Number one being [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2301.12s)]
*  the Zelensky meeting. Number two being Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2306.72s)]
*  This was a close second. Can I just say the weirdness, pause for a second, that this always [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  happens when he brings in a world leader into the Oval Office and then just spirals out of control. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2322.3999999999996s)]
*  Even if it has nothing to do with the person who's in the Oval Office and the conversation [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2328.08s)]
*  should have nothing to do with anything else but the conversations they're having, somehow he goes [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2332.3999999999996s)]
*  on all these tensions that it ends up about Elon Musk or it ends up with this crazy Putin. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2336.64s)]
*  It's just bizarro land that this happens every time. Let's just say you get asked the question [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2342.16s)]
*  about Putin. How do you answer this question? There's really only one way to answer the question [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2348.72s)]
*  wrong if you're the president and he answered it, the worst way to possibly answer the question. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2355.44s)]
*  Like all you have to do is saying, look, a lot of what we say in these communications, we're not [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2359.8399999999997s)]
*  going to disclose. We're here having very productive conversations with the chancellor of Germany. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2364.64s)]
*  We greatly appreciate his insight and perspective into the realities that are facing a very complex [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2370.3199999999997s)]
*  world right now. We're going to have further discussions and again, we're grateful for [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2377.68s)]
*  this visit. The United States and Germany have had a close bond over the last several decades and we [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2383.68s)]
*  intend to keep it. Literally, you just do some version of what I said and you answer that with [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2390.08s)]
*  every question. That's how these things happen in other countries. Not this. This is what Donald [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump says on what Putin told him. This is what Donald Trump says in front of Germany's chancellor. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2400.64s)]
*  Here, play this clip. There's some additional fighting that's going to go on. He attacked and [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2408.24s)]
*  they attacked pretty harshly. They went deep into Russia and he actually told me, I mean, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2415.28s)]
*  I made it very clear. He said, we have no choice but to attack based on that and [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2422.8s)]
*  it's probably not going to be pretty. Again, how do you answer that question so pitiful, so weak? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2429.1200000000003s)]
*  Zelensky has agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. He said it over and over again. Russia has not [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2438.4s)]
*  agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. Russia continues to kill innocent Ukrainians every [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2444.08s)]
*  single night. Hundreds of ballistic missiles, tens of thousands of drones, over and over again. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  Ukraine needs to defend itself. That's the reality. So no, Donald, you don't need to encourage [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2455.7599999999998s)]
*  Russia to fight more when Russia was the one who unlawfully invaded. Again, when you see that, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2461.68s)]
*  it's a step even worse than weakness. It's weakness and idiocracy combined in one. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2468.64s)]
*  And then again, you have Friedrich Merz, again, being very diplomatic as you would normally be [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2474.96s)]
*  in something like this. And Friedrich Merz is talking about how tomorrow, how on June 6th, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2481.44s)]
*  is the anniversary of D-Day. And the connection Friedrich Merz is trying to say is that [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2488.08s)]
*  we need to stop Putin, who's ravaged the world and Russia the way Hitler did that to Germany. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  And Donald Trump hears Friedrich Merz saying that, and he goes, that was not a very good day for you, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2503.3599999999997s)]
*  D-Day. It's not a good day for you. Just how offensive can you be here? Play this clip. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2511.2s)]
*  June 6th, tomorrow, this is D-Day anniversary when the Americans once ended a war in Europe. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think this is in your hand in specific, in ours. That was not a pleasant day for you? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2528.32s)]
*  No, that was not a pleasant. Well, in the long run, Mr. President, this was the liberation of [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2534.0s)]
*  my country from Nazi dictatorship. And we know what we owe you. But this is the reason why I'm [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2539.92s)]
*  saying that America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2547.12s)]
*  this war. So let's talk about what we can do jointly. And we are ready to do what we can. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2554.48s)]
*  And you know that we gave support to Ukraine and that we are looking for more pressure on Russia. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2559.68s)]
*  The European Union did. And we should talk about that. We will. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2565.6s)]
*  Brett and Jory, how do you entertain this? I can't even call him a person, but Donald Trump, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2569.44s)]
*  his brain is like, I'm just his brain is mush. Like he slouched over, he's looking down, his like [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2579.04s)]
*  hands are being all erratic. And we're like, y'all are just okay with this maniac just sitting, not [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2585.04s)]
*  you guys, not the Midas Mighty, not everyone listening here, but like to the reporters out [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2591.2s)]
*  there that want to go and talk about, you know, president's competencies. How about you look just [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2595.2s)]
*  straight ahead and see that a guy that is clearly very unwell, and I'm not giving him an out, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2601.6s)]
*  but I'm just trying to hold him account. This guy has the nuclear codes and his brain is mush. Brett. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2607.6s)]
*  I will say it was very peculiar that he basically went away to golf over the weekend, was not, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2614.16s)]
*  was then not seen until like yesterday, basically. And we just went radio silent, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2618.64s)]
*  very atypical for him. And when he first resurfaced, it wasn't in a live in front of the [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2624.32s)]
*  press setting like it normally is. It was a prerecorded, like him signing a new travel ban [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2629.6000000000004s)]
*  and his eyes looked puffy and he looked horrible. Like it just, it's just very atypical is all I'm [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2634.8s)]
*  going to say, not to get too conspiratorial about why he was maybe just out of the public eye [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2639.84s)]
*  mysteriously for like three or four days, just very odd in the, in the Trump world, I will say. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2644.4s)]
*  I do want to highlight the fact that we currently have reporters on the ground in Ukraine doing some [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2650.32s)]
*  incredible work. And so I want to give a shout out, you know, to Ken Harbaugh, Ken Harbaugh, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2655.6000000000004s)]
*  who is here with the Midas Touch Network. I know many of you have seen the Ken Harbaugh show, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2660.32s)]
*  which airs here most nights of the week and follow that podcast and have followed his [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2664.0800000000004s)]
*  YouTube channel, Valor Media Network. Just fantastic job. And he's in Ukraine right now [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2668.8s)]
*  with the Ukrainian military. I'm not going to give away his exact, you know, the exact [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2675.76s)]
*  places that he is, but I can tell you that this footage that he just sent me, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2679.68s)]
*  it's from the aftermath of a drone attack on Odessa. And I just think the footage that he's [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2683.36s)]
*  getting is really breathtaking. And when you see the scale of these drone attacks and what it [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2687.92s)]
*  actually looks like from somebody on the ground, you know, I think it, people aren't seeing it [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  enough. I think in my opinion, like the realities of the horrors of what's going on. So I want to [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2696.8s)]
*  share with you this clip from Ken Harbaugh and thank Ken and thank Valor Media and everybody [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2701.36s)]
*  over there, all the brave journalists who are on the ground there and all the Ukrainians and [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2707.6800000000003s)]
*  send them, you know, our love and our support and our strength here at the Midas Touch Network. But [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2712.08s)]
*  take a look at this exclusive clip from Midas Touch Network. It's Ken Harbaugh with the Midas [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2716.7200000000003s)]
*  Touch and Valor Media Networks here in a suburban neighborhood in Odessa, Ukraine. Nothing of [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2720.1600000000003s)]
*  military significance anywhere around here. Families already recovering from a Shahed strike [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2726.96s)]
*  last night. Putin is on a rampage after Zelensky humiliated him and his military in that massive [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2732.16s)]
*  Ukrainian drone strike, taking out strategic targets deep inside Russia. Putin's response, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2740.96s)]
*  attacking civilians. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2746.56s)]
*  Okay, time to go, sir. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2756.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's every night. And there's some other footage that we really can't even show and [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2768.88s)]
*  disclose because of operational security of the potential ways in which the threats are being or [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2773.52s)]
*  attempting to be neutralized. And I'll just, I'll just leave it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2782.4s)]
*  There's basically a strict approval process and in terms of, you know, what we can and what we [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2785.52s)]
*  can't post because of the seriousness, the sensitivities and the natures of things on the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2788.96s)]
*  ground. But, you know, I also want to let everybody out there know, you know, we're this, you know, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2792.8s)]
*  independent network over here. We're doing this coverage. It's all thanks to you. And so, you know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2796.8s)]
*  shout out to Ken, Valor Media, and to all of you who support us and make coverage like that possible [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2802.32s)]
*  and bring those images to us here in the United States so that people could see what's really [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2808.0s)]
*  going on. And I think you're really, it's a reality check, right? Because we're watching this clown [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2812.88s)]
*  show, we're watching Musk and Trump vicar, we're watching Trump speak about his deranged conversation [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2817.52s)]
*  he had with Putin, and it's all just so embarrassing. And sometimes you just need to step back, watch [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2823.04s)]
*  stuff like that, and just remind yourself there are lives on the line here. And that's why, you [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2827.12s)]
*  know, we're fighting so hard for these values every single day, because we cannot let this go on. And [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2831.76s)]
*  we got to speak out. And that's what we promise to do here. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  When we come back, I want to talk about what's been going on in Congress. I mean, some incredible [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2840.72s)]
*  cross examinations by Democrats of these Trump cabinet members and other Republican witnesses [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2848.08s)]
*  really exposing the dangerous idiocracy that exists. And then I want to just talk about a few [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2855.12s)]
*  other developments with whether it's Trump seeking to remove the Columbia's being an accredited school [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2861.6s)]
*  after Columbia really kind of kissed the ring, Trump's taking away their being becoming an [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2869.44s)]
*  accredited university. You have Donald Trump's actions, removing or reversing former President [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2875.36s)]
*  Biden's executive order requiring hospitals to provide emergency health care in the form of [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2882.7200000000003s)]

*  the Egyptian national who engaged in the terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2895.04s)]
*  but Egypt isn't on the list because Trump says he likes Egypt. So he's not going to put Egypt [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2900.4s)]
*  on that list and much more. So let's take our last quick break of the show. Reminder, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=2906.2400000000002s)]

*  a good post right there. By the way, we should mention this as well before moving on to other [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3256.32s)]

*  I think Democrats were doing a really good job exposing how just disastrous and cartoonishly evil [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3308.88s)]
*  and dumb these Trump cabinet members are. I want to show you first Democratic Congresswoman Dean, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3318.48s)]
*  her questioning to Howard Lutnick, asking, I know you are very upset about this concept that [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3326.0800000000004s)]
*  America has a deficit with a lot of countries. Do you remember though, when America actually had [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3333.44s)]
*  a surplus as against the rest of the world, did you remember what that time was? Here, play this [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3340.1600000000003s)]
*  clue. For me, I have a pretty large trade deficit with my local grocer or my hairdresser. It's a [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3346.4s)]
*  good thing. It means I have money enough to get my hair done once in a while and to keep food on the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3354.64s)]
*  table. It tells nothing about my overall financial position. Do you know when this country actually [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3359.36s)]
*  had a trade surplus, Secretary? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3367.52s)]
*  The President likes to speak about before… [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3376.48s)]
*  No, historically. When did we have a trade surplus? I'm not talking about the President. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3382.1600000000003s)]
*  Historically. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3386.1600000000003s)]
*  I think early, about a hundred years ago. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3388.1600000000003s)]
*  It was the Great Depression. It was a sign of what was going on. It was during the Great Depression. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3392.88s)]
*  That's a direction none of us wants to go. Tariffs. It's 90 days. We're going to have 90 [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3400.16s)]
*  deals in 90 days. Then there's a 90-day pause. Many of these tariffs, as they say, punishing. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  Tariffs on things that make no sense whatsoever. Where are we going to go with the remaining deals? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3413.04s)]
*  I know of one deal that has been apparently resolved with the United Kingdom. We've got [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3419.04s)]
*  89 more deals to do in just a few more days. Where are we on those deals? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3425.52s)]
*  We are in the midst of negotiations with dozens and dozens of countries. We could sign deals, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3431.04s)]
*  but they're only going to get better. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3438.0s)]
*  That guy's such a huckster. Oh my gosh. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3440.7200000000003s)]
*  Then she asks him about bananas. Do you know what the tariffs on bananas are? He goes, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3442.7200000000003s)]
*  we could build bananas here. She's like, you can't build bananas. What are you talking about [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3449.92s)]
*  here? Play this clip. What's the tariff on bananas? Americans, by the way, love bananas. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3454.56s)]
*  We buy billions of them a year. I love bananas. What's the tariff on bananas? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3459.92s)]
*  The tariff on bananas would be representative of the countries that produce them. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  And what's that tariff? Generally 10%. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3471.2799999999997s)]
*  Correct. 10%. Walmart has already increased the cost of bananas by 8%. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3474.24s)]
*  As countries do deals with us, that will go to zero. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3479.84s)]
*  The cost is on the American consumer now and on the businesses with the confusion now. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3485.68s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I believe you know better. I believe you recognize that a trade deficit is not [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3491.04s)]
*  something to fear. I believe you know that predictability, stability is essential for [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3497.84s)]
*  businesses. I wish you would show that truth to this administration and I yield back. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3503.12s)]
*  The time of the gentlelady is expired. Would you mind, Mr. Chairman, if I make one quick comment [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3510.4s)]
*  to the end? Would that be okay? I'm sorry? Would you mind if I make one quick comment to the [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3514.64s)]
*  representative? Please. There's no uncertainty if you build in America and you produce your product [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3519.3599999999997s)]
*  in America, there will be no tariff. We can't produce bananas in America. So the concept of [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3525.3599999999997s)]
*  building in America and paying no tariff is very, very clear. We cannot build bananas in America. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3528.8s)]
*  Time of the gentlelady has expired. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3536.32s)]
*  He walked right into that one too. He asked for extra time to embarrass himself. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3540.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, but then I thought the most revealing was when he was in front of the Senate. It was actually [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3546.0s)]
*  a question that was asked by a MAGA Republican senator named John Kennedy, who's no affiliation [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3550.32s)]
*  with the Kennedy family. This is the MAGA Republican senator from Louisiana who [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3556.56s)]
*  changed his voice when he became a Republican after being a Democrat many, many decades ago. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3561.7599999999998s)]
*  If you go back and watch his original voice, it was never like this. But anyway, he made up this [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3567.84s)]
*  whole new persona. We see that a lot with MAGA Republicans. But this guy also is someone who [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3572.08s)]
*  believes that Trump has the power to tariff the world. Kennedy does. So what Kennedy was trying [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3578.4s)]
*  to give softball questions to the Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about and trying to [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3584.4s)]
*  understand. So we're using tariffs as a negotiating posture. And if just say a country like Vietnam [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3593.04s)]
*  removes every possible barrier to trade, everyone, and they go, you win, you're the greatest, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3601.28s)]
*  we'll make sure. Zero percent, we'll put no trade restrictions. So he goes, so then you declare a [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3609.04s)]
*  victory, right? And then Howard Lutnick is like, no, no, no. And then they keep having this [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3615.92s)]
*  conversation. I want you to pay attention to it. Then Howard Lutnick starts, they basically go into, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3624.48s)]
*  well, then what if like Vietnam agrees to like buy all of these things from the United States, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3632.48s)]
*  it's a poor country, so it can't do. But then Lutnick's like, now you're talking. Now you're [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3637.6800000000003s)]
*  talking. I want you to think that this is the guy who's in all of these negotiations. This is the [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3644.1600000000003s)]
*  guy negotiating with the European Union and Canada and China and all of these other places [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3652.7200000000003s)]
*  and throughout the world. And this is his view of a deal that even if a country says, we're going [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3658.6400000000003s)]
*  to remove every type of tariff against the United States that could possibly exist, you win, the U.S. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3666.64s)]
*  would not view that as a win and would not reduce the tariffs against the country. Here, watch this. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3672.64s)]
*  If Vietnam, for example, came to you tomorrow and said, okay, Mr. Secretary, you win, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3679.7599999999998s)]
*  we're going to remove all tariffs and all trade barriers [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3687.12s)]
*  with the United States, please do the same. Would you accept that deal? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3692.24s)]
*  Absolutely not. Absolutely not. That would be the silliest thing we could do. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3697.68s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3702.4s)]
*  Vietnam has a hundred and twenty five billion dollar exports to us and imports from us, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3703.92s)]
*  twelve and a half million dollars. And you're thinking Vietnam exports a hundred and twenty five [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3713.12s)]
*  billion? Vietnam exports a hundred and twenty five billion. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3718.72s)]
*  I'm aware of the figures, but tell me where they get it from. They buy 90 billion from China. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3721.6s)]
*  Then they mark it up and send it to us. So you would just have a pathway of China to us. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3726.24s)]
*  You wouldn't accept that deal. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3730.7999999999997s)]
*  No, it's a terrible deal. We're the one with money. We're the one with the store. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3732.3199999999997s)]
*  What's the purpose? What's the purpose of reciprocity then? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3735.4399999999996s)]
*  Is reciprocity not one of your goals? Are you telling the president that we shouldn't seek [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3739.68s)]
*  reciprocity? If that's what you're telling him, why are you trying to do these trade deals? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3745.28s)]
*  What do we want? We want to encourage Vietnam to produce products they're great at producing. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3751.36s)]
*  But I want to get back to reciprocity. You just said you don't believe in it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3756.5600000000004s)]
*  You don't accept reciprocity as a goal. What are you negotiating in these trade deals? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3760.5600000000004s)]
*  Why would we open our bank account and their bank account when ours is too big? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3764.6400000000003s)]
*  Why are you negotiating trade deals? You're trying to get other [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3767.6000000000004s)]
*  countries to lower their tariffs and trade barriers in return for us lowering ours. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3771.2s)]
*  That's true for the things that they'll take from us. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3778.8799999999997s)]
*  That's called reciprocity. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3781.12s)]
*  Of course. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3782.72s)]
*  Are you or are you not seeking reciprocity in these trade deals? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  We are thinking we are absolutely seeking reciprocity with respect to things that can be [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3789.2799999999997s)]
*  reciprocal. But you just said- [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3794.56s)]
*  But when they're importing from China and sending it to us, they're not- [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3795.68s)]
*  If a country came to you and offered you the ultimate reciprocity, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3798.56s)]
*  no tariffs, no trade barriers in return for us doing the same, you would reject that. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3804.8s)]
*  Of course, because they buy from China and send it to us. Don't you agree with me? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3810.88s)]
*  Suppose they said we won't buy from China. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3814.32s)]
*  Now we're talking. Now we're talking. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3816.4s)]
*  Would you- [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3818.88s)]
*  If it was Vietnam- [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3819.2000000000003s)]
*  Would you accept that deal? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3821.04s)]
*  We would consider it for what things? For products? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3822.7200000000003s)]
*  What would you want to change? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3825.28s)]
*  Well, there are certain products we want to reassure. We don't want other people making [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3827.36s)]
*  them. We want to make pharmaceuticals here. We need to protect ourselves. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3832.32s)]
*  So how do you do a deal with that guy when he's basically saying that the only deal he will [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3837.68s)]
*  accept apparently is if he literally destroys another country's economy is the only type of [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3844.96s)]
*  deal that he's even open to? And they have these weird views about a trade deficit when you have a [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3852.4s)]
*  poor country or a poorer country like Vietnam- [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3860.1600000000003s)]
*  And a smaller country. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3863.44s)]
*  ... whose entire GDP is $476 billion, which by the way though, is larger than Qatar. Just to be [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3864.1600000000003s)]
*  clear, when Donald Trump's like, Qatar's the largest, Qatar's entire GDP is 200 billion, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3871.04s)]
*  and Vietnam is a poor country, their entire GDP is 476 billion, how are they going to be buying [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3875.84s)]
*  more things from the United States than the United States buying the cheap things that are being [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3884.96s)]
*  made in Vietnam? It's the strangest war view. And they view that disparity, the deficit, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3890.32s)]
*  as a tariff, which it just, it's the wildest thinking. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3896.88s)]
*  And they view it as a national emergency. And that's the entire basis for Donald Trump blowing [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3900.2400000000002s)]
*  up the global economy. It makes no sense. It's also antithetical to anyone who ever claims that [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3904.8s)]
*  they're into free markets because they're trying to disrupt the free markets. We're going to have [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3909.36s)]
*  a surplus with some folks. We're going to have a deficit from some folks. Neither is not inherently [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3912.96s)]
*  good nor bad. It's just, it is what it is. And to try to, I don't know, bully Vietnam to buy more [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3917.1200000000003s)]
*  of our crap, it's not how markets work. I'm sorry. To Ben's point, it's a poorer country. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3922.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a smaller country. They're not just going to be able to get people to buy American products. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3927.52s)]
*  It's just not how it works. I was in Vietnam. I went there for my honeymoon a few years back. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3932.16s)]
*  Everything is so cheap in Vietnam. You could get a really nice dinner with alcohol for five bucks [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3936.3199999999997s)]
*  in Vietnam. You think they're going to be importing American products that they can't afford? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3941.52s)]
*  Everything is just insane about it on its face. And then to base this entire trade war, disrupting [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3946.16s)]
*  the entire global economy on this just false premise is so absurd. And then to have just no [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3951.6s)]
*  end game. You could see why any time we hear behind the scenes about what any of these [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3957.44s)]
*  countries, I could name them specifically, but I'll be going through all of them, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3963.2000000000003s)]
*  what any of these countries are saying about their dealings with the United States, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3966.16s)]
*  they all have some version of, yeah, we don't even know what they want. It's erratic. They [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3970.0s)]
*  don't make any sense. It's incomprehensible. And when you see Lutnick there, you see why, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3973.92s)]
*  because even in what should be the point of the negotiation, I guess, to get all trade barriers [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3978.32s)]
*  and tariffs down to zero, that's unacceptable. Because you're still going to have a trade [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3983.28s)]
*  deficit. And the whole thing just doesn't make any sense. They're dealing with morons who don't [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3989.92s)]
*  actually have a goal in mind, who don't even necessarily know what they want. And so when [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3995.6800000000003s)]
*  there's no clear delineation of what the goal is, there's no way to actually get to the end of a [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=3999.92s)]
*  deal. The whole thing is crazy. Every time I hear Lutnick speak, I actually get dumber in real time. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4004.96s)]
*  He's such a huckster. He talks in circles. He makes no sense when he speaks. It's not a rational [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4013.76s)]
*  thinking. He comes off calm or whatnot, but he's not like, none of this makes any sense. My head [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4019.6000000000004s)]
*  hurts watching him talk. And you could see there, Kennedy was like, what are you saying, buddy? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. A few other pieces of news I want to bring up just that I think is important. And [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4031.0400000000004s)]
*  I see sometimes people say, don't get distracted by this. We still need to focus on the budget bill [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4037.28s)]
*  and that it's cutting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act health coverage from tens of millions of people. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4044.16s)]
*  We could walk and chew gum at the same time. We're not going to be distracted. We're going to talk [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4050.64s)]
*  about the budget bill over and over again. We're going to talk about Donald Trump's attack on [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4054.64s)]
*  women's reproductive rights. We're going to talk about Donald Trump attacking the Supplemental [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4059.2s)]
*  Nutrition Assistance Program. We're going to, food stamps. We're going to talk about [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4064.72s)]
*  Donald Trump making millions of more people unhoused by attacking rental assistance. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4068.3199999999997s)]
*  We're going to talk about Donald Trump disappearing. Human beings in the United States [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4073.7599999999998s)]
*  will highlight stories like what happened in Milford, Massachusetts, where the Trump regime [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4078.9599999999996s)]
*  detained an 18-year-old named Marcelo Gomes, who was attending high school, was one day away from [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4085.04s)]
*  graduation, was a star volleyball player at the school, and was going to be playing in the band [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4091.68s)]
*  for graduation. And he was disappeared. He's in a detention center right now. There was a walkout [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4098.639999999999s)]
*  there that the Trump regime has to meet its 3,000 a day deportation quota. So they're standing [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4104.8s)]
*  outside courtrooms, raiding construction sites and restaurants, and going after, removing asylum [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4113.44s)]
*  status and temporary protected status of people who are paying taxes and contributing to the country. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4120.4s)]
*  We're not going to stop reporting on all of those things. We're going to report, for example, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4126.879999999999s)]
*  as I said earlier, Columbia University, their ability to be accredited was just removed by [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4131.28s)]
*  the Trump regime after they kissed the ring and bowed down. They did the opposite of Harvard, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4136.96s)]
*  and they still ultimately got attacked. Electricity prices are surging. 75% of companies have already [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4141.839999999999s)]
*  raised prices in response to tariffs. We're seeing a lot of people who are still working [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4148.72s)]
*  in government worried that the Labor Department does not have accurate data anymore, that even [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4153.84s)]
*  the inflation numbers are inaccurate, and that a lot of the data just can't be relied upon anymore. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4160.88s)]
*  We're not going to stop reporting on Trump gutting FEMA and what that means in hurricane season, or how [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4167.2s)]
*  the new head of FEMA, who's never worked in disaster or emergency management in any capacity [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4172.8s)]
*  said that he didn't know that there was a hurricane season, and then said, obviously, it was a joke. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4179.200000000001s)]
*  You joke as the head of FEMA about not knowing what hurricane season is, which can cause tens of [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4184.64s)]
*  thousands of people to lose their lives. Look, we're going to report on the fact that Trump [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4190.56s)]
*  begged for a phone call with Xi Jinping earlier in the morning. China, they put out a statement [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4194.96s)]
*  right away. Trump asked for it. The United States isn't denying that. What happened was the United [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4200.4800000000005s)]
*  States was running out of a supply of rare earth minerals that we needed from China. Trump had to [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4205.76s)]
*  call Xi Jinping and basically beg for it. Then the way Xi Jinping's statement after Trump called, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4210.64s)]
*  it looked like the way a United States would respond after China would call after another [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4220.0s)]
*  world leader would ask for a call. Xi Jinping says, US should cancel all negative measures taken [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4225.84s)]
*  against China. The two sides should reduce misunderstanding. Trump is welcome to visit [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4232.4s)]
*  China again, as though it's like Trump asked for permission to visit. Xi Jinping says, US should [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4238.48s)]
*  handle the Taiwan issue carefully. That was the statement from them, like a statement of strength [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4246.16s)]
*  against Trump's deranged and unhinged posts there. So we're not distracted. We're going to cover all [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4252.48s)]
*  of those things, and we're going to cover what's going on with Musk and Trump, and we're going to [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLfkuKV6qZs&t=4261.2s)]
