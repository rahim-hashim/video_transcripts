# YIKES! Trump gets SHOCK POLL in Texasâ€¦TOTAL DISASTER!!!
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4)
*  Donald Trump's approval in Texas was plummeting even before the catastrophic flash floods hit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=0.0s)]
*  Back in June on June 24th, 2025 the latest polling data we have out of the Texas [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=8.0s)]
*  politics project shows that Donald Trump was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=14.84s)]
*  underwater in Texas for the first time [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=18.52s)]
*  in his second term with only [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  44% of Texans approving and 51% of Texans [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=23.96s)]
*  disapproving also [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  Greg Abbott the governor of Texas had a very low approval rate as well [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=30.76s)]
*  You go in to look at the public opinion of the 89th legislature in Texas [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=36.8s)]
*  People hate their own legislature their MAGA Republican supermajority has only a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=42.72s)]
*  26% [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=49.0s)]
*  Texas voter approval of the legislature that why do you keep on voting these people? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=50.44s)]
*  Here's my thesis that I've always said that Texas is actually not a red state [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=55.48s)]
*  It is a voter suppressed state and a lot of red states that we see [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=61.24s)]
*  Throughout the country quote-unquote red states are voter suppressed states where the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=66.24s)]
*  authoritarian tactics that we see in places like and let's just call it what it is like in Russia in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=72.0s)]
*  Hungary where they do everything they can to keep out people from voting for their own interest [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=78.52s)]
*  We see that in places like Texas [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=84.56s)]
*  We see that in places like Florida and the data bears that out now that was before the flash floods [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=86.72s)]
*  Oh, by the way, when you go into some of these cross tabs, also, I find this interesting as well [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=93.12s)]
*  more than half of Texas voters 53% opposed the ban by the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=99.0s)]
*  Texas legislature while 31% [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=105.72s)]
*  Supported it when it comes to like THC and marijuana and hemp and all of these things that are going on there as well [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=109.36s)]
*  So you start looking at some of these local issues in Texas also and and and the voters are not aligned with where the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  Legislature is so this was before the flash floods hit then the flash floods hit and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Now here's what Christy gnome the secretary the Department of Homeland Security secretary [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=129.44s)]
*  She says the federal government doesn't manage disasters. This is all the state state. This is what the state will fill in some gaps [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  But this is the state here play this clip [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=143.52s)]
*  We as a federal government don't manage these disasters the state does and then Donald Trump said at a cabinet meeting on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=145.68s)]
*  Tuesday that this was a great job [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=154.08s)]
*  He's declaring this an amazing job that took place. He goes we did great Texas did great. This was a big win [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=157.4s)]
*  We saved all of these lights. We should be applauded. You don't believe me. Here's what he said at the cabinet meeting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=164.68s)]
*  Just play it response has been incredible and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=170.34s)]
*  The fact that we got along so well, I don't know. It's not I don't even think that's a political thing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  But we got along so well and it was so unified [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=179.0s)]
*  A lot of lives have been said that could have been as bad as it was and you could always double or triple this thing was just [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=183.22s)]
*  really horrible well [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=190.9s)]
*  Congratulations, I'm a job and appreciate it. Are you going down? I'll be going down on Friday with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=193.5s)]
*  Congratulations on a great job. He said over a hundred people died. No one can look at that response and say the response was great [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=198.88s)]
*  I mean the question is is that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Who's a contributing factor to the information not getting to the camp [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=208.44s)]
*  You know, is it the local of people who didn't give the warnings? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=213.96s)]
*  Did they not get the warnings from the feds was it a breakdown in communication all around? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=218.04s)]
*  Is it the vacancies from the National Weather Service and know of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=222.88s)]
*  Administration is it the failure of FEMA to have the right personnel there and to react and to federalize [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=229.44s)]
*  A lot of the local assets that were needed and to pre position people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=237.92s)]
*  The response was certainly not great and then you go into what the current County Sheriff was saying and the press conference on Tuesday was [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=241.64s)]
*  An unmitigated disaster play this clip. So we understand you have many questions [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=248.96s)]
*  We understand you have many questions [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=262.64s)]
*  We understand that but right now this team up here is focused on bringing people home [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=265.44s)]
*  That's our focus [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=273.84s)]
*  All those questions will be answered. But the priority right now is bringing people home [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  You heard the report because he seems like you're ducking the questions and you know, this this reminds me of Trump's response to kovat [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=281.52s)]
*  You know like a miracle. It's all good. Great job everybody. We've done an amazing job [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to bring in Isaiah Martin running for Congress in Texas is 18th congressional district Isaiah [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=293.26s)]
*  We had John when you were announcing that you were running us back in March already [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=298.98s)]
*  Been many many months since your announcement [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=304.42s)]
*  Let's talk about though what's going on right now on the ground in terms of just the people that you're talking to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=307.18s)]
*  Tell us what the people feel about everything that's taking place in Texas right now specifically the flash floods [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=315.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me I'm super excited to be here [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=322.1s)]
*  You know to be honest with you everybody I talked to can see very clearly that these Republicans are clueless [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  They have no idea what they've been doing. I mean for starters in Texas [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=330.3s)]
*  They've been in power for 30 straight years here statewide and we see time after time [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=334.1s)]
*  They don't understand how to coordinate these type of emergency type situations. And if you look at everything [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=338.98s)]
*  I think you've put a good compilation on the screen. You know, you've just getting complete mixed messaging [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  You got the state saying one thing you got the county saying another thing the federal government and others [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=351.18s)]
*  I mean, here's what we know. We know that county officials had asked for three straight times for more [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=355.32000000000005s)]
*  Equipment to be able to be there for sirens and other things that if such type of a flash flood warning were to happen [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  They could get information directly to people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=368.54s)]
*  We know that the state legislature sitting on a 26 billion dollar surplus [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=370.54s)]
*  But yet they've refused to go and fund these things because they say that it's quote-unquote wasteful [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=374.3s)]
*  Spending and then you have the federal government in which they've been doing everything as they can to use these doge cuts to defund [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=380.14s)]
*  Noah FEMA and all of these things around is a complete clown show [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=387.2s)]
*  Everybody who I talked to on the ground sees it and they want answers [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=392.32s)]
*  So that's why you know, not so long ago [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  I demanded for a full-scale congressional investigation not just into these doge cuts but [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=397.46s)]
*  explicitly as to what happened with this sexist situation because we all [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=403.02s)]
*  Have to be united in trying to find answers because here's the thing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=406.94s)]
*  It's not just what happened here in Kirk County in Texas because we're about to be going into the mix of hurricane season [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  We understand that we're gonna be seeing a lot more disasters as we see and we have to be able to get the answers [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=418.18s)]
*  Before going into having more of these situations happen more and more and more [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=424.18s)]
*  We need a congressional investigation now and it starts immediately to get these answers for the American people, you know right before [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=427.82s)]
*  These flash floods hit we would see the governor of Texas and and others [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=435.06s)]
*  You know engaging in this kind of performative cosplay [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  What you and I were talking about before this interview started this MAGA? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=444.38s)]
*  Dungeons and dragons and no offense to people if they like Dungeons and Dragons or you know, whatever [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=449.7s)]
*  But it's like it's it it it you know, cuz I'm not conflating the two at all [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=455.48s)]
*  I'm just saying that it seems that that they're living in their Mar-a-Lago MAGA [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=460.1s)]
*  Fox world and picking culture wars and dividing and yeah, we're gonna get the National Guard to go after the migrants [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=466.54s)]
*  Texas has one of the you the largest migrant [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  Workforces that's fueling the economy in there and you're gonna send your own National Guard against your own people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=479.22s)]
*  So that you so that you look tough and and that's what was going on before this and so they do the tough guy act [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=485.6s)]
*  then when it comes to basic kind of competence and even [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  How they're handling the press conference, right? That's not a steady, you know hand, you know [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=497.32000000000005s)]
*  They're all over the place [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  100% right and so I mean you're seeing with this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=507.48s)]
*  Republican government then with their priorities in putting on a show [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=512.14s)]
*  That's all they do is set on on doing these press conferences where it's all thoughts and prayers, but no action [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=517.22s)]
*  I want you to think about this for a second. They have put more effort in sending troops [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=524.26s)]
*  To go on these show missions in California [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=529.6600000000001s)]
*  Then they currently are doing to go look for the many missing children that we currently have in Kerr County [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  Think about that for a second [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  It's all hands on deck when it comes to finding the next Fox News Newsmax [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=540.26s)]
*  Political hit for them when it comes for identifying the children that are missing right here in Texas [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=544.42s)]
*  They're a no-show. It is absolutely an abomination and I think that we all should be wondering why is it in our country? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=549.66s)]
*  We do not have a full-scale all hands on deck efforts from the government to go forward and to locate this situation [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=556.34s)]
*  Another thing it is ridiculous to me that we have all of these cuts that we're talking about whether it's for Noah whether it's for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=562.74s)]
*  FEMA to go and give tax cuts to the richest people in America to me. That's insane [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  You mean to tell me we've got four and a half trillion dollars to go give tax cuts to some rich dude buying his third or fifth [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=574.46s)]
*  Yacht somewhere. We don't have enough money to adequately fund [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=580.22s)]
*  Recovery warnings or FEMA emergency management because here's the deal after these floodwaters receive [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of recovery that needs to be done [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=589.8s)]
*  And if you have an agency that's consistently being gutted you see staff leads that are consistently being let down [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=592.88s)]
*  That is a fault of this Republican government that has no idea what they're doing as a matter of fact [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=598.64s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to completely undermine the fabric of what we have in this country [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=603.64s)]
*  And I think that we all should be calling that out because storm recovery and storms floods [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=608.08s)]
*  Wherever doesn't care if you're a Democrat or Republican you got a Trump sign or a Kamala sign in your front yard [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=613.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It's indiscriminate and comes after everybody and we all in this country should be united [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=618.7s)]
*  Against this type of tomfoolery that we're seeing right here in Texas and around the nation, you know, Isaiah I often [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=624.58s)]
*  Talk about you know when you see the energy on the ground and it seems all right [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=631.0200000000001s)]
*  Whether it was with a Beto O'Rourke campaign or whoever. All right [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=637.1s)]
*  It seems that there's it seems that there's some energy things could change [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=641.6600000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=646.42s)]
*  Maybe Texas is finally gonna vote for its interest against continuing to vote for people who are literally [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=647.02s)]
*  Harming the people over and over again. I mean you just go back over the years the electric grid [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=654.54s)]
*  They did every every issue, you know [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=659.06s)]
*  but then after talking about it we go into the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=661.4599999999999s)]
*  elections and then you see all of the voter suppression tactics that they one thing they're good at the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  Magna Republicans is voter suppression and making it very difficult for people and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=670.66s)]
*  Discouraging people and taking away people's energy. So why is it gonna be this time? Why are you gonna win this time? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=676.34s)]
*  Why why is the Republican stronghold going to not be the same this time? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=682.9399999999999s)]
*  Why are people gonna finally vote for their interests or I mean it's reflected in the polling data [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  But or are we just gonna get to another midterms and another whatever where it's like, alright, Texas you just keep on doing this [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=695.34s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=702.46s)]
*  you know right here in the 18th congressional district in central Houston, I can tell you this that people are fed up and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=704.5s)]
*  Ultimately what they want to see is to go and turn out to the polls [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=710.22s)]
*  Not just by the margins that we traditionally have seen because he hears a deal in the 18th district [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=713.66s)]
*  We have for the lot for the first time in a very long time had very subpar voter turnout for our district [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=719.4599999999999s)]
*  And so we know that in order for us to win statewide [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna have to turn out the deep blue areas of our state [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=728.9s)]
*  So that means when I get into office particularly right here in Houston [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=732.42s)]
*  We have to be investing consistently to go and communicate to people all across the board [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=735.9399999999999s)]
*  We have to be investing in going in and in having an extensive door knocking operation [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=740.14s)]
*  But we also have to talk about the needs of people economically [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=745.3s)]
*  Are we gonna make their life more affordable what we're gonna do to make universal child care thing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=749.42s)]
*  What we're gonna do to guarantee health care [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=753.5s)]
*  I think those are the type of conversations that are gonna put Texans to say look [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=755.0999999999999s)]
*  This Republican government has been in there for 30 straight years and look at what they promised [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=759.9799999999999s)]
*  They promised that they were gonna have historic property tax relief for the statewide level and in reality [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=765.0999999999999s)]
*  People's property taxes have gone up every single year [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=771.9799999999999s)]
*  We see our schools defunded consistently despite the fact that Republicans say they're gonna do something about it now all of a sudden now [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=774.5s)]
*  We're seeing a big defunding and a lot of the money that's going to our schools with this big ridiculous school voucher scam that we're seeing [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=781.78s)]
*  So I think it's connecting the dots about how for 30 straight years [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=787.76s)]
*  Texas Republicans have misused our tax dollars in our state and they are not working in the best interest of the people of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=791.36s)]
*  Our state and I think that when we do that statewide [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=798.06s)]
*  We also talked about this from a federal level because you know, I will be [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=800.7s)]
*  You know, I am running for Congress and eventually we'll be in Congress [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=804.94s)]
*  We have to be talking about how these pocketbook issues are gonna be affecting people on their day-to-day lives [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=808.38s)]
*  And I feel very confident that when we do that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=813.32s)]
*  We will be able to see not just in Texas but across the nation a shockwave of blue wave [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=815.48s)]
*  Change that are coming to really change the foundation of this country because I know we can do it [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23--f10IoD4&t=820.3000000000001s)]
