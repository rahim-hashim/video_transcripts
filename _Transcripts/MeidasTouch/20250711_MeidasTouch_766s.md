# FURIOUS Canada DESTROYS Trump where it HURTS MOST!!
**MeidasTouch:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo)
*  Canada is furious at the United States as they should be, but frankly, Canada's moved on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada recognizes that the United States, sadly, is no longer an ally under the Trump regime, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=7.3s)]
*  and Canada has forged partnerships with the European Union and the rest of the world, saying goodbye to the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=13.8s)]
*  The boycott is stronger than ever. The travel boycott is stronger than ever. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  And here Donald Trump yesterday sends another letter to Canada, defaming the great nation of Canada, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  and saying that he's imposing 35% tariffs against Canada until you Canadians stop bringing in the fentanyl [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=35.0s)]
*  and killing the Americans, which is absolutely not happening. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Donald Trump is a deranged, lunatic, felon, wannabe dictator who's destroying the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=48.2s)]
*  I've had Canadian friends who describe America right now as the meth lab that's below it, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=56.0s)]
*  a meth lab that's blowing up. It's a powder keg meth lab right now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=61.8s)]
*  I'll just show you briefly Donald Trump's letter that he sent to Canada. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=66.7s)]
*  I don't want to read the whole thing. It'll make us all far less smart. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=70.7s)]
*  And then I want to show you some stats about Canada that you may find interesting, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=74.1s)]
*  how Canadians are super furious at the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=78.7s)]
*  Donald Trump writes this letter to Prime Minister Carney and says, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  it's a great honor for me to send you this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  And then Donald Trump goes on to say that, but Canada has financially retaliated against the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=88.1s)]
*  Then Donald Trump goes on to say that we had to tariff Canada to deal with the nation's fentanyl crisis, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=94.6s)]
*  which is caused in part by Canada's failure to stop drugs from pouring into our country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=102.9s)]
*  Trump is clearly being defamatory. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=109.3s)]
*  They're no different than what Putin says about denazifying Ukraine because Donald Trump thinks like Putin. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=111.3s)]
*  I mean, having the United States south of your border is like having Russia be on your border in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=118.3s)]
*  That's it. That's how you have to think about it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=125.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's language about annexing Canada is just like Putin's annexation language. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=127.2s)]
*  Even if Donald Trump is a taco, then Donald Trump goes on to say that he's imposing the 35% tariffs, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=133.4s)]
*  but he will remove the tariffs as soon as the fentanyl stops pouring in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=140.9s)]
*  And then as we wrote on the Midas Touch Network, not this idiocy again, only 43 pounds of fentanyl, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=146.1s)]
*  43 pounds were intercepted at the US-Canada border in 2024. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=152.1s)]
*  And it's far more dangerous what the United States is sending to Canada than the opposite way. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=158.1s)]
*  As I said, Canada's moving on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=165.2s)]
*  I mean, Prime Minister Carney posted in the face of global trade challenges, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=167.2s)]
*  the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=171.6s)]
*  New UK trade strategy, IDES Canada as key partner to boost economy and procurement opportunities. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=177.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney's approval, by the way, is about 61% or so, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  whereas Donald Trump's approval is in the 30s or low 40s here, depending on what poll. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  As Tara Hoops points out, Canada is one of our top trading partners. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  We just had an election focused on affordability. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Raising import taxes now will only increase our cost of living, worsen the housing crisis, and drive inflation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=205.1s)]
*  It's a self-defeating move that undermines our own economic priorities. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=212.1s)]
*  Whether you're looking at crude petroleum, vehicles and oil parts, minerals, natural gas, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=217.6s)]
*  wood and lumber products, Canada is our biggest trading partner in the United States. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=224.1s)]
*  But that doesn't matter to Donald Trump at all. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=229.3s)]
*  As I mentioned at the outset, the Canadian boycott is going strong. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=233.1s)]
*  This one Forbes article talks about how Canadian visitors to US plummet 33% in June, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=237.7s)]
*  the sixth strength month of steep declines. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=244.1s)]
*  Last month saw one-third fewer Canadians visiting the US by car compared to June 2024, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=248.4s)]
*  as Canada propels international tourism declines to an expected overall economic loss of $29 billion in 2025. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Canada strong with the boycott by Canada. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=266.6s)]
*  Here it says the volume of Canadians taking road trips into the US, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=271.6s)]
*  the means by which most Canadians visit, dropped by 33% last month compared to June 2024. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=276.1s)]
*  According to new data from Statistics Canada, following a 38% drop in May, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=282.8s)]
*  I have a feeling that in July and August that number is going to look closer to 45%. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=288.8s)]
*  I honestly believe it's closer to 50% right now, but that's just me anecdotally. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=293.5s)]
*  There was also a 22% decline in air travelers from Canada year over year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=298.6s)]
*  June was the sixth consecutive month of steep declines in inbound Canadian travel, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=304.3s)]
*  including double digit year over year drops in car travel and air travel to the US every month since April. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=310.0s)]
*  Do y'all remember when I was covering some of this stuff back in February [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=316.7s)]
*  and people were saying if it's just like 10% or 8%, the damage could be catastrophic to US tourism. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=320.8s)]
*  Well, it's now in the 30s to 40% range. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=328.5s)]
*  And so you may be saying, but why are the is that data reflected in the US economy? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=333.0s)]
*  It is actually when you see 33,000 private sector job losses in the ADP private payroll data. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=338.3s)]
*  But as I mentioned, Donald Trump's being funny, manipulating the job numbers as he controls the Commerce and Labor Department. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=346.7s)]
*  And Donald Trump's fired all the career civil servants. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=354.9s)]
*  So Trump claims miraculously, even though there was a 33,000 drop in private sector jobs, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=357.7s)]
*  according to the ADP payroll, that there was 147,000 jobs created spurred by new teacher jobs and government jobs created [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=363.9s)]
*  as Donald Trump's Doge is destroying our government. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=372.8s)]
*  And it goes on to talk about how disastrous this is going to harm our country here in the United States. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=377.8s)]
*  Also, this is having really sending Las Vegas into a recession right now with all if you've seen all of these hotels, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=383.6s)]
*  I know lots of Canadians would love to visit Las Vegas here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  And then you've canceled your trips to Vegas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=395.7s)]
*  And all of these hotels are trying to offer all of these discounts, please, please, please come to, you know, but people ain't doing it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=398.6s)]
*  Okay, people ain't doing it right now because Donald Trump's essentially declaring war on Canada, not just a trade war, a war over Canadian sovereignty. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=405.2s)]
*  I'll remind you all that I had Charlie Angus on the show recently. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=413.8s)]
*  And here's what Charlie Angus had to say about Donald Trump and people in the regime trying to claim that Canada is some sort of terrorist safe haven here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=418.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=427.4s)]
*  Well, this is so true. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=428.2s)]
*  I mean, he came to the G7 a moment when world leaders came together to try and sort of put some stability in a destabilized world. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=429.5s)]
*  Instead, we got Donald Trump, who blew the whole thing up and then scrammed out of Canada before he had to confront President Zelensky. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=437.2s)]
*  Then he went to NATO in Brussels. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  Again, another key point where the European allies were trying to secure with the world some level of stability with the increasing violence [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=446.8s)]
*  we are seeing in Israel, Gaza, Iran, the situation with Russia and Donald Trump came in and lit gasoline all over the place and then walked out. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=456.6s)]
*  So in those, what you saw in between those two pivotal international summits was that Canada said, well, wait a minute, we've got to find a future. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=466.8s)]
*  And it's not with this guy and it's not with the United States. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=476.6s)]
*  You know, we have American officials hosting meetings claiming that Canada is some kind of terrorist haven. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=479.3s)]
*  They're saying that we're sending massive gangs of El Salvadorians over the Canadian border. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=486.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry. You've ever visit Canada. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=490.8s)]
*  Could you show us where we have our El Salvadorian gangs? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think what next? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  They're going to find weapons of mass destruction in a bunker in some nice leafy suburb in Canada. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=496.7s)]
*  The language that Trump is using against Canada is actually having a hugely detrimental effect on American businesses because Canadians are pulling out. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=503.4s)]
*  Canadians are not traveling there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=511.4s)]
*  So I don't know what Prime Minister Carney will do in response to this latest temper tantrum by President Taco. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=513.4s)]
*  Certainly, you know, when we see that he's throwing around issues like non-existent threats like dairy, it's it's more of his bad theater. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=521.8s)]
*  But we've seen the show so many times. We know the punch lines. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=529.6s)]
*  It's not funny. Nobody gets upset. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=532.5s)]
*  So I think Canada is just going to have to do what it's going to do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=535.0s)]
*  We'll probably have to go back pound for pound, dollar for dollar in trade retaliations. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=537.5s)]
*  As we watch the American economy get weaker and more unsure because who is going to invest right now? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=542.2s)]
*  Who's going to start moving product for the American economy when Donald Trump is blowing things up every chance he can get? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=547.9000000000001s)]
*  And here, Charlie Angus, when I spoke to him a few days ago, he's saying, look, Canada needs to prepare drones and weapons of war and build up its military, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=555.4000000000001s)]
*  which, by the way, it's doing to protect against an American invasion. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  Charlie Angus, leader of the resistance in Canada, very popular out there, became a good friend of mine. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=571.2s)]
*  He and I have a big announcement about maple mitis in Canada that I'm excited to be making super, super soon. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=576.9000000000001s)]
*  You're going to love our expansion into Canada. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  So you'll wait for the announcement. It's coming soon. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=585.7s)]
*  But here he says, look, Canadians and the Canadian government should prepare the way Ukraine prepared for war against Russia's invasion. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=588.7s)]
*  He says, you know, we should take Trump literally here, play this clip. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=596.2s)]
*  This is a very, very sick and dark exhibition. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=599.4s)]
*  So when we look at this as the people that we're negotiating with, Canadians need to be really ready. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=603.3s)]
*  We are upping our investment in military spending significantly. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=609.5s)]
*  We are now procuring from the Europeans, whereas before we would have just gone to the United States as per usual and buy gear. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  We're not buying gear from the United States. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=622.3s)]
*  I don't know what the prime minister is thinking, but if I was him, I'd be inviting over Ukrainians to start setting up factories so that we can set up those hundred dollar drones, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=624.3s)]
*  because it's our border, it's our waterways, our lakes and our harbors that are now seriously under threat because we don't know where Trump is going to go. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=632.9s)]
*  I know in the media in Canada, they don't want to talk about that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=644.0s)]
*  They don't want to act like they're being hysterical. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RhNFF1ooo&t=647.1999999999999s)]
