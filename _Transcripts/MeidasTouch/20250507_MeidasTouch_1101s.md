# Dems Unleash BRUTAL CROSS-EXAM of GOP Witnesses
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE)
*  The second form, ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=0.0s)]
*  Ma'am, please, ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=3.2s)]
*  I'd like you to avoid the filibuster so I can get to all my questions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=7.28s)]
*  The Democrats were ripping into Donald Trump's cabinet members testifying on Capitol Hill [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=11.52s)]
*  with some powerful cross-examination. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=17.42s)]
*  You saw right there, Democratic Congresswoman Escobar from Texas cross-examining the dog [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=20.18s)]
*  killer, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=27.72s)]
*  More on that cross-exam in a little bit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=31.08s)]
*  I now want to show you Democratic Congressmember Mark Pocan, his cross-examination of Treasury [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=33.28s)]
*  Secretary Scott Besson, where he basically just asks Besson the most basic question, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  who pays for Trump's tariffs? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=46.28s)]
*  Watch the response. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  No, no, no, answer the questions I asked, please. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=57.72s)]
*  I only have five minutes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=61.64s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=62.64s)]
*  Sorry, well... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=63.64s)]
*  Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=64.64s)]
*  Please. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=66.64s)]
*  The question is very simply, who pays tariffs, Mr. Chairman? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=67.64s)]
*  I'd like him to answer that question. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=69.92s)]
*  He wants to answer other questions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=71.8s)]
*  Well, Congressman, if the exporters, they dislike tariffs so much, why wouldn't they, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=74.12s)]
*  I think what you're trying to get me to say... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=87.2s)]
*  Did you remember the question? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=88.48s)]
*  I'm not sure you did. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=89.48s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=90.48s)]
*  That they... it's a very complicated question. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=91.48s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=95.16s)]
*  People pay tariffs, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=96.16s)]
*  I'm not reclaiming my time, Mr. Secretary. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=97.64s)]
*  Reclaiming my time, Mr. Secretary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=100.64s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=103.8s)]
*  You clearly aren't going to answer it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=105.2s)]
*  I'm not going to waste my... [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=106.48s)]
*  Next up, Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett goes one by one with the individuals [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=107.56s)]
*  who the MAGA Republicans called to this committee hearing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  And she goes and explains, seems pretty easy that Trump's policies are bad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't you agree? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Don't you think that these are some low IQ policies? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  She says. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=128.12s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=129.12s)]
*  Okay, I don't really know where to begin. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=130.12s)]
*  We've got a lot of ground to cover in about five minutes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=131.12s)]
*  So let's go. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=135.16s)]
*  I've got three statements that I want to know if you agree or disagree with. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=136.16s)]
*  And I want to just go down the row. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=142.12s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=144.28s)]
*  Does cutting pay typically assist in recruiting a workforce? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=145.28s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=149.12s)]
*  No. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=150.12s)]
*  No. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=151.12s)]
*  Generally, no. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=152.12s)]
*  No. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=153.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=154.12s)]
*  It sounds like a low IQ implementation to me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=155.12s)]
*  So let's go to the next one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=160.88s)]
*  Does poor working conditions assist with recruitment? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=162.76s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=165.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=166.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=167.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=168.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=169.72s)]
*  It sounds like another low IQ implementation to me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=170.72s)]
*  And finally, I'm going to start with Mr. Potter because I don't know how this is going to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  go. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=178.24s)]
*  Does union busting help with recruitment? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=179.24s)]
*  No. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=182.44s)]
*  I know nothing about unions whatsoever. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=183.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=186.16s)]
*  I don't know anything about unions either. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=187.16s)]
*  No. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=189.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=190.6s)]
*  So again, another low IQ implementation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=191.6s)]
*  I just want to be clear that the American people should know that these are all Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=194.12s)]
*  2.0 policies. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=197.72s)]
*  So when we say that he's failed, let me tell you, we got receipts and those are some of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=199.56s)]
*  the receipts. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=203.84s)]
*  So when we start talking. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=205.04s)]
*  So then the MAGA Republicans were getting so ripped to shreds yesterday and they really [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=206.3s)]
*  have no ability to even debate anymore because they just basically take whatever Donald Trump [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=211.48s)]
*  posts on social media and then they're like, okay, I guess that's what we believe in now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=218.32s)]
*  And they know that they get flustered and that they can't even justify their positions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=222.8s)]
*  I showed you this thing that they were doing last week and they're continuing to do it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=228.36s)]
*  this week. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=232.72s)]
*  I'm talking about the members of Congress now, the MAGA Republican Congress members. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=233.72s)]
*  So they don't even speak or debate with the Democratic Congress members anymore. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=237.68s)]
*  They stay mute. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=243.16s)]
*  They go silent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=244.24s)]
*  So you have a Democratic Congress member like Congress member, Naguus, and he'll say, okay, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=245.68s)]
*  could we debate this amendment because that's what we're supposed to do in Congress? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=251.28s)]
*  Who wants to discuss this? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  I'd love to just debate it so I can see why you oppose it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=257.84s)]
*  And we can let's discuss our ideas in public as legislators. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=261.64s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=266.84s)]
*  And then the MAGA Republicans just they refuse to respond. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=267.84s)]
*  I'm going to stop the video after four or five seconds of the silence. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=271.28s)]
*  So you'll get the point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=276.32s)]
*  But it goes on for four minutes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=277.32s)]
*  And Congress member Naguus, the Democratic Congress members, just like, okay, no one, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  no one, no one here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=284.2s)]
*  Watch this clip right here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  I support it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  Perhaps I'll try something a little different this time because I have I have made repeated [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=287.88000000000005s)]
*  offers to the chairman to try to engage him in debate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=292.92s)]
*  I've made good faith efforts to convince my colleagues that they should rise to the occasion [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  and on behalf of their constituents be willing to defend their values, defend the positions [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  that they have taken. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  But that has fallen, unfortunately, on deaf ears. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=310.6s)]
*  It was just blanket refusal on the part of my Republican colleagues to engage in any [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  kind of debate. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=317.88s)]
*  So what I will just do, I will give my Republican colleagues an opportunity to explain to their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=318.88s)]
*  constituents, to their colleagues and to the American people why they believe this amendment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=328.32s)]
*  should not be approved by the committee. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  Then we have Democratic Congress member really grill into Treasury Secretary Besant right [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=343.52s)]
*  here about Scott Besant's employment of this guy, Marco Alas, who made all these doge [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=351.11999999999995s)]
*  worker who made racist post. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=359.4s)]
*  And then Besant tries to play dumb about it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  Great cross exam skills here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  About statements that Mr. Alas had made in the prior year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  One was you could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  Another was that he wanted to normalize Indian hate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  The third was just for the record, I was racist before it was cool. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=381.56s)]
*  And another was I just want a eugenic immigration policy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=387.04s)]
*  Is that too much to ask? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  This man resigned shortly after that article was published. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=392.92s)]
*  But you don't recall him being there? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, I did not recall that individual's name, but that individual was terminated. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=400.04s)]
*  He was terminated. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=404.68s)]

*  he's continuing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=415.04s)]

*  Do you believe that the Constitution grants everyone in our country the right to due process, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=530.12s)]

*  Yes or no. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=541.16s)]
*  Do you believe the Constitution... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=542.16s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=543.16s)]
*  Do you... ma'am. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=544.16s)]
*  We're claiming my time, Mr. Chairman. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=545.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=548.16s)]
*  Secretary Noem, I'm just looking for a yes or no here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=549.16s)]
*  Do you believe the Constitution guarantees due process to everyone in America? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=551.6s)]
*  Due process is exactly what this Congress lays out. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=556.6s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=558.76s)]

*  Ma'am, I'm trying to ascertain your understanding of the law as it applies to your department. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=563.48s)]
*  You as its leader should be able to give us a yes or no answer because judge after judge [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=568.56s)]
*  has ruled that the law is not being followed. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=574.64s)]
*  Do you believe that the US government has the authority to deport American citizens? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=577.2s)]
*  No, and we are not deporting US citizens. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=581.36s)]
*  I'm so happy to hear that you do not believe that the law gives you that authority because [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=584.0s)]
*  the federal government has no authority under US laws to deport any American citizen. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=589.76s)]
*  And as I know, everyone viewing this hearing today knows that several American citizens [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=596.0s)]
*  have been deported to date. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=600.6s)]
*  Secretary Noem, that was not a question. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=602.64s)]
*  Secretary Noem, that oath that we both swore before taking office was to protect and defend [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=604.28s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States, not the president, not a political party, the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=609.52s)]

*  That's what this is. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=642.24s)]
*  It's strategic uncertainty, crazy Ivan. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=643.36s)]
*  And so you just don't know what crazy Ivan is going to do. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=646.52s)]
*  And here the Democrats are like, OK, for like Americans, like regular folk, like we don't [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=650.02s)]
*  want crazy Ivan. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=655.0s)]
*  Like we just want our paychecks and we want to be able to afford housing and we want to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=656.4s)]
*  be able to have health care and we want to be able to raise children and we want to be [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=660.36s)]

*  We don't crazy Ivan. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=669.36s)]
*  We're not looking for crazy fricking Ivan. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=670.68s)]
*  This is actually the Republican policy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=673.52s)]
*  They call it the crazy Ivan theory. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=675.8s)]
*  And that Trump's crazy Ivan. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=678.64s)]
*  They've unleashed crazy Ivan on us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=680.24s)]
*  You think I'm joking? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  You're playing this clip right here. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  So I just recently from one of my suppliers got the tariff surcharge on things. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=684.8s)]
*  In addition to the tariff surcharge, guess what else got raised? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=690.0s)]
*  American made walnut plaques. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=693.3599999999999s)]
*  That has nothing to do with tariffs, but companies take advantage and do that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=695.76s)]
*  So right now we are getting screwed right and left because of the indiscriminate use [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=699.0s)]
*  of tariffs. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  That's the reality for Main Street. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=705.2s)]
*  And you go off to Beverly Hills for private investor conferences and talk about crazy [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=707.2s)]
*  Ivan theories. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=711.38s)]
*  Answer that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=712.82s)]
*  What is the crazy Ivan theory of tariffs that you mentioned at the summit? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=713.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, sir, I've had meetings with more than 50 small lenders. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=718.12s)]
*  So the I want to clarify that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  I would also say that in game theory, strategic uncertainty of which the you seem to like [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=727.12s)]
*  the name crazy Ivan. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=733.88s)]
*  Well, it's your words, correct? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=734.88s)]
*  Didn't you use crazy Ivan? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=736.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you've used it five times. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's the question. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  I am saying the strategic uncertainty is part of negotiations. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=742.8s)]
*  That should we say, oh, here's what we'll accept. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  Please take that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=750.16s)]
*  OK, I've got your answer. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=751.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=752.16s)]
*  I'm going to reclaim my time again. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=753.16s)]
*  So for a small business, we don't have that luxury, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=754.16s)]
*  When the ports are empty in California and we can't get goods and people are stocking [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  up for Christmas goods, crazy Ivan is great for. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=762.18s)]
*  Please don't take the offense. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=766.34s)]
*  Really rich people like you. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=767.34s)]
*  But for people like me, it's not right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=768.78s)]
*  That's what makes small businesses fail. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=771.38s)]
*  That's what makes people lose their jobs. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=773.02s)]
*  That's what makes the stock market tank. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=775.02s)]
*  So I'll ask one more time. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=777.6999999999999s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  Sir, the history would show that it is a complicated mix of who pays the tariffs over various [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=781.54s)]
*  times. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=788.22s)]
*  So that's exactly the problem. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=789.22s)]
*  If your answer and you are a very educated person, you're very impressive bio, cannot [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=790.5400000000001s)]
*  answer the question who pays tariffs because you won't answer that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=794.5s)]
*  And you say it's a complicated issue. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=797.5s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=799.3000000000001s)]
*  Consumers pay Trump's tariff tax. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=801.5400000000001s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=804.1s)]
*  The crazy Ivan theory, everybody. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=805.1s)]
*  Here's the clip that I showed you at the beginning of Democratic Congresswoman Escobar grilling [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=808.86s)]
*  Kristi Noem right here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=813.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  For any of the individuals who were deported, who had U.S. citizen children deported with [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=816.3s)]
*  them, were they given an opportunity to sign that form? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=821.9s)]
*  When these, the specific cases that you're referencing with these children, it was the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=825.74s)]
*  parents' choice to take them. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=829.9399999999999s)]
*  And did I follow through on the policy? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=832.06s)]
*  To keep families together. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=835.66s)]
*  Ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=837.14s)]
*  I told you at the top of this, ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=839.78s)]
*  I said that the questions are really simple. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=844.1s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=846.62s)]
*  Were these, was that form used in any of those cases? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=847.62s)]
*  I will get back to you on that specific form. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=850.9s)]
*  I don't know the number, but I do know these mothers were on the record. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=852.98s)]
*  The second form, ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=856.5400000000001s)]
*  Ma'am, please, ma'am, reclaiming my time. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  I'd like you to avoid the filibuster so I can get to all my questions. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=863.5s)]
*  Ma'am, answering your questions. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=866.7s)]
*  And then Congressmember Moskowitz had this great rant. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=867.98s)]
*  This is epic. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  This is the kind of 10 rant right here. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=872.3s)]
*  And he does a really good job here where he goes and talks about, oh, so Trump woke up [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=874.26s)]
*  and he was watching a show about Alcatraz. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=879.42s)]
*  So now we have to all be for Alcatraz. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=882.26s)]
*  And then Donald Trump wants the Tower of Movies. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  This is actually, Moskowitz should probably just be a stand up comedian. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=886.9s)]
*  This is funny stuff right here. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=890.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=891.9s)]
*  I was listening to the ranking member and she brought up something about Trump talking [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=892.9s)]
*  about Alcatraz. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=896.9799999999999s)]
*  And of course, look, this is just another distraction to divert attention away from [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=898.7s)]
*  the tariffs or rising prices or the struggle on Main Street. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=902.94s)]
*  But since we're having a hearing on prisons, it's lucky timing for me. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=907.38s)]
*  So three times more expensive than any prison to operate in 1959, Alcatraz was. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=912.78s)]
*  It needs about $250 million to shore up the infrastructure and utilities. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=919.98s)]
*  All food and water has to be barged in. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=924.7s)]
*  Sewage has to be barged out. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=926.4200000000001s)]
*  The facility is almost 100 years old. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=928.46s)]
*  And so I don't get it in the days of Doge, where we're cutting budgets, we got to find [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  savings. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=935.7800000000001s)]
*  Now we're going to what we're going to cut Medicaid and SNAP so that we can pour money [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=936.9s)]
*  into into Alcatraz. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=941.1s)]
*  First of all, have you been to Alcatraz recently? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  It literally is a it's a rust box walking around. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  You need a tetanus shot just to go into the building. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=948.74s)]
*  Do we still give tetanus shots or has RFK gotten rid of those? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=951.58s)]
*  I can't I can't keep up. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=954.42s)]
*  And so listen, where did the president get this idea all of a sudden? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=958.3s)]
*  Right. Where did he get the idea? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=963.18s)]
*  Perhaps he was watching Escape from Alcatraz. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=964.78s)]
*  Right. And I brought boards because some people are visual learners. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=968.06s)]
*  Perhaps he was watching Escape from Alcatraz by Clint Eastwood. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=971.02s)]
*  Actually, funny part about that, it was actually on television in South Florida. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=975.66s)]
*  It was on PBS South Florida over the weekend when Trump was at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=980.94s)]
*  In fact, he made his announcement just hours after it aired. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=987.2600000000001s)]
*  You know, PBS, the programming that he's trying to get rid of. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=990.62s)]
*  So just in case you're keeping up right. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=993.5s)]
*  It's two dolls for girls and zero Elmo's. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=995.2600000000001s)]
*  OK. But maybe maybe I'm wrong. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=998.74s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't maybe it wasn't that maybe he was watching The Rock with Sean [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1001.62s)]
*  Connery. You know this one. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1006.98s)]
*  This is where Sean Connery goes back to Alcatraz because he originally escaped [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1007.98s)]
*  Alcatraz and needed like an expert on on chemical weapons. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1013.46s)]
*  Maybe the president was just Netflixing and chilling, like watching watching [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1017.3000000000001s)]
*  watching The Rock, which is not to be confused with The Rock. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1020.98s)]
*  Right. That's a different that's a different person. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1023.7s)]
*  And then the president's really excited about the sharks. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1026.3s)]
*  Right. He's talking about all the sharks and the person escaped. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1029.18s)]
*  He lost his clothing. So, you know, sharks, they don't have laser beams on. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1032.22s)]
*  They don't have laser guns, but maybe maybe maybe the sharks are going to be there. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1036.1s)]
*  So this is just all ridiculous. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1040.54s)]
*  But even then, all of a sudden, after after that, we we heard like, oh, we were going [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1044.54s)]
*  to tariff the movies. Well, hold on a second. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1050.1799999999998s)]
*  Why would we tariff the movies? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1053.82s)]
*  This is where the president is getting his ideas from. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1055.3s)]
*  We can't tariff the the policy idea making of the presidency. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1058.4199999999998s)]
*  And look, I know what my colleagues are going to say. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1063.78s)]
*  They're going to say, Jared, just let the president cook. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1065.82s)]
*  This is 40 chess he's playing. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1068.4199999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to say, maybe he's just watching late night movies, perhaps. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKWHm60BnE&t=1071.46s)]
