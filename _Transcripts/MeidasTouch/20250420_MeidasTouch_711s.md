# Trump Quickly WRECKS the Lives of his TOP SUPPORTERS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE)
*  Surprise, surprise. Donald Trump is screwing over one of his most reliable voting groups, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=0.0s)]
*  truck drivers. About 80% of all truck drivers voted for Donald Trump and 90% of all truck drivers out [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=5.2s)]
*  there in the United States voted. Often they lived in critical key swing states, so truck drivers [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  could have turned the balance of this election and tipped it in favor of Donald Trump. Now, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=19.84s)]
*  over the past week, what's going on? Trump just absolutely destroying the incomes of those employed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=25.28s)]
*  in America's number one job among non-college educated men? Truck drivers. The average seven-day [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=31.68s)]
*  van rate mile drop to negative 40% and still falling. Yep, Trump won this demographic by 80%. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=39.04s)]
*  His core electorate, as Jay in Keeve puts it, Craig Fuller from Freight Alley explains, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=46.56s)]
*  the trucking market conditions are soft, but with imports and exports collapsing, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=54.08s)]
*  the industry is in for a very rough season in the coming months. The winds are picking up, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=60.08s)]
*  but the hurricane is still offshore. The way I've described it right now is it's like a tsunami [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=66.4s)]
*  where the shore recedes and you see that tsunami coming and you know where this story is going to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=72.48s)]
*  end and it's not going to go well for truckers. The only difference with the tsunami example is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=79.44s)]
*  a tsunami and mini tsunamis and average-sized tsunamis are already hitting this industry. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=85.28s)]
*  As Dominic Tullo says, COVID level supply shocks are beginning to happen. The general public and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  most operators have no idea what could be headed our way if this is not fixed within a week and it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=99.92s)]
*  won't be. May 2020 had 51 shipment blank sailings over 80 so far in April 2025. COVID actually will [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=107.92s)]
*  look like good times for the trucking industry. Let me repeat that stat one more time for you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=119.6s)]
*  In May 2020, there were 51 shipments of blank sailings already over 80 in April of 2025. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=125.92s)]
*  Just for the non-truck drivers and people who don't follow freight, blank sailings occur when [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  ocean carriers skip scheduled port calls due to low freight demand or equipment shortages, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=141.76s)]
*  disrupting supply chains. So in April 2025, over 80 blank sailings were reported surpassing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=148.16s)]
*  the 51 from May 2020, signaling a severe collapse in global shipping activity. This spike in blank [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=155.12s)]
*  sailings could exacerbate the trucking market woes as reduced import and exports shrink freight [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  volumes, intensifying economic pressure. Craig Fuller from Freight Alley goes on to say more. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=173.6s)]
*  Many truck drivers I've spoken with don't realize how quickly container volumes have collapsed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=181.12s)]
*  Starting in May, port freight out of California will be almost eliminated. It's going to be a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=187.76s)]
*  bloodbath, bloodbath they are saying for truck drivers. And just as we told you before, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=196.56s)]
*  the polling by groups like CDL Life and others showed 75 to 80 percent of truck drivers were [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  supportive of Donald Trump. Again, you just take a look at these graphs of the canceled sailings by [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=210.56s)]
*  the major container shipping firms by month. And again, you see a total collapse. Derek [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=216.32s)]
*  Thompson posted the following. New Pod, a lot of companies are definitely going to go under. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=223.12s)]
*  That's for sure. I talked to a manufacturing CEO about how the tariffs are affecting his business. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  He told me America could be sleepwalking into a small business apocalypse. Derek says, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=235.68s)]
*  let's say the tariffs on China stick around. How does your industry, the toy industry, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=243.28s)]
*  look different in three years? Molson Hart goes, if the tariffs don't go anywhere, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=248.4s)]
*  toys are the least of our worries. What about transformers and pumps and air conditioners? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  A lot of these products aren't really made anywhere but China. At a certain point, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=259.84s)]
*  the stock of replacement transformers, the replacement pumps that we need for clean water, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=265.28s)]
*  are going to run out. And there isn't anyone building new factories for those things. And [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=271.2s)]
*  the factories won't be ready in time. As for the toy industry, I mean, I'm not sure what's going [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=277.12s)]
*  to happen. But a lot of companies are definitely going to go under. That is for sure. We're hearing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=282.56s)]
*  about in Allentown, Pennsylvania, hundreds of workers now being laid off at two truck plants [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  in Pennsylvania and Maryland as company officials say orders are down amid market uncertainty. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=297.52s)]
*  Volvo Group North America confirmed to ABC 27 News that 250 to 350 people will be laid off [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=304.32s)]
*  from the Mack truck plants near Allentown, along with 50 to 100 people from the Volvo Mack [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=311.6s)]
*  Power Train plant in Maryland. Volvo owns Mack trucks and the plant manufactures engines, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=318.56s)]
*  transmissions, and drive trains for both. The reason why I was mentioning that Derek Thompson pod, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=326.24s)]
*  where they were talking about the transformers and the air conditioners and the pumps is because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=332.16s)]
*  they arrive, trucks take them from the ports and bring them across the country. But that's why you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  now have these blank sailings. Now, here's what I want to share with you. What was Donald Trump [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=344.4s)]
*  doing during his campaign? Here was a moment where Donald Trump was in Allentown, layoff central [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  right now for truck drivers. And here's what Donald Trump said to the truck drivers. And [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  apparently this worked. Apparently this was effective. Here, watch this clip. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=362.72s)]
*  Seriously? Seriously? I remember when Donald Trump was like walking to, remember he was cosplaying [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=381.36s)]
*  like he was a garbage truck driver. Remember he was doing that, the cosplay garbage truck [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=389.36s)]
*  driver? Play this clip. That's why we were telling you then that red flag, red flag, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  he cosplays these positions. And that's how you know who he screws over the most. When he does [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=411.76s)]
*  that cosplay, he's mocking you. He's not lifting you up. He's telling that he thinks that you're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=418.16s)]
*  pathetic. Let me show you another moment where Donald Trump said things that were similar here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=426.72s)]
*  Play this clip. These people are crazy. No, they want trucks to be all electric. The problem is [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=431.6s)]
*  they don't go far. That's a problem. You know what else is a problem? So the trucking industry comes [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=436.88s)]
*  to see me because they think I'm going to win and they come in to see me and these guys come in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=442.72s)]
*  and they're great guys. They've been in like Roger Penske. How good is Roger? The guy's won, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  but he's in the trucking business too. He's won like 19 Indianapolis five. Think of how good this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=453.36s)]
*  guy is. 85% of people have already crapped the bet on their resolutions, but you could still get [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=458.48s)]
*  your ass right by washing with the Tushy bidet. Listen, we all have our problems, but your cleanup [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  routine, that does not have to be one of them. That's where Tushy comes in. I've been using the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  Tushy Wave bidet and let me tell you, game changer. First off, installing it took me just [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=472.72s)]
*  10 minutes, no plumber needed. I'm telling you, if I could do it, anyone can. Tushy gives you a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=478.0s)]
*  refreshing, soothing cleanse with fresh water. Gets me cleaner, faster, without feeling like I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=483.12s)]
*  just sandpapered my backside. I'm telling you, once you go bidet, there is no other way. You like [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=488.0s)]
*  that? Tushy isn't just about feeling clean. It's about saving money, cutting down TP use by 80% [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  and protecting your skin. Plus, it looks sleek and fits perfectly in my bathroom. And every [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=499.76s)]
*  Hello Tushy bidet comes with a 30-day hassle-free return and a 12-month warranty. There's still time [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=505.44s)]
*  to get your ass right for life. For a limited time, our listeners get 10% off their first bidet [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=512.0s)]
*  order when you use code MIDAS at checkout. That's 10% off your first bidet order at [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=516.64s)]
*  HelloTushy.com with promo code MIDAS. HelloTushy.com promo code M-E-I-D-A-S. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=521.2s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just truck drivers, also just trucks that people drive in general. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=528.72s)]
*  The tariffs that are retaliatory from China to the US has effectively shut down [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=534.24s)]
*  the China market to the United States on basically everything. So Ford this week halted all [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=542.64s)]
*  shipments of its F-150 Raptors, Mustangs, and Michigan-built Bronco SUVs, as well as [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=548.64s)]
*  Kentucky-made Lincoln Navigators to China, the Wall Street Journal reported. This is bad, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=556.08s)]
*  but you know how, what was it, Kimberly Gargoyle said, the best is yet to come. The problem with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=563.76s)]
*  what's going on for truck drivers and frankly for all professions is that the worse and the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=570.72s)]
*  far worse is yet to come. Right now what we're experiencing, the volatility of the markets, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=577.92s)]
*  the days where it dips three, 4%, goes back up a little, dips some more, that volatility [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=584.88s)]
*  is actually nothing compared to why it is that Jerome Powell of the Chairman of the Federal [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=591.92s)]
*  Reserve and others are predicting dismal economic conditions. It's because there's a lag effect. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=599.36s)]
*  So what China's doing, what all these other countries are doing, what the, just think about [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=607.04s)]
*  the boycott from Canada and Europe, what that is doing, that's going to start being felt now in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=611.92s)]
*  April, May, June. And then what happens when one company defaults on its loans and multiple [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=618.48s)]
*  companies default on their loans, and then you have this domino effect of defaults, then what [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=624.16s)]
*  happens to the banks? This is a self-engineered great recession by the Trump regime that unless [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=630.0s)]
*  something miraculous happens is coming. And that's what all the economists see. And Donald Trump and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  his idiotic, vile, trash regime is there, you know, accordion hands acting like it's not. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=646.4s)]
*  And to the truck drivers out there, I have such great respect for you. I have such great respect [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=652.56s)]
*  for your profession. And you may not be one of those Trump voters, but I'm sure you know people [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=658.56s)]
*  who you hang out with who were. Show them this video. Show them the Midas Touch videos. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  Why? Why would you vote for someone whose entire history in life? Have your truck driver friends [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=670.64s)]
*  who like Trump go back and look at all of his bankruptcies where he screw over workers and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=676.88s)]
*  contractors and didn't give a shit. He's a bad guy who has hurt workers his whole life. Why do you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=682.0s)]
*  think this guy likes you? You're just his mark. You're just his mark. That's how he sees you, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjibxvYCWE&t=688.24s)]
