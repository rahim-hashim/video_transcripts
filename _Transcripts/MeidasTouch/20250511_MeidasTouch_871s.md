# Trump gets SMACKED DOWN in District HE FLIPPED…SCREWED!!
**MeidasTouch:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ)
*  Donald Trump's policies have wrecked cities and communities and counties across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to focus though on one in particular though that voted for Donald Trump in the biggest swing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=6.48s)]
*  since the 2020 election. So if you look at San Joaquin County in 2020, it was about a plus 13, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=14.16s)]
*  plus 14 Biden district. Biden beat Donald Trump in 2020. You look at the results in 2024 from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=23.04s)]
*  San Joaquin County, which is in California, it shifts to a Donald Trump give or take kind of plus [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=30.32s)]
*  one and a half plus two in favor of Donald Trump. So a 15 point swing from Biden to Trump and we're [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=37.2s)]
*  seeing repercussions, we're seeing consequences. Now, one of the first things that I think San [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=46.88s)]
*  Joaquin Valley felt in the county felt, Donald Trump released a water saying that he was going [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  to bring it to the fires in Southern California. When the Southern California fires were already [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=61.2s)]
*  fully contained. And so this is how it was reported in the Los Angeles Times, the water [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=67.76s)]
*  unexpectedly released from dams on Trump's order didn't help farms or a life. Days after Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=72.24s)]
*  startled some of his most ardent supporters of California's San Joaquin Valley by having the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  Army Corps of Engineers suddenly release water from two dams. Many in the region and beyond [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=84.08s)]
*  were still perplexed acting on an order from Washington. The Army Corps of Engineers allowed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  irrigation water to flow down to river channels for three days into the network of engineered [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=96.32s)]
*  waterways that fan out among farm fields in San Joaquin Valley, coursing from rivers to canals [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=101.52s)]
*  to irrigation ditches. Much of the water eventually made its way to retention basins where it soaked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=106.8s)]
*  into the ground, replenishing groundwater, which can be very damaging as well, though, during a dry [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=112.56s)]
*  summer when this water is supposed to be used for Army Corps of Engineers knew that Trump's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  California water release was going to be a waste and could be harmful to the farmers there. And [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  they did it anyway. And there's investigations going on there of what the heck happened. Also, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=130.56s)]
*  we're learning that the Trump regime's cuts could have devastating impacts on San Joaquin Valley's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=135.44s)]
*  health coverage with, think, 51% of the population there on Medi-Cal there. And as you go through, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=140.88s)]
*  you know, lots of these things, the tariffs and the trade wars and retaliation hurting the farmers, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=147.84s)]
*  this has had real world impacts. Votes matter. And I think people are feeling it there. You know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=154.16s)]
*  and I could go to different counties, but I wanted to focus on San Joaquin County in particular, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  because one of the biggest swings in the nation from Biden to Trump from 2020 to 2024, and now [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=166.24s)]
*  all of these consequences from trade wars to health care coverage to the dams, local issues [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=174.32s)]
*  are all being impacted. I want to bring on Democratic Congress member Josh Arter, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=179.68s)]
*  who's a Congress member from this district. And you're in a district now, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=184.8s)]
*  voted for Trump in the election. You're a Democrat who's won in this district. And so, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, you have constituents who split the votes. You know, they voted for you. They trust [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=196.56s)]
*  you, but they voted for Trump. Let's start off, Congressman, though, just what are you now seeing? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Are people regretting their votes? Are they confused? What's going on when you're getting [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=207.84s)]
*  calls from constituents? Nobody likes to say they made a mistake, but I do think there's a lot of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=212.64s)]
*  concern, anger, frustration over the last couple of months and how things have gone in the Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  administration. For an administration that campaigned relentlessly on bringing down the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=224.16s)]
*  cost of living, everything they've done has made life worse for folks just over the last couple [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=228.48s)]
*  of months, whether it's the trade wars that are hurting our farmers. You mentioned the two [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=234.72s)]
*  billion gallons of water that has been lost to our growers out here. People are really frustrated, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=239.84s)]
*  but just because they're being alienated by this administration doesn't mean we've yet won them [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=247.76s)]
*  back. I think the biggest theme that I've heard, not just over the last couple of months, but over [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=253.36s)]
*  years in the California Central Valley, is that voters are fed up by both parties and they want [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=257.2s)]
*  change in government to actually accommodate the needs that they see and they don't see it happening [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=263.84s)]
*  from anybody. When we talk about that, I mean, look, former President Biden didn't release two [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=268.64s)]
*  billions of gallons recklessly and maliciously. Had he done that, I think we'd may even see a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=276.32s)]
*  bigger story than what's taking place now. He wasn't the one who cut or is threatening to cut [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=285.52s)]
*  all of their Medicaid and take away health care from a large sizeable portion of the population [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=293.6s)]
*  in your district that relies on that for health care. He's not the one who's gutted their services [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  and started a reckless trade war against the world. In fact, under former President Biden, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=306.48s)]
*  you had 16.2 million jobs that were created. You had infrastructure projects that were probably [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=311.44s)]
*  beneficial to the district and throughout the country, record low unemployment. So talk [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  through that issue though, because when I'm looking at data on the one hand, I see somebody [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=323.28s)]
*  who delivered things and on the other hand, in a hundred days, I see people, not like a hypothetical [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  thing, I see literally ruining, if you're a farmer and you're getting screwed, but are they getting [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  pushed with like, oh, but I don't want, I mean, and this is somewhat near your area, I guess, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=346.0s)]
*  I'm going to get so angry at a transgender volleyball player on the bench of San Jose State [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=353.28s)]
*  that I'm going to go vote for someone to destroy my crops. It's hard for me to process that, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  but you're in the district. So you see what people are saying. What are you seeing? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  I think you're right. We had a lot of accomplishments in the Biden administration [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  that I think people just didn't feel in time. I voted for the infrastructure law now four years [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=376.56s)]
*  ago, because I thought it would help fix roads and bridges across our area four years along. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=383.76s)]
*  And one of the bridges in our community that has been decrepit, that is dangerous to drive on, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=389.04s)]
*  still hasn't been repaired. It could take another decade to actually get that project fixed. And I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=396.16s)]
*  think when people see a pothole or a bridge that needs to be repaired in their community, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=401.92s)]
*  they vote for somebody to fix it. And then years later, they don't see any progress. That breeds a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=406.24s)]
*  cynicism and a frustration that isn't necessarily anti-democrat or anti-Republican. It's just [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=410.64s)]
*  anti-government and anti-status quo. And I think a lot of voters here wanted change. They wanted to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=416.72s)]
*  shake up the system. Obviously, I think what we're seeing with Donald Trump isn't going to make [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=422.0s)]
*  anybody's life better over here. As you highlighted, half my district is on Medi-Cal. If this Republican [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  budget moves forward, 100,000 people that I represent are at risk of losing their health [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=432.32s)]
*  insurance for good. We'd see bankrupt hospitals. We'd see nursing homes close. And so I think [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=437.92s)]
*  you're right. People are pretty frustrated. And the answers that they're getting aren't anything [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=445.12s)]
*  like what they were actually promised during the campaign. So what do you think the answers are? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=449.52s)]
*  I mean, in theory, people like the concept of efficiency, but then Trump and Musk roll out Doge, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=453.6s)]
*  and it's actually made things less efficient. There's more federal spending, what they're doing [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=461.28s)]
*  in their attacks on the federal government, not just in the short term, adding to the deficit, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  but whoa, I'm sure when we do a five to 10 year look back, that could be in the trillions of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=472.96s)]
*  dollars in lost tax revenue and all of the dangers they created. They're secretly rehiring people [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  now who they fired. It's like, oh crap, we actually do need air traffic controllers. What are we going [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=483.52s)]
*  to do? So things are less efficient. But what's your solution? I mean, you see it firsthand. What [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=487.36s)]
*  do we do? I mean, how would Biden, you pass the law, how do you get the money into the hands to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=494.24s)]
*  deal with the pot? What do you suggest we do? I think one line that I hear a lot is that Trump is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=499.92s)]
*  the wrong answer to the right question. We do need more government efficiency. Obviously, what Doge [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=505.36s)]
*  has been doing over the last few months is the exact opposite of government efficiency, cutting [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=511.76s)]
*  cancer research and Alzheimer research, kicking people off their nutrition and cutting their health [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=516.32s)]
*  insurance is not going to make government more effective or more responsive. But I think we would [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=521.7600000000001s)]
*  be wrong as Democrats to just have knee jerk opposition to the idea behind Doge and the idea [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=527.2s)]
*  of government efficiency in general and say, hey, everything was absolutely perfect a couple months [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=534.0s)]
*  ago. Clearly, that's not true. That's not how voters across America feel. And so I think the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=538.32s)]
*  right thing to do is try to provide again, the right answer to that question, which I think is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=544.0s)]
*  at its heart. How do we make government more responsive, more effective and create some [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  urgency around getting projects across the finish line? The city of Pasadena in California came out [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  with a report last week where they said, you know, they want to put power lines underground in their [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  community to reduce wildfire risk. Sounds fantastic. Their estimate for how long it's going to take to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  get this done isn't next year. It's not five years or even 100 years. They told their voters [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=570.48s)]
*  it's going to take 500 years, 500 years for them to actually put power lines underground. That's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=576.16s)]
*  embarrassing and unacceptable. And we have to do better, especially in cities and states where [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=583.76s)]
*  Democrats have the majority already. So what we're trying to do is trying to make sure that we're [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  creating that urgency to make sure that we can build the solar plants we need, the housing that's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=594.0s)]
*  required and the infrastructure projects that are actually going to breed that optimism and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=598.88s)]
*  the dynamism that we need in the United States once again. Well, as someone who's from Pasadena, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=603.36s)]
*  hopefully I make it to those 500 years where I can get a vision power. My last question for you is [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=610.08s)]
*  that you've announced this bipartisan caucus. And it sounds great. When I think about [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=616.56s)]
*  bipartisanship though, in the age of Trump, I think of the image though of the MAGA Republicans [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=628.32s)]
*  not even debating issues during congressional hearings. Like I think of Democrats saying, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=637.36s)]
*  hey, let's discuss the budget and we discuss this amendment and literally the Republicans go silent [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=644.08s)]
*  and by and large, you know, their leadership, whether you're talking about the James Combers [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=651.36s)]
*  or the Jim Jordans or, you know, they'll get rid of the guy from the Intelligence Committee who was [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=655.6s)]
*  somewhat possible to work with bipartisan and pick someone who's more palatable to, you know, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=660.48s)]
*  to a Trump. So how do you work with people who at the end of the day, when Donald Trump makes the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=665.52s)]
*  posts of himself dressed as the Pope, they go, wherefore Pope? You know, California guy, when [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=674.08s)]
*  Donald Trump says reopen Alcatraz, oh, he's outside the box thinking, you know, it's got to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  frustrate you even when you're doing this, when you see people who you know may be rational, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=686.32s)]
*  reasonable people though, and they're like, well, we like out, you know, Alcatraz is a great idea. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=690.72s)]
*  It's like, no, it's not. Come on. It's not. Let's talk about serious things. Like, so how do you deal [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=695.36s)]
*  with them? Luckily, not every Republican in Congress is Marjorie Taylor Greene or Lauren Boebert. We do [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=699.28s)]
*  have, I think, a few rational folks, many rational folks left. And obviously, I think most voters [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=705.68s)]
*  want to see progress on these issues. You know, I got a bill done to address this invasive species [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=712.64s)]
*  that we have in California, this 50 pound swamp rat called Nutria that was taken over our wetlands. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  I ended up bringing a taxidermied swamp rat into the halls of Congress for the first time [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=725.12s)]
*  ever to show my folks what a 50 pound rat actually looks like in the wetlands of California. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=730.4s)]
*  I got that bill passed and 100% of Republicans ended up voting for it, including the most extreme [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=737.12s)]
*  Republicans anywhere in the country, folks that I didn't see eye to eye with on any other issue. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=743.52s)]
*  And that's helped save California hundreds of millions of dollars of avoided infrastructure [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=748.24s)]
*  losses. So, you know, look, I think we have to be able to try to at least attempt to find common [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=753.44s)]
*  ground. I think we can on at least some of these economic issues where Republican districts need [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=758.8s)]
*  to build housing too. They want the benefits of solar farms and wind farms and bridges and highways [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=763.5999999999999s)]
*  that are getting fixed. The current problems that we're facing aren't just in California, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  they're across the country. And so my hope is that we can create a little bit of a common sense. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=773.3599999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, I think that's going to be good for the country. And I think that's going to be [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=778.7199999999999s)]
*  good for the lives of folks who absolutely need this help and can't wait, you know, another four [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=781.92s)]
*  years for a different president or something else to happen. Yeah, you know, imagine if another [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=787.04s)]
*  president were to come in, Democrat, and rather than focusing on just being cruel and inhumane and [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  mean, we focused on building homes for everybody and the most efficient homes that have, you know, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=800.24s)]
*  that utilize all of this great stuff. And people don't have to work two jobs to be able to, you [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  know, afford rent. And we message that we deliver that homes, homes, homes, like, you know, anyway, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=814.72s)]
*  we got to we got to chat more because your district, I think we have to study it. We have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  to study it because when you flip plus 15 in another direction, something is happening. And [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=827.12s)]
*  and and we have we have to deal with it as as as people as humans who want to not have the situation [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfFWn1myqQ&t=834.88s)]
