# GOP Scheme TO STEAL Supreme Court seat BACKFIRES BIG TIME
**MeidasTouch:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk)
*  Carolina is still right here! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=0.0s)]
*  That right there was a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina for Justice Alison Riggs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=3.0s)]
*  You know, we've been covering this North Carolina Supreme Court race diligently here on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=15.96s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=22.0s)]
*  This was the race back in November of 2024 that Justice Riggs, pro-democracy, democratic [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=23.52s)]
*  judge running as a Democrat, won. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=31.68s)]
*  She beat Jefferson Griffin, the MAGA Republican. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=34.04s)]
*  There were two recounts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=36.96s)]
*  She won the first recount. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=38.54s)]
*  She won the second recount. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=40.36s)]
*  But you see, the MAGA Republican Jefferson Griffin wouldn't take the fact that he lost [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  as a loss. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Then he filed lawsuits everywhere before the Court of Appeals where he is a Court of Appeals [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  judge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  He actually won before his own court, the Court of Appeals, although he was not on the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  panel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=59.76s)]
*  Then it went to the Supreme Court very recently. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=60.76s)]
*  Last week there was a mixed ruling there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  You see Jefferson Griffin wanted to throw out 65,000 votes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=65.96s)]
*  The Supreme Court basically said that 5,000 are subject to Jefferson Griffin's ridiculous [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  challenge after losing, and those were military votes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=77.18s)]
*  There's a recent update that it may be a less amount than those 5,000 that are actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=81.06s)]
*  going to be subject to the Supreme Court's ruling. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=86.82s)]
*  I've heard a few different things, but somewhere in the range of 1,600 or 1,675 votes that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=89.3s)]
*  are now subject to the Supreme Court's ruling. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=95.82s)]
*  So at least there are some positive developments there, but I don't think we should take anything [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=98.94s)]
*  for granted where you have a MAGA Republican Congress member, MAGA Republican justice, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=103.92s)]
*  and MAGA Republican people who are all very focused on trying to take this election where [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  they lost. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=114.88s)]
*  Justice Riggs won. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=116.36s)]
*  That's the story. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=117.36s)]
*  There should be someone conceding, the loser in this case, Jefferson Griffin, with dignity, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=118.9s)]
*  but that's not what he did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=123.84s)]
*  This is a playbook I think we're going to be seeing across the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=125.36s)]
*  It needs to be taken seriously. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=128.84s)]
*  Justice Allison Riggs to give us an update on the latest. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=131.48s)]
*  Justice Riggs, you've been fighting for what the people did. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=135.82s)]
*  They voted for you, and this has been a long, arduous, expensive process for you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  So where are we right now? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=146.04s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Ben. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  It's a delight to be here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=150.04s)]
*  This is a rapidly changing situation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=151.78s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=154.0s)]
*  It does seem like the scope of voters impacted is shrinking, but I need folks to know, one, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=155.16s)]
*  that my opponent is not accepting that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=163.6s)]
*  He wants more voters impacted, more voters potentially disenfranchised. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=166.32s)]
*  And two, this fight, a cure process going underway to chase and cure only 16, 1700 ballots [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=172.16s)]
*  is better in terms of the number of voters potentially disenfranchised, but it's just [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=185.55999999999997s)]
*  as toxic for our democracy, because this sets a precedent that could be used anywhere in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  this country, will be used everywhere in this country, which is if a candidate or a party [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  is disappointed with who wins, they can go and look at the election laws that were on [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=203.56s)]
*  the books as of election day, the rules and the laws that people relied on and the rules [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  they followed, and they can say, hmm, if I challenge this law, maybe enough votes are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=215.48s)]
*  impacted voters who were against me to change the outcome of an election. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=221.76s)]
*  So the threat to democracy is existential. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=227.08s)]
*  If this happens here, we will not be able to contain it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=231.76s)]
*  And so I am fighting tooth and nail, one, because one voter disenfranchised is too many. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=236.8s)]
*  We enjoy the fundamental right to vote. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=242.96s)]
*  The federal constitution prohibits changing the rules of an election after the election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=246.32s)]
*  And really, we all should be offended that our service members and their families are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=252.04s)]
*  being targeted in the way they are, because the people who raise their hand to serve shouldn't [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=258.0s)]
*  be the first in line to lose their ballot if they happen to be coming from a Democratic [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=265.44s)]
*  county. That's just not right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=271.48s)]
*  I come from a military family. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=274.0s)]
*  I'm proud of my family's service. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=276.04s)]
*  And I will fight for the people like my dad who served. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=278.4s)]
*  It's the very least I can do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=283.72s)]
*  So what's particularly nefarious here and why this can be a playbook for autocracy across [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=286.56s)]
*  the country, what the MAGA Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin did, too, was after he lost [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=293.16s)]
*  the election, after he lost recount one, recount two, he then went on this process to challenge [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=298.8s)]
*  votes, but he targeted Democratic areas and he targeted only this race. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=306.08s)]
*  So it wasn't like, oh, there are all of these issues in North Carolina that affect all of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=313.08s)]
*  the races. No, no, no. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=319.2s)]
*  What we should just focus on are certain Democratic leaning areas, certain groups and classes [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=320.6s)]
*  of people in this race only don't challenge the stuff relating to Trump or Republican [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=327.68s)]
*  Congress members who won. That was fine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=334.56s)]
*  That must be OK. But here, as it relates to an area where they lost and otherwise, look, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  let's face it, in November, they had a pretty good election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they lost the governor's race, but in the national level, they won the presidency. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=346.44s)]
*  You know, so but where they're challenging is you, Democratic areas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  And if you can do that there, then anybody can try to reverse engineer elections, then [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  rely on, you know, are people going to even hear about this news and the process, you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  know, and then just try to just pick off election after election after election. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  That was that was what stood out for me about. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=374.48s)]
*  And your election, you were a former election lawyer before becoming a Supreme Court [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=376.44s)]
*  justice. So what do you make of that? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=381.08s)]
*  I mean, we we've seen this happening in 2020 and 2022. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  This isn't new. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=387.8s)]
*  I think the strategy is this cycle. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=389.56s)]
*  Well, there weren't that many close elections nationally. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=392.8s)]
*  So we invested in these strategies to fight election results that national Republicans [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=397.16s)]
*  didn't like. And so let's see what we can do in a state Supreme Court race in one state, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=405.48s)]
*  because they you know, folks who would dismiss the will of voters really only needed to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=412.64s)]
*  work once to be able to replicate it and hone it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  And even though, you know, good judges from both parties were in part responsible for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=422.4s)]
*  the efforts to overturn the 2020 election from failing, we know that, you know, folks [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=429.96s)]
*  just won't give up. And I really I have seen the damage that election denialism and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=438.2s)]
*  misinformation and disinformation has done to trust in our election systems. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=446.88s)]
*  I've seen election officials that, you know, I when I was in a nonpartisan civil rights [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=453.28s)]
*  job, these were people I worked with closely to help run elections and they've been [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  threatened, had their lives threatened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=466.32s)]
*  So I've seen firsthand before I joined the bench, the damage that's being done. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=469.2s)]
*  And I don't want voters or even national viewers to think, oh, well, because the margin of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  voters impacted has shrunk so much that she's likely to win. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=481.88s)]
*  I don't want people to make any assumptions on that, because it really shouldn't matter. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=486.48s)]
*  A candidate's ground game six months after the election that should not come into play. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=492.64s)]
*  I won on Election Day, voters cast their ballot, then they decided I do have a great [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=499.68s)]
*  ground game and we will if we have to touch all of those voters. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's, you know, it's six months after an election. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=510.88s)]
*  People are have moved on. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=513.88s)]
*  They're they're not worried about it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=515.76s)]
*  And these are overseas military deployed voters. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=517.28s)]
*  So these are folks who are hard to get in touch with, are not necessarily thinking there [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=521.12s)]
*  was any problem with their ballot. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=526.4s)]
*  They didn't cast a provisional ballot. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=528.16s)]
*  They used a longstanding federal law and a federal law and federal pathway for voting [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=530.52s)]
*  that and they were told they did not need to copy their ID and send it in through a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=538.4s)]
*  portal that didn't even have an option for doing that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  So long winded way of saying I need folks to stay really plugged in on this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=548.88s)]
*  I have not dialed this down one ounce. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  I am fighting incredibly hard to stop this process from even starting this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=558.88s)]
*  They're calling it a cure process, but cure implies there was something wrong with these [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  ballots. There was not. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fks61XgoBk&t=568.92s)]
