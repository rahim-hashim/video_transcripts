# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump LOSES CONTROL
**MeidasTouch:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs)
*  All hell is breaking loose in the United States because of the pathetic tantrums of man-baby [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=6.72s)]
*  Let me just talk to you about charts, graphs, objective data, not the BS that Donald Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=7.72s)]
*  and MAGA spews. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  All hell is breaking loose because of this felon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=17.2s)]
*  Let's take a look at this chart right here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=20.64s)]
*  The 30-year mortgage rate has now jumped to 7.5%, one of the highest levels in the entire [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=22.8s)]
*  century. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  Apple is now one of the worst performing Magnificent 7 stocks, the worst in 2025, with a year-to-date [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  decline of 22%. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  And that's because the man-baby Donald Trump woke up in the morning yesterday and attacked [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=44.32s)]
*  Apple directly, of America's biggest companies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=50.24s)]
*  And Donald Trump said he wanted to impose a tariff on Apple. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump also said he wanted to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union, which effectively [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  would be an embargo on doing business with the European Union. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=67.88s)]
*  That caused our markets to tank. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=72.76s)]
*  Now, this follows, of course, Donald Trump imposing 145% tariffs against China, which [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=76.0s)]
*  then he sent Scott Bessent and his other trade representative, Jameson Greer, to Switzerland [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=82.56s)]
*  to totally capitulate and cave to China and reduced 145% tariffs to 30% tariffs, by the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=90.64s)]
*  way, which is still high. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  And container shipping and shipments are still very low right now in the United States of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=100.0s)]
*  America. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=105.36s)]
*  Let's talk about Treasury bonds. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=106.36s)]
*  U.S. Treasury bonds now have the worst 10-year rolling annualized returns in the last 90 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=108.44s)]
*  years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=116.76s)]
*  The 30-year Treasury yields are over 5%. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=117.76s)]
*  When you look at the 10 and 20, they're rising in ways that demonstrate a great deal of volatility [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=122.12s)]
*  in the United States markets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=129.4s)]
*  You want to talk about groceries, you want to talk about prices. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=131.52s)]
*  Ground beef hits new all-time highs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=135.48s)]
*  You want to talk about the markets. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=139.48s)]
*  Yesterday, a disastrous day on Wall Street, the Dow down nearly 1%, the S&P down as well, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  and the Nasdaq was down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=149.72s)]
*  All of the indexes were down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=151.28s)]
*  It was not a good day on the market. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=153.48s)]
*  As Justin Wolf says, Trump's tariff threat on Apple knocked its stock down 2.75%, which [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=156.92s)]
*  for a company valued at nearly $3 trillion amounts to a destruction of $80 billion of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=166.4s)]
*  value. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=173.68s)]
*  Or to put this in more human terms, it's an effective tax of nearly $250 per every American. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=174.68s)]
*  As I mentioned, this data comes from Apollo. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=184.6s)]
*  Sorry if I'm geeking out with the charts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=187.04s)]
*  When I say all hell is breaking loose, I'm trying to warn us what the hell is happening [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  as the pathetic man-baby-felon sexual abuser. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=196.44s)]
*  Donald Trump continues to do things that ravage our economy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=201.12s)]
*  Apollo explains the lack of a rebound in container traffic after the China-U.S. trade. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=205.92s)]
*  They call it a deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=213.68s)]
*  It's really a consensus. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=214.68s)]
*  On May 12, is worrying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=216.44s)]
*  Worrying would be an understatement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=219.68s)]
*  Want to talk about worrying being an understatement? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=222.44s)]
*  We all know that on Thursday, Donald Trump held his crypto meme coin dinner to enrich [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=225.56s)]
*  himself and his family, where he invited all of these people who each paid at least basically [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  a million dollars to personally buy Trump meme coins. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=239.88s)]
*  Some people paid $15, $16, $20 million to be there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=243.56s)]
*  I'm going to do a whole other video on this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=248.6s)]
*  Donald Trump gave them the grossest piece of steak also, maybe because beef prices have [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=250.96s)]
*  hit an all-time high. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=257.4s)]
*  And a salad that looks like it was vomited out of a ... Well, I won't even go there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=260.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=265.8s)]
*  What was JD Vance talking about at the U.S. Naval Academy? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=267.12s)]
*  Again, I don't like hyperbole. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  When I say all hell is breaking loose, I mean it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=274.26s)]
*  This is what RT, Russian TV, Russian propaganda is promoting JD Vance's speech at the U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  Naval Academy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=288.4s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=290.36s)]
*  JD Vance said that the United States is no longer a dominant power in the world. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=292.92s)]
*  The era of uncontested U.S. dominance is over, and he warns U.S. Naval Academy graduates [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=299.0s)]
*  that Russia and China are determined to beat U.S. in every domain. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  JD Vance at the Naval Academy is literally cooking up Russian propaganda that Russia [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  is propagandizing and showing to their people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=318.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=322.0s)]
*  The era of uncontested U.S. dominance is over. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=323.0s)]
*  Today we face serious threats in China, Russia, and other nations determined to beat us in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  every single domain. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=333.32s)]
*  From spectrum to low Earth orbit to our supply chains and even our communication infrastructure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  Technology has lowered the cost of disruption, and so we must be, all of us, not just smarter, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=343.04s)]
*  we got to make sure that we send our troops to war, we do it with the right tools. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, while all of this is going on, I'll do a whole other video on this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=358.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is deleting the transcripts of himself because he's so incoherent and he [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  can't put together sentences anymore. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=371.16s)]
*  That on the transcript section of the White House website, delete, delete, delete, delete. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=373.88s)]
*  They put up some like YouTube videos of him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=380.16s)]
*  No, we the people deserve to see the transcripts, and we can make a determination if you even [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=382.8s)]
*  know how to put together a sentence. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=388.88s)]
*  When I say all hell is breaking loose, it's also because Donald Trump denied supplemental [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=392.18s)]
*  FEMA aid to North Carolina once again. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=398.24s)]
*  We've been very focused on the Midas Touch Network of FEMA because I know in hurricane [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=401.68s)]
*  season this is going to be the biggest story. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=408.16s)]
*  It should already be a massive story that the Trump regime fired all of these workers [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=410.36s)]
*  from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency and the National Weather Service, and all [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  these people lost their jobs, so they're no longer even have the staffing to be able [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=421.32s)]
*  to provide proper weather forecasts and warnings. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=426.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's a pretty big freaking deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=429.74s)]
*  On the FEMA side, FEMA has been late and slow to respond to significant events, weather [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=432.74s)]
*  events, tornadoes, like hundreds of tornadoes already. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=439.98s)]
*  In the past week, week and a half, over about 30 Americans died in Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=443.22s)]
*  and Indiana. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=452.58s)]
*  Trump makes no statement about it and where the hell is FEMA? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=453.92s)]
*  By the way, FEMA still hasn't showed up in Mississippi and in Arkansas and in all of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=459.0s)]
*  these other states who are suffering from prior storms even before that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=464.12s)]
*  Then FEMA just denied supplemental aid to North Carolina. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=469.04s)]
*  They denied supplemental aid a few weeks or a month or two ago in Georgia. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=472.64s)]
*  Of course, they denied aid to Kentucky. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  What this also means is that states don't have the resources to do this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump's going to be bankrupting states and he's going to be bankrupting red states also. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=483.48s)]
*  But folks, while all hell breaks loose, the man-baby felon, sexual abuser fraud, you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=488.44s)]
*  know what he's doing? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=493.92s)]
*  Golfing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=495.16s)]
*  He's vacationing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=496.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=497.16s)]
*  Because he hates America. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=498.16s)]
*  He hates Americans. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=499.86s)]
*  This selfish, vile piece of disgusting trash is golfing while he lights the United States [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=501.58000000000004s)]
*  of America on fire, while he and JD Vance provide propaganda for Russia and China to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=509.56s)]
*  use against us. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=516.96s)]
*  As they've weakened and crushed the United States, Donald Trump and Vance, as they've [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=518.84s)]
*  capitulated to Russia, peace in 24 hours in Ukraine, nah, these pathetic, weak, vile fools. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=523.88s)]
*  Donald Trump and JD Vance, not only just MIA, complicit with, I think they're just straight [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=532.16s)]
*  up rooting for Russia at this point. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=538.34s)]
*  They're no longer even holding negotiations. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  They're done. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=542.5s)]
*  They said, hey, Russia and Ukraine, you deal with it together. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=543.5s)]
*  In other words, they're giving a green light to Russia. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=546.22s)]
*  Despicable, vile people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=549.3s)]
*  And you know, as the Trump regime continues to disappear, human beings continues to disappear [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=551.58s)]
*  people here in the United States, is it any wonder why travel from Europe to the United [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=557.26s)]
*  States is down 25%? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=562.5s)]
*  It's even more than that in Canada, Australia. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=564.98s)]
*  All across the world. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=568.14s)]
*  No one wants to be in the United States right now because remember how Donald Trump would [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=569.14s)]
*  refer to other countries as shithole and hellholes? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=572.98s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump was intent on turning the United States the way he has shithole companies, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=576.1s)]
*  trying to turn the United States into that as well. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=582.1s)]
*  You see the story right here of the 19-year-old girl, Jimena. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=585.4399999999999s)]

*  My wife is from Mexico. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=595.02s)]
*  It's when I saw the story of the Trump regime throwing a 19-year-old girl from Georgia, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=596.18s)]
*  college student named Jimena in a detention center for weeks and weeks and weeks, basically [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=601.3s)]
*  torturing her. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=608.46s)]
*  She was just released finally. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=610.26s)]
*  Here's her story. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=612.8199999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=613.8199999999999s)]

*  It's life-changing and yeah, I wouldn't wish it on anybody. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=618.78s)]
*  And here she is again. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=623.7s)]
*  Let me show one more clip of her right here. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=624.7s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=626.74s)]
*  I was terrified. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=628.7s)]
*  And then as I was being transported down to Stewart, I stopped at some offices in Atlanta [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=630.34s)]
*  and they had me in a room by myself for nine hours. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=637.0200000000001s)]
*  I didn't know what was going on. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=640.62s)]
*  The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature has a huge impact on your [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=642.7800000000001s)]

*  And then they go on, as I said, all hell breaks loose. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=761.52s)]
*  Of course, you know by now the Trump regime attacking Harvard University, saying that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=764.72s)]
*  if you're an international student, you can't attend Harvard or else you'll get deported. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=770.72s)]
*  You'll go to the concentration camps in El Salvador or Libya or South Sudan or wherever [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=775.88s)]
*  the hell. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=780.92s)]
*  Maybe they'll send you back to the country. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=781.92s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=782.92s)]
*  Now, maybe they'll disappear. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=783.92s)]
*  Who the hell knows with this despicable regime? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=784.92s)]
*  But Harvard sued right away, and Harvard won a preliminary injunction against the Trump [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=787.8s)]
*  regime. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=793.16s)]
*  I started with data. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=794.48s)]
*  I started with data. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=795.8399999999999s)]
*  Let me take a look at this data. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  The disastrous budget bill, it literally steals. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=799.0s)]
*  Literally steals. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=802.8s)]
*  If you make between zero and $51,000, about $1,000 from you gets stolen and gets given [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=804.92s)]
*  to rich people. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=812.4s)]
*  People who make more than $4.3 million are going to save close to $400,000 from this [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=814.24s)]
*  disastrous bill. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=820.36s)]
*  Then people who make between zero and $51,000 will have $1,000 stolen from them to be given [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=822.24s)]
*  to the rich people. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=828.2800000000001s)]
*  Mind you, this doesn't even get into that analysis. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  It's just at the most basic level, unlike the actual payment of taxes, raising the taxes, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=832.96s)]
*  literally taking money and giving it to the rich as the rich get the big tax cuts. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=838.4000000000001s)]
*  The billionaires and decamillionaires get the tax cuts. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=843.0s)]
*  Then also taking people, 14 million people will lose their healthcare, lose Supplemental [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=845.76s)]
*  Nutrition Assistance Program, will destroy their livelihood and jobs. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=851.48s)]
*  This thing is an absolute, absolute disaster. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=855.84s)]
*  Remember, I talked about FEMA before. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=858.2s)]
*  It's really important that I do because the experts, and experts matter, are predicting [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=860.56s)]
*  that warm waters and storm-friendly climate patterns, because climate change is real, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=866.62s)]
*  It's expected to produce as many as 19 tropical storms, including six to ten hurricanes, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=872.72s)]
*  government scientists said on Thursday. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=879.84s)]
*  That's going to be disastrous as FEMA is not going to be ready. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=883.1600000000001s)]
*  I keep warning about the mass casualty events that are going to happen if we have big hurricanes [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=886.84s)]
*  this season, and we expect that to take place. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=892.9200000000001s)]
*  I know no one else is really raising the alarm the way we are. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=895.32s)]
*  I keep talking about this over and over again for a reason. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=898.28s)]
*  In that disastrous budget bill, it got rid of all of the climate tax credits for Americans, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=902.6s)]
*  phased them out, all of the clean energy jobs, all of these jobs that employed millions of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=908.16s)]
*  Americans are going to be gone, and people are going to lose their jobs. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a reason, though, why China and Europe are also focused on green jobs. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=919.52s)]
*  One, their people demand it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=923.4s)]
*  They're science and fact-based. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=925.2s)]
*  Two, they know that this is the future. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=926.72s)]
*  They're creating the jobs of the future today. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=930.28s)]
*  They look at the jobs that were here in the United States. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=934.6s)]
*  They wanted those jobs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=937.36s)]
*  Because Trump's unleashing hell in the United States, Trump looked at the low-paying factory [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=941.04s)]
*  jobs and because Trump's view of low-income people is that, and this is what they've said [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=945.28s)]
*  to the regime, oh yeah, they want to work in the factories their entire life, and then [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  generations of them can work in factories. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=954.24s)]
*  No, they want high-paying jobs. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=956.48s)]
*  They were looking for high-paying jobs, but the Trump regime looks at low-income people. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=959.04s)]
*  They love working in the coal mines and love working in the factories. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=962.84s)]
*  No, the American dream is to have a wage and get paid with dignity, but also they want [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=966.4s)]
*  other things for their families as well. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=973.16s)]
*  Go listen to it, have conversations with people. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=975.2s)]
*  I'm not going to play any Trump videos on this. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=978.4s)]
*  You get it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=981.68s)]
*  I mean, I'll tell you what he said. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=982.68s)]
*  I just don't want to even hear his, I don't want to hear his freaking voice right now, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=984.12s)]
*  but Donald Trump was asked at the press conference yesterday, why are you imposing tariffs on [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=988.12s)]
*  Apple? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=993.6s)]
*  You're trying to hurt American businesses? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=994.6s)]
*  You're causing an $80 billion market cap loss from Apple? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=996.96s)]
*  They're not hurting, they're helping. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1001.04s)]
*  The pathetic vile man-baby felon said, the reporter to Donald Trump, is there anything [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1003.36s)]
*  the EU can do to avoid 50% tariffs that you're threatening in your morning tantrum, man-baby? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1008.28s)]
*  I added that last part. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1014.04s)]
*  Trump, I don't know. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1015.04s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1016.64s)]
*  Right now, June 1st, whatever, I'm going to do it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1017.72s)]
*  Just so utterly, utterly pathetic. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1021.84s)]
*  Oh, and then Donald Trump was asked about Harvard. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1024.48s)]
*  He's like, they don't know how to do math there. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1027.0s)]
*  They don't know basic, they don't know two plus two equals four. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1029.44s)]
*  What a clown show, what a gong show. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1033.08s)]
*  How ridiculous could this possibly be? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1035.76s)]
*  What a pathetic, pathetic human being him and his regime are. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1039.34s)]
*  Just call them out what they are. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtQO-4WwEs&t=1042.32s)]
