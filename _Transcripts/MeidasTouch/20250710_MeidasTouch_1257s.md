# WHOA! Total CHAOS ERUPTS in Senate at LIVE CROSS EXAM
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ)
*  You're wasting everybody's time, Senator. You're a whack job. Senator, you are a waste. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I think we are. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=6.0s)]
*  You are a next level whack job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=7.0s)]
*  Yep. So complete chaos broke loose at various Senate hearings yesterday. You saw right there, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=9.28s)]
*  Maggay Republican, Senator Kennedy cross-examining Richard Painter on a crypto bill. Painter is a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=15.6s)]
*  ethics lawyer who used to work in the White House about 15 or 20 years ago or so. Painter wants to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=24.08s)]
*  make sure there's transparency in crypto. I'll show you more of that in a moment. I want to show you [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=31.68s)]
*  what else went down in the Senate right here. You had a lot of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  testifying and they didn't know the most basic, basic facts about the country that they are an [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  ambassador for. You would think that they would just do some minimal homework and just study [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=51.2s)]
*  some basic facts. You think if you were about to testify before the Senate about your confirmation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=55.84s)]
*  to be an ambassador, you'd learn about the country. Ah, that's just me. So here, Democratic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=60.88s)]
*  Senator Tammy Duckworth called out Trump's ambassador to Singapore for being completely [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=66.16s)]
*  unprepared and clueless here. Watch this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=71.68s)]
*  What does holding the Austrian chairmanship entail for Singapore? Can you name one thing? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=75.04s)]
*  A role that they would have to play as Austrian chair. What will? Well, there, you know that, that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=82.16s)]
*  there, uh, this is a, this, the Austrian chair is not only one country. There are 10 countries. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=86.48s)]
*  No, the Austrian chair is one country. One country, but there are 10 countries involved as an [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=93.76s)]
*  Austrian group. You're not answering my question. You're not answering my question, sir. Can you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=98.08s)]
*  name one thing that will be of critical importance to Singapore as Austrian chair? A role. There are [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=103.68s)]
*  many things. Can you name one defense economics? Those are very broad name, name an issue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=110.64s)]
*  Trade. I don't think no. Okay. Let's, let's do something. In what way does the United States [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=118.72s)]
*  Navy work with Singapore and how do you envision strengthening the U S Navy's work with Singapore? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=126.64s)]
*  And are there any facilities that come to mind that are central to our relationship with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=130.72s)]
*  Singapore? We thank you for your question, but we have a naval presence in Singapore and we, our, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=134.4s)]
*  our military, they always do exercise with the Singapore. The, they come here, the army of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=142.8s)]
*  Singapore, they come here for the training as well. So we have a close ties with the Singapore [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=149.6s)]
*  in defense. Can you name a specific thing? Please, I'm trying to help you here, but you've not even [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=154.88s)]
*  done your homework, sir. You want to be ambassador to Singapore. I'm one of the most important [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=161.12s)]
*  alliances friends we have in the Indo-Pacific, a key place that we're going to be fighting against [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  our greatest adversary in the region, the PRC Singapore may feature incredible culture, but that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=171.6s)]
*  should not be treated as a glamour posting. This nation is too important to United States, to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=177.28s)]
*  ASEAN, to the entire region. And frankly, I think the mission is important to us interest and national [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=182.0s)]
*  security. And it should actually be a foreign service officer, but I have even larger concerns [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=187.44s)]
*  with the political pick when that political pick is somebody as unqualified as you. I've opposed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=191.84s)]
*  political picks for Singapore from Democrats. So this is not a, this is not a partisan issue. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=196.88s)]
*  I just feel that you are not taking this seriously. And you think this is a glamour posting that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=202.0s)]
*  you're going to live a nice life in Singapore, but what we need is someone who's going to actually [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=206.32s)]
*  do the work. I am out of time. I have a couple of additional questions related to management that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=209.44s)]
*  I'll submit for the record, but I want to reinforce again for you right now. You are not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=214.56s)]
*  currently prepared for this posting period and you need to shape up and do some homework. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=218.4s)]
*  Okay. Next you had Kimberly Guilfoyle. Yes. Don Jr's ex fiance or girlfriend who was shipped out [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=222.16s)]
*  to Greece after Don Jr got a new girlfriend. And here she is in her opening statement. This is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  completely absurd. Let's play it. It is with great and profound sense of honor and deep humility that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=237.52s)]
*  I appear before you today as president Trump's nominee to serve as the United States ambassador [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=242.96s)]
*  to Greece. I extend my sincerest gratitude to the president for his faith in my abilities and to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  secretary Rubio and to Sergio Gore here present today, the head of PPO and his amazing team for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=255.52s)]
*  their collective trust and confidence placed in me. I also thank this committee for the opportunity [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  to be here and for your careful consideration of my nomination. All right. Let me show you now [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=268.72s)]
*  the full context of that exchange between MAGA Republican Senator Kennedy and Richard Painter, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  the ethics lawyer over this crypto bill here play this clip. Mr. Painter, do you think Senator [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=282.48s)]
*  Gillibrand is a crook? No, and I do not think all politicians are crooks. And why did you call her [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  a crook? I did not call her a crook. Now, Senator, you need to focus on this bill. You're doing this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=295.92s)]
*  again. You did it the last hearing. You need to read the bill. You published a tweet that said Senator Gillibrand's role [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  in stable corn regulation, $217,000 in crypto donations. You tweeted that. Yes, I do. And then you said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=307.92s)]
*  the crypto industry is buying Congress and the White House. This won't end well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Why do you think the crypto industry is buying Senator Gillibrand? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=322.88s)]
*  I said look at the campaign contributions from this industry. You think they've bothered? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=328.56s)]
*  I said look at the campaign contributions. You said they've bothered. Do you think they've bothered? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator, you need to focus on this bill instead of trying to distort my Twitter. Last time, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=337.28s)]
*  you were quoting what a Marxist in Chicago said about me. And what evidence do you have to see the crook? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=342.0s)]
*  I said there are massive amount of campaign contributions coming into this Congress from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=348.48s)]
*  the crypto industry. Do you want to apologize to Senator Gillibrand? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=354.32s)]
*  I do not want you to have to apologize for passing legislation that destroys our economy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=358.0s)]
*  You are distorting what I said just like you did in the last hearing. You're wasting everybody's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=364.16s)]
*  time, Senator. You're a whack job. Senator, you are a waste of everyone's next level whack job. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  Is this middle school, Senator? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=378.0s)]
*  Senator and witness, thank you both for your part. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=379.68s)]
*  I think you should apologize, Senator. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=382.4s)]
*  I think Senator, you're wasting our time. This is not middle school. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  Just to give you a little bit of background about where Richard Painter was coming from, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=387.12s)]
*  if you're just confused what happened in that clip I just showed you. Painter said the day before [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  this clip, at the hearing tomorrow on the Clarity Act, I will urge federal regulation aimed at safe [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  and transparent trading in crypto markets enacted and implemented by federal officials [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=402.0s)]
*  free of financial conflicts of interest, and that includes the president. He shows, for example, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=407.84s)]
*  how the Trump meme coin was worth $45.47 on January 19th, 2025, and then yesterday it was $8.73. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=413.92s)]
*  Who made money on this meme coin? He says, well, we know Trump made money on the meme coin. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=425.84s)]
*  We know the insiders make money on the meme coin. We know Trump earns transaction fees on the meme [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=430.56s)]
*  coin. So that's who makes money on the meme coin right there. But I wanted to give you context just [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=436.4s)]
*  what that exchange was about because you have a lot of senators. And by the way, there are some [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=441.52s)]
*  Democratic senators and Democratic Congress members who take a lot of money from crypto. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=445.76s)]
*  Also, it's not just purely the mega Republicans, although there's more mega Republicans. And look, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=450.16s)]
*  my own view of it is, is that there is a place for crypto and Bitcoin, and we should modernize, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=455.2s)]
*  and we should embrace crypto and Bitcoin. But we've got to do it in a very transparent way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  And we can't have politicians abusing their power. I think we have to treat crypto as though it is a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=465.36s)]
*  security so that it could be regulated like stocks. There has to be a regulation scheme so people [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  aren't scamming other people. And we see too often, especially with Trump meme coins and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=478.4s)]
*  Melania meme coins and a lot of these mega meme coins that they are scams. All right, going back [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=483.84s)]
*  to Democratic Senator Duckworth, who's just ripping to shreds this ambassador to Singapore. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=488.96s)]
*  He doesn't know the most basic things here. He doesn't even know what the amount of the trade [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=495.84s)]
*  surpluses between the United States and Singapore. Here, watch this. I have my doubts. So my questions [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=501.52s)]
*  are going to be to allow you to assuage my doubts and win my vote. Dr. Sena, I need to know that you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=506.64s)]
*  understand some basic facts about Singapore and its critical relationship with the United States. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=512.88s)]
*  For example, in 2024, did the United States have a trade deficit with Singapore? Yes or no? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=517.68s)]
*  It did not. How large was the US's trade surplus with Singapore in 2024? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=524.88s)]
*  $80 billion. $18 billion. $2.8 billion. You're off by a huge factor. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=531.12s)]
*  The United States had a $2.8 billion trade surplus with Singapore in 2024. If confirmed, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=538.4s)]
*  how would you explain our friendship in Singapore to the President? How would you explain to our [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  friends in Singapore the President's threats to slap tariffs as high as 25% on their country, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=549.52s)]
*  given that the United States has nearly $3 billion trade surplus with Singapore? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you for your question, Senator. We are not walking away for any [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=560.0s)]
*  dialogue between the two countries and two leaders. If confirmed, I will make a personal relation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=564.72s)]
*  with the government of Singapore and I will make sure the dialogue continues and we settle [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=572.0s)]
*  the issues of trade together. Do you support increasing a tariff on Singapore, seeing as how [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=579.2s)]
*  we don't have a... They buy more of our stuff than we buy of theirs. So you want to put a tariff on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=585.04s)]
*  them? Thank you for your question, Senator. You know that the President has only done 10% of trade [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=591.04s)]
*  increase with Singapore and he's open to dialogue even for that. Do you agree with that 10% increase [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  with Singapore? It seems how they don't have a surplus with us. Well, I... Yes or no? Do you [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  support the President's plan to put a 10% tariff on Singapore, goods produced in Singapore? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=618.72s)]
*  I mean, Senator, thank you for your question, but I believe in President's decision of a free trade [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=624.08s)]
*  with any nations in the world and he's resetting the trade numbers with each country and he's open [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=634.72s)]
*  for discussion and dialogue with each country. So you would like to have free trade with Singapore? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=644.56s)]
*  That's what you would push for as ambassador? Well, we always had free trade with Singapore [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=649.3599999999999s)]
*  since 2004. So do you support the 10% tariff increase? The dialogue is not yet closed. The [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  door is not closed. Let's go on to the next thing. You ever realize how ridiculous your old wallet [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=664.4799999999999s)]
*  was after you finally upgrade? I used to carry around this bulky beat up leather brick that [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  barely fit in my pocket, cards falling out, cash crumbled up. I generally think it hurt my back. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=673.04s)]
*  Then I found Ridge and I've been obsessed ever since. I love my Ridge wallet. It is slim, sleek, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=678.16s)]
*  and somehow holds up to 12 cards plus cash, all in this incredibly compact modern design. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=684.24s)]
*  Mine is the sea glass aluminum version and I've gotten so many compliments on it. No joke. These [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=689.76s)]
*  are built with premium materials like aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber. This thing will never [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=695.12s)]
*  fall apart and it comes with a lifetime warranty. So it is literally the last wallet I will ever [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=700.32s)]
*  need. And I love this. It has RFID blocking technology. So no digital thieves are sneaking [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=705.12s)]
*  off with your info. I never realized how easy it was for thieves to steal your info by you simply [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=711.2s)]
*  being in their presence. Well, Ridge gives you peace of mind in your pocket. There's even a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  Ridge AirTac attachment so you could always know where it is before you start to panic. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  And for a limited time, our listeners get 10% off at Ridge by using code MIDAS at checkout. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=725.28s)]
*  So just head to ridge.com and use code MIDAS, M-E-I-D-A-S and you're all set. After you purchase, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=730.56s)]
*  they'll ask where you heard about them. Please support our show and tell them we sent you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=737.68s)]
*  Now here's the thing with these MAGA Republicans. They always come unprepared. And as I like to say, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, to me, we shouldn't view this in just political terms like Democrat, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=748.16s)]
*  Republican, Independent, whatever. Like we should just want smart people, competence, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=752.8s)]
*  And so when you see, you know, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary yesterday, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=760.16s)]
*  Kristi Noem, and she held this conference and there are some real serious questions that need [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  to be asked about what happened in Texas. In addition to the fact that there were six major [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=770.4s)]
*  vacancies at the National Weather Service, including a key vacancy for the meteorologist [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=777.76s)]
*  coordinator. Local officials say they didn't get the warnings that they needed and they were [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=783.12s)]
*  pointing fingers at the feds and the forecast from the National Weather Service. The National [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=788.8s)]
*  Weather Service, as we did give the warnings, but 72 hours went by from the floods before Kristi [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=792.64s)]
*  Noem actually activated some of the emergency equipment to save people's lives. That's [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=801.04s)]
*  completely unacceptable. And so questions need to be asked. Why'd you do that? Why did it take you [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=808.24s)]
*  72 hours? But instead she wants to attack former president Biden and she somehow accuses him of [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  the fires in Hawaii, which FEMA was there right away. But he, but she goes, she tries to imply [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=820.88s)]
*  that as a result of FEMA, one in six women were basically sexually assaulted in order to get [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=827.6s)]
*  like aid. I think that's what she's saying here. Play this clip. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=837.2s)]
*  And then after the wildfires in Maui, residents voiced concerns that every FEMA employee that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  they spoke with had different answers. None of them had conversations that resulted in getting [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  assistance that was helpful or any clarity in their situations. The situation in Lahaina was [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  so bad that one in six survivors were forced to trade sexual favors, other favors for just basic [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=856.56s)]
*  supplies. And so it's always an attack on focus on what's happening right now in Texas, 120 deaths, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  160 people still missing. Most of the dead children. I understand it's a one and you know, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=871.1199999999999s)]
*  it's an unprecedented event, but you can't keep saying unprecedented, unprecedented, nothing we [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=877.3599999999999s)]
*  could do. Yes, there is things you can do. Stop it. Cut it out. Of course there's things that you [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=882.32s)]
*  can do. And here she is saying, you know what, at the end of the day, we must respect state's rights. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=887.2s)]
*  State's rights matter the most. They should be handling this, not the feds here. Play this clip. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=893.36s)]
*  State and local leaders know that their communities, what they, they know what they need better than [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=898.0s)]
*  the government ever could. They know their exact needs and they know how best to prepare. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=903.36s)]
*  People forget that the states are older than the constitution and that they created the constitution, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=908.56s)]
*  that federalism matters and state's rights need to be respected. We need to focus more on helping, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  not hindering and state and local authorities need to be empowered. We don't take charge of them. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  We give them the opportunity to lead the way. Really? Because y'all federalized the National [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  Guard right away in Los Angeles to attack the citizens of Los Angeles, but you had to wait 72 [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=931.6s)]
*  hours before taking any action when it came to the floods in terms of bringing some of the critical [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=939.0400000000001s)]
*  emergency equipment. What the hell is wrong with these people? And speaking of what the hell is [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=944.0s)]
*  wrong with these people, here's the mayor of Kerrville and here's this guy. He's being asked [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=948.16s)]
*  basic questions and he's like, guess what? I'm not going to answer you. You're going to do it my way [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=954.24s)]
*  or the highway. Okay? Here, play this clip. To use that morning. I'm sorry. I do not know. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=959.76s)]
*  Listen, people are yelling and I didn't really want to. If you offer only three questions, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=966.08s)]
*  then you're going to have to. Guess what? You're in Kerrville and we're going to do it my way. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=970.56s)]
*  I understand that. Morgan Chesky, please. That's how you're answering. I'm the mayor. You're in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=973.84s)]
*  Kerrville. All right. Well, you clearly don't even know how to handle emergency management [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=978.16s)]
*  in your own city. So you probably shouldn't be the mayor of Kerrville. You know, it's all this good [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=983.52s)]
*  old boy, you know, is that would do it. Why would we ever do that? Why is the government? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=988.56s)]
*  These are not competent human beings. Okay. They're not competent human beings. They're just not doing [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=992.8s)]
*  their jobs. And then when something happens, nothing we can do about it. Just got to pray. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=999.1199999999999s)]
*  Just got to pray. Nothing we can do about it. Just, you know, it is what it is. No, that's not true. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1003.68s)]
*  That's not freaking true. Stop gaslighting us with this crap. Here, the Kerrville mayor is asked an [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1008.56s)]
*  important question about flood warnings. Shouldn't you have flood warnings? I don't want to talk [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1014.56s)]
*  about that. Here, play this clip. The concept of flood warnings have been discussed at least two [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1019.8399999999999s)]
*  dozen times by the county. What's the biggest reason that these systems have not gone into place [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1023.92s)]
*  at this point? You know, Morgan, you and I grew up here and I wasn't an officer in those discussions [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1029.2s)]
*  and frankly, I'm more focused on the future than the past, as you know. What I can say [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1038.56s)]
*  is the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the Texas house have all provided us [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1044.32s)]
*  support and they have all said this is a priority for the upcoming special legislative session [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1050.96s)]
*  as mayor of Kerrville. As someone who grew up here, I'm grateful for their support and I look forward [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1058.32s)]
*  to what they propose during the special session. Okay. I'm sorry that inconveniences you to talk [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1065.2s)]
*  about things, but we need a reckoning of what the hell went down and here he goes, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1069.52s)]
*  my wife's a first grade teacher. Stop acting like first graders. Here, play this clip. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1075.2s)]
*  I'm married to a retired first grade teacher [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1079.36s)]
*  and I learned a little bit about classroom management from her. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1085.68s)]
*  If you yell questions at us, we're probably going to pick someone else to answer. Okay. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  So you feel the need to yell your questions. I will feel the need to not answer your question. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1095.52s)]
*  In first grade, they raised their hands. That might be a good start. Yesterday was a disaster [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1103.68s)]
*  and I was embarrassed. Our town was embarrassed. Your viewers were embarrassed [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1111.52s)]
*  and I don't want that to happen again. Stop acting like what are these people talking about? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1119.36s)]
*  Finally, I'll show you this. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin took to the Senate floor and he talked [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1123.52s)]
*  about how the Trump regime is rescinding all of the funding for public TV and he's like, also, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  public TV plays a major role in disaster warning. So can we not cut funding for something that was [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1137.12s)]
*  once always bipartisan? Here, play this clip. This request would cut $1.1 billion from the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1143.76s)]
*  Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Do you listen to public radio, public TV? Are you aware [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1150.08s)]
*  of what it does for your community? This would eliminate any federal assistance for a Corporation [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1157.1999999999998s)]
*  for Public Broadcasting. It includes $700 million that's eliminated to provide critical funding for [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1163.12s)]
*  local public media. This would devastate more than 1,500 public radio and TV stations across this [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  country. Bottom line, do you think we're better off with less information as Americans or more? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1177.6s)]
*  Bottom line, do you want a choice to pick your own source of information? Do you want that choice [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1183.52s)]
*  to include Corporation for Public Broadcasting? The president says no, we're not going to provide [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1188.9599999999998s)]
*  the assistance for that to continue. What it means is for small towns in downstate Illinois, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1195.12s)]
*  all the way up to Chicago, in the classrooms there, public media stations provide essential [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1201.76s)]
*  nonpartisan news coverage, life-saving emergency and weather alerts, an educational program for [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1208.08s)]
*  our kids. I don't know the circumstances in Texas for this terrible flooding, and I don't want to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1214.2399999999998s)]
*  presume anything, but as a general rule, more emergency information available to American [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  families is better than worse. Well, there you have it, folks. Let me know what you think. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1226.8s)]
*  We're going to hold them accountable every step of the way. I'm not afraid to report this stuff. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGChr04bVQ&t=1231.04s)]
