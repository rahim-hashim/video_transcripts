# Trump Admin LETS IT SLIP in DISASTER Conference Call
**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU)
*  Wow, the Trump regime just held a very incriminating video conference call. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=0.0s)]
*  It was led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and it's regarding the catastrophic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=4.9s)]
*  flash floods in Texas. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=10.1s)]
*  Kristi Noem tries to blame, essentially, Texas and says, look, we the Trump regime believe [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=12.24s)]
*  in federalism now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=17.54s)]
*  This is a state's rights issue, and this is what Texas should be dealing with, not the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  feds. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=24.34s)]
*  Kristi Noem then tries to blame former President Biden as well, and says, well, look how Biden [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=25.38s)]
*  handled the situation in Hawaii. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=30.62s)]
*  That was much worse than this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=33.28s)]
*  Seriously, this is what you're doing right now as the death toll from these catastrophic [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  floods in the Kerr County region is now at 120, and there are still around 160 people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=39.08s)]
*  who are missing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=48.06s)]
*  So as you dig deeper, you start to learn that Kristi Noem is hiding some additional facts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=50.22s)]
*  And hat tip to CNN for getting this scoop. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=56.12s)]
*  This was a CNN exclusive from multiple sources. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=59.58s)]
*  Kristi Noem did not authorize FEMA's deployment of urban search and rescue teams until Monday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=63.34s)]
*  That's more than 72 hours after the flooding began. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Several sources told CNN 72 hours passed before the federal government allowed urban [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=77.38s)]
*  search and rescue teams to do their work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that Kristi Noem put as a barrier to the quick and efficient activation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  of urban search and rescue teams is any expense over $100,000 by FEMA had to be personally [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=94.38s)]
*  approved and signed off by her. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=102.86s)]
*  And according to these sources, she did not give the sign off until Monday, 72 hours after [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=105.88s)]
*  the flooding began. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  The way it's supposed to work is those federal resources should be pre-positioned or the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=113.88s)]
*  federal government should federalize the resources and pre-position them before the flood even [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=120.0s)]
*  starts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=125.72s)]
*  You don't wait until Monday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=126.96s)]
*  And by the way, this is in addition to the fact that there were six critical vacancies [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=130.04s)]
*  at the Texas National Weather Service of people who were pushed out by Donald Trump and Doge, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=135.62s)]
*  including the main meteorologist coordinator who would have supervised that Kerr County, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=142.6s)]
*  Kerrville region. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=149.14s)]
*  So what was Kristi Noem? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  We could all, we could put this timeline together. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=153.18s)]
*  What was Kristi Noem doing now? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=155.48s)]
*  Instead of authorizing the urban search and rescue teams on Monday, she was posting on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Instagram photos of herself. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=165.56s)]
*  Kristi Noem asked her followers on Instagram instead of authorizing the urban search and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=168.76s)]
*  rescue teams what her official governor portrait should be. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=174.78s)]
*  While the girls were missing and being killed in these Texas floods, she wanted to know [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  should I go with the official governor portrait number one of me on this horse? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=185.94s)]
*  How about the Miss Blondie photo of myself? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=190.34s)]
*  Or how about I go with Iceman number three? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=194.3s)]
*  You all should vote. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=197.5s)]
*  By the way, what was Donald Trump doing over the weekend? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=198.5s)]
*  What would a normal president do? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=201.9s)]
*  You'd be in a situation room. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=203.74s)]
*  You'd be with all of your top emergency assets. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  You would go to the main FEMA control center. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=208.44s)]
*  You would be there as the quarterback, as the leader, making sure that everything was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=211.44s)]
*  being deployed. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=216.96s)]
*  That's what Biden did. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=218.6s)]
*  That's what Obama did. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=219.88s)]
*  That's what you do when you're in charge. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=221.56s)]
*  What was Donald Trump doing? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=223.32s)]
*  We literally have the video of Donald Trump golfing all weekend, licking this stupid ice [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=224.6s)]
*  cream cone, looking stupid, humiliating our country while Texas, while Kerr County was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=230.32s)]
*  under water. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=237.36s)]
*  I don't want to hear it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=238.36s)]
*  Oh Ben, it's too soon that you could. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=239.36s)]
*  I'm going to criticize. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=241.84s)]
*  I'm going to call it out what it is right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=242.84s)]
*  And I am pissed and I am angry right now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=245.28s)]
*  And this was the conference call that Kristi Noem held moments ago. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=248.24s)]
*  It was a video conference with others at FEMA where she's like, I think we did great. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=252.52s)]
*  I think everything was really good here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=257.36s)]
*  And she goes, people forget that the states are older than the Constitution. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  Federalism means that the states do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=264.16s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=266.88s)]
*  State and local leaders know that their communities, they know what they need better than the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=268.32s)]
*  government ever could. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=273.52s)]
*  They know their exact needs and they know how best to prepare. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=275.06s)]
*  People forget that the states are older than the Constitution and that they created the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=278.8s)]
*  Constitution, that federalism matters and states' rights need to be respected. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  We need to focus more on helping, not hindering, and state and local authorities need to be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  empowered. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't take charge of them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  We give them the opportunity to lead the way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=296.64s)]
*  Well, Governor Newsom's office responded, ah yes, federalism, unless you're California, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  where there isn't states' rights. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=305.0s)]
*  And in California, the Trump regime federalized the National Guard to be used against people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=306.84s)]
*  who live in Los Angeles to literally invade our own cities and our own states. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=313.96s)]
*  But when it comes to Texas, they wouldn't federalize the search and rescue equipment [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=320.88s)]
*  and they weren't authorizing the urban search and rescue teams because federalism, because [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=325.8s)]
*  they said that's a state's right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  How utterly pathetic is this right now? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me just show you right here the CNN scoop and then I want to show you more from that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=336.48s)]
*  conference call. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=340.62s)]
*  FEMA's response to Texas floods slowed by Nome's cost controls. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=341.62s)]
*  As monstrous flood waters surged across central Texas late last week, officials at FEMA leapt [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  into action. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=351.56s)]
*  They prepared to deploy critical search and rescue teams and life-saving resources like [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=353.4s)]
*  they have in countless past disasters. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=357.72s)]
*  But almost instantly, FEMA ran into bureaucratic obstacles, four officials inside the agency [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=360.2s)]
*  told CNN. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=365.82s)]
*  As CNN previously reported, Homeland Security Secretary Cristino, whose department oversees [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=367.12s)]
*  FEMA recently enacted a sweeping rule aimed at cutting spending. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=372.16s)]
*  Every contract and grant, over $100,000, now requires her personal sign-off before any funds can be released. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=377.84s)]
*  For FEMA, where disaster response costs routinely soar into the billions, as agency contracts [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=385.84s)]
*  with on-the-ground crews, officials say the threshold is essentially pennies, requiring [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=391.44s)]
*  sign-offs for relatively small expenditures. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=396.96s)]
*  In essence, they say the order has stripped the agency of much of its autonomy at the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=400.8s)]
*  very moment its help is needed the most. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=406.44s)]
*  We were operating under a clear set of guidance, lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=409.0s)]
*  the state needs and be ready to deliver it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=413.88s)]
*  A longtime FEMA official told CNN, that is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=416.12s)]
*  For example, as central Texas towns were submerged in rising waters, FEMA officials realized [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=422.28s)]
*  they could not pre-position urban search and rescue crews from a network of teams stationed [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=428.28s)]
*  regionally across the country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=435.12s)]
*  Texas did request aerial imagery from FEMA to aid search and rescue operations, a source [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=437.36s)]
*  told CNN, but that was delayed as it awaited Nome's approval for the necessary contract. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  FEMA staff have also been answering phones at a disaster call center, where according [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=449.36s)]
*  to one agency official, callers have faced longer wait times as the agency awaited Nome's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  approval for a contract to bring in additional support staff. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=459.68s)]
*  The chaos has exposed a deeper uncertainty within FEMA about the ability to respond, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=464.8s)]
*  its mission and its authority under the Trump regime, just as hurricane and wildfire season [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=471.12s)]
*  has gotten underway. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=476.88s)]
*  The article goes on to say, for a long time now, FEMA, former FEMA officials, former NOAA [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  officials, everybody, we here at the Midas Touch Network, we've brought in top emergency [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=484.0s)]
*  management specialists, everybody, what have we been saying now for what? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  Six months, FEMA, FEMA, FEMA, FEMA, over and over again, because DOGE is destroying the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency, they're destroying the National Weather Service, and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  separately, they're destroying FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=501.28s)]
*  It goes on to say, by Tuesday night, the federal response finally expanded to 311 staffers, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=506.84s)]
*  the data showed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=512.96s)]
*  Multiple FEMA officials told CNN that they were taken aback by the agency's relatively [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=514.04s)]

*  The tragedy in Texas has made one thing clear, the buck now stops with Nome. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=524.12s)]
*  And then the response by the Trump regime is, DHS is rooting out waste fraud abuse and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  is reprioritizing appropriated dollars. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Nome is delivering accountability to the U.S. taxpayer, which Washington bureaucrats [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=538.64s)]
*  have ignored for decades at the expense of the American citizens. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=544.4s)]
*  Ah, that's what that is. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=548.48s)]
*  This is what accountability looks like, everybody. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  It's the opposite of accountability. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=552.92s)]
*  As she's posting Instagram photos and polls of which photo she should use for her official [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=555.08s)]
*  portrait, should I be Miss Blondie? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=561.88s)]
*  Miss Blondie, people were dying. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what was happening. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=566.36s)]
*  So while we're talking about all this, I want to make sure we keep talking about the climate [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=567.44s)]
*  as well. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  Just because the Republicans passed their big disastrous budget bill doesn't mean we [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=571.6s)]
*  stop talking about it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=575.2s)]
*  If anything, we need to be talking about it even more. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about what this Republican budget bill means for the climate and, by the way, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=580.12s)]
*  your wallet too. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=584.16s)]
*  While wildfires rage, heat domes expand, and floods destroy lives from Texas to Vermont, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  Republicans just passed a bill that guts funding for clean energy, hikes energy costs on working [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=590.48s)]
*  families, and showers billionaire donors with tax breaks. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  Instead of investing in affordable solar, wind, and grid modernization, this bill doubles [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=598.4799999999999s)]
*  down on fossil fuel subsidies and gives subsidies to coal. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  It slashes programs that help low-income families weatherize their homes and pay utility bills, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=606.8s)]
*  just as extreme heat is driving record demand for electricity. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  So who benefits? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  Big oil, wealthy donors. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Who pays? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=619.16s)]
*  You. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=620.16s)]
*  Me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=621.16s)]
*  This bill cuts budget bills, higher gas prices, higher costs to breathe clean air and drink [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=622.16s)]
*  safe water. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=626.16s)]
*  This bill also cuts Medicaid and food assistance, forcing families to choose between medical [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=627.68s)]
*  care, groceries, or keeping the AC on in a heat wave, all to fund luxury tax cuts for [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=632.36s)]
*  the richest people in America. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=638.0s)]
*  This is a time where we need to be clear. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=640.18s)]
*  This is not just bad policy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=642.92s)]
*  It is climate denial dressed up as a budget. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=644.78s)]
*  Americans are raising costs on working Americans at the worst possible time, and the American [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=648.28s)]
*  people know it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  So we have to stay united and we have to stay loud. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=653.9s)]
*  So I want to encourage you all to leave your comments about this on this video and make [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=657.12s)]
*  your voices heard. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=660.92s)]
*  We're going to stay laser focused on these climate issues, and I want to thank you for [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=662.56s)]
*  joining us because if we don't stop them, we are not just losing money, we are losing [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  our future. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=670.64s)]
*  Okay, back to you, Ben. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=671.64s)]
*  Here Kristi Noem then goes and says just some heinous things about Biden's response. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=673.64s)]
*  She's like, look, it's good. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=678.64s)]
*  She goes, if you look at Biden's response in Hawaii, she goes, one in six women were [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=679.64s)]
*  forced to trade sexual favors for basic supplies, and she tries to blame that on Biden. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=684.72s)]
*  What the hell did she just do? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=690.36s)]
*  What the hell is this right here? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=692.24s)]
*  This is what you mean by accountability? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=693.84s)]
*  F that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=695.72s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=696.72s)]
*  And then after the wildfires in Maui, residents voiced concerns that every FEMA employee that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=697.72s)]
*  they spoke with had different answers. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=703.0999999999999s)]
*  None of them had conversations that resulted in getting assistance that was helpful or [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=705.5s)]
*  any clarity in their situations. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=709.76s)]
*  The situation in Lahaina was so bad that one in six survivors were forced to trade sexual [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=712.18s)]
*  favors, other favors for just basic supplies. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=718.18s)]
*  Okay, so you want to transfer this to the states and the locals? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=720.9799999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about the mayor of Kerrville. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=724.26s)]
*  Here's what he said this morning. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=726.9799999999999s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=728.26s)]
*  I'm a retired first grade teacher. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=729.26s)]
*  And I learned a little bit about classroom management from her. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=735.26s)]
*  If you yell questions at us, we're probably going to pick someone else to answer. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=740.42s)]
*  Okay? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=745.26s)]
*  So you feel the need to yell your questions. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=746.26s)]
*  I will feel the need to not answer your question. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=749.54s)]
*  In first grade, they raise their hands. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=753.3s)]
*  That might be a good start. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=756.58s)]
*  Today was a disaster. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=758.82s)]
*  And I was embarrassed. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  Our town was embarrassed. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=762.7s)]
*  Your viewers were embarrassed. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=764.26s)]
*  And I don't want that to happen again. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=768.94s)]
*  Okay, you want to see what the Kerr County Sheriff had to say? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=770.22s)]
*  Let's see, Kristi Noem, what the Kerr County Sheriff had to say. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=774.22s)]
*  Let's see his response. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=777.22s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=778.34s)]
*  Question for the sheriff. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=779.34s)]
*  The code red alert system has come under a lot of scrutiny in recent days. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=780.34s)]
*  And now there's reports of a timeline on Friday morning where an Ingram volunteer fired a [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=785.74s)]
*  pregnant commander, asked a Kerr County Sheriff dispatcher for the code red to be issued. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=790.9000000000001s)]
*  The dispatcher says, I can't, I have to get a supervisor's approval for that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=799.82s)]
*  Almost six hours passes until 10 o'clock, when 1004, when the code red is issued. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=804.86s)]
*  How do you account for that lapse of time? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=811.5400000000001s)]
*  What happened and what could have happened in that time? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=813.78s)]
*  As I said earlier, with every significant event, you know, we're going with every emergency, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=816.26s)]
*  you know what? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=822.62s)]
*  We're going to have to, there's going to be an after action. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=823.62s)]
*  Please, y'all, listen to those words, after action. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=826.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=829.14s)]
*  Oh, and what are the MAGA Republican Congress members like Roger Williams saying? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=830.14s)]
*  You shouldn't criticize this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=835.42s)]
*  Just write nice letters to us and pray. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=837.26s)]
*  Give us prayer. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=839.74s)]
*  Send us nice letters. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=840.74s)]
*  You should not be saying negative things about the response here. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=841.9399999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=844.86s)]
*  This guy's a nut, okay? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=845.86s)]
*  And let me tell you, these left-wing liberals that want to make this political and blame [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=846.86s)]
*  this storm on Donald Trump for crying out loud. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=851.18s)]
*  This was an act of God, likely never seen before. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=853.66s)]
*  I would say to these people, where's your heart? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=857.4599999999999s)]
*  Where's your soul when it comes to thinking not one time did Donald even mention victims [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=859.34s)]
*  or the families or whatever. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=863.74s)]
*  It's all about Donald Trump and Donald Trump's doing a great job. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=865.74s)]
*  So I'm tired of hearing from these people. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=868.82s)]
*  Like I said, where's your heart? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=870.5400000000001s)]
*  Where's your soul? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=873.0600000000001s)]
*  Why don't they write a nice letter to somebody? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=874.0600000000001s)]
*  Why don't they get on there and say, we're going to pray for these people. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=875.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's hold hands and do that. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=878.1s)]
*  We don't see that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=879.7s)]
*  And that's where they are. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=880.7s)]
*  That's a good example of where the left is today. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=881.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's really all you can do. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=883.82s)]
*  Again, just pray for these people. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=885.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, praising FEMA, it's one thing to criticize the president. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=887.4200000000001s)]
*  Praising FEMA, he must forget about 20 years ago and Hurricane Katrina and the failed response [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=891.38s)]
*  from FEMA on that level. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=897.78s)]
*  And again, not necessarily getting rid of it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=898.98s)]
*  But if you just listen to what the president said, they're passing the money to the states [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=901.34s)]
*  because the states and local municipalities know how to spend that money, know how, know [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=904.46s)]
*  their resources, know the lay of the land, especially Hill Country better than someone [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=908.82s)]
*  with a federal response that doesn't even live in that area. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=914.42s)]
*  What's Donald Trump saying? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying, congratulations, we did an amazing job. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=918.5s)]
*  A plus. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=922.42s)]
*  This is how responses are supposed to be done. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=923.42s)]
*  What? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=926.98s)]
*  Your play this clip. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=927.98s)]
*  The response has been incredible. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=928.98s)]
*  And the fact that we got along so well, I don't know. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=929.98s)]

*  But we got along so well and it was so unified. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=936.5799999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of lives have been saying that could have been as bad as it was. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=940.02s)]
*  And you could have lost double or triple. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=944.5s)]

*  And that is Texas, every square inch of our state [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=992.4200000000001s)]

*  The championship teams are the ones that say, don't worry about it, man. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1017.94s)]
*  We got this. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1021.46s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we go score again that we're going to win this game. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1022.5s)]
*  The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1026.46s)]
*  They talk about solutions. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1029.78s)]

*  over the weekend, right? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1036.46s)]

*  When Donald Trump was asked, do you think the federal government needs [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1048.3s)]
*  to hire back any meteorologists who were fired? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1051.5s)]

*  You play this clip. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1059.9399999999998s)]

*  any of the meteorologists who were fired in the last few months? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1064.4199999999998s)]
*  I would know that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1068.6999999999998s)]
*  I really wouldn't. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1069.9799999999998s)]
*  I would think not. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1070.78s)]
*  This was the thing that happened in seconds. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1072.22s)]
*  Nobody expected it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1074.34s)]
*  Nobody saw it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1075.42s)]
*  Very talented people are there and they didn't see it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1077.26s)]
*  It's I guess they said once in a hundred years, they've never seen anything like this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1080.5s)]
*  So I wouldn't. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1084.34s)]
*  I mean, people are trying to blame the school. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1086.18s)]
*  They're trying to blame the camp. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1088.1399999999999s)]

*  But no, I wouldn't say that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1092.78s)]
*  OK. And now what is the judge saying? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1094.3799999999999s)]
*  The judge in Kerr County is like the mayor. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1097.94s)]
*  So Kerrville is a city. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1101.18s)]
*  They have a mayor. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1102.7s)]
*  Kerr County is a county. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1103.78s)]
*  And sometimes you would have like a board of supervisors for a county in Kerr County [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1106.22s)]
*  that their judge is the top county official. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1110.18s)]

*  Judge, why weren't these camps evacuated yesterday? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1114.6200000000001s)]

*  We have floods all the time. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1146.98s)]
*  This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1148.18s)]

*  When it rains, we get water. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1154.38s)]
*  We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what's happened here. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1156.46s)]
*  OK. And what are some other local officials saying? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1159.9s)]
*  The local officials blame inaccurate forecasts from the National Weather Service. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1162.46s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1166.94s)]
*  Forecast that we received on Wednesday from the National Weather Service [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1167.5800000000002s)]
*  predicted three to six inches of rain in the Concho Valley [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  and four to eight inches of rain in the Hill Country. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1175.74s)]
*  We worked with our own meteorologist to fine tune that weather statement. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1179.42s)]
*  And as many of you know, and many of you in broadcast journalism [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1182.74s)]
*  meteorology, you can go back and look at your own forecast. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1185.3s)]
*  And the amount of rain that fell in this specific location [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1188.34s)]
*  was never in any of those forecasts. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1190.9s)]
*  This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1192.94s)]
*  forecasted on both of those forks. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1196.54s)]
*  When we got the report, it was about seven feet or so on the South Fork. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1199.14s)]
*  And within a matter of minutes, it was up to 29 feet. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1203.66s)]
*  And all of that converged at the Guadalupe. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1206.5s)]
*  And that's where we saw those very quick rise in flood. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1209.66s)]
*  But listen, everybody got the forecast from the National Weather Service, right? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1212.98s)]
*  You all got it. You're all in media. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1216.94s)]
*  You got that forecast. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1218.3s)]
*  It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1219.62s)]
*  Well, I'm going to keep calling this out here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1222.02s)]
*  I don't care if we're taking criticism. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1224.78s)]

*  No, I could I could do two things at the same time. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1228.94s)]
*  Absolutely. My thoughts, my prayers, my heart. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1232.02s)]
*  I mourn for the loss of life in Texas [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1235.7s)]
*  and for all of these natural disasters that have taken [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1240.18s)]
*  hundreds of lives of Americans that Donald Trump hasn't even addressed any of them. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1243.3s)]
*  But I think the best way, in addition to mourning for people, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1247.94s)]
*  in addition to sending prayers, in addition to showing [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1251.6599999999999s)]
*  that this is a heartbreaking thing for you, is actually to do action. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1255.6599999999999s)]
*  And yes, that means to hold people accountable. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1260.58s)]
*  Yes, that means to try to figure out what happened [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1263.2199999999998s)]
*  and then to also bring to justice people who were wrong in this situation, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1266.5s)]
*  people who are now covering it up in this situation. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnpi5EH4XPU&t=1271.8999999999999s)]
