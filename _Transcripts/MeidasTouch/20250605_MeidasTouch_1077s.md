# MAGA Mike has WORST DAY OF HIS LIFE after TERRIBLE NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw)
*  And you Brutus, you have MAGA Mike Johnson, you just got stabbed in the back by Elon Musk, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  who you thought was your friend, my friend Elon Musk. We partied together at the UFC fights. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=7.44s)]
*  Uh-uh, Elon Musk doesn't like you. Elon Musk isn't returning your phone calls anymore. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=13.6s)]
*  Elon Musk says that he's going to run primary challenges against any MAGA Republican Congress [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=20.0s)]
*  member who votes for the disastrous budget bill. Elon Musk says that the budget bill MAGA Mike [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=26.8s)]
*  is a total abomination and that it needs to be killed immediately. Elon Musk keeps posting, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=32.96s)]
*  kill the bill. But I thought MAGA Mike Johnson, you said that Elon Musk had the genius algorithms [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=39.52s)]
*  and the AI and it figured out ways to make this bill so big and beautiful. What happened? He hates [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  the bill MAGA Mike Johnson. Yep. So MAGA Mike Johnson, the speaker of the house, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=53.76s)]
*  he thought he was close to the end zone. He thought he was going to deliver the touchdown [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=58.8s)]
*  for Donald Trump, a disastrous budget bill, which I refer to as the murder bill, which would literally [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=63.44s)]
*  kill tens of millions of Americans, take 11 million Americans or so off of healthcare, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=70.64s)]
*  give the billionaires trillions of dollars in tax cuts, steal food from the mouths of low income [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=77.36s)]
*  people, get rid of supplemental nutrition assistance programs, buy-buy food stamps, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=84.16s)]
*  make more people unhoused by removing rental assistance in section eight housing, taking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=89.92s)]
*  away women's reproductive rights, you know, all the things that the MAGA Republicans love in their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=95.84s)]
*  death cult and all of the suffering. But you see for Elon Musk, the problem is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=101.28s)]
*  because of the increase in the deficit, Elon Musk, I think actually wants more cruelty [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=106.72s)]
*  in this budget bill and you ain't given it to Elon Musk MAGA Mike Johnson. So Elon Musk came out [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=114.16s)]
*  strong against the budget bill. He's saying kill the bill. Elon Musk has been posting all of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=120.88s)]
*  comment sections from Fox with people saying that they feel betrayed by MAGA Mike Johnson [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=126.96s)]
*  and Donald Trump about how abysmal this budget bill is. And Mike Johnson says that Elon Musk is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=133.12s)]
*  ghosting him. Elon Musk won't return his call. Watch MAGA Mike Johnson's disastrous press [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  conference. Let's play this clip. You talked to Elon on Monday, he made this 180. What do you think [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=145.44s)]
*  change? Why do you think he's coming out against this now? And have you spoken to the president [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=151.28s)]
*  and Elon since the infamous tweet? Well, I'll tell you, I called Elon last night and he didn't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  answer, but I hope to talk to him today. I mean, it's not, you know, it's very friendly and we can [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=161.04s)]
*  and we've laughed about our differences on policy before. I'm not upset about this and I just, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=166.72s)]
*  I think he understands and he's acknowledged to me before that this is so serious that we can't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  fool around with it. I mean, the debt cliff is approaching very quickly, right? All the things [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=178.8s)]
*  that are in this bill are so important for the U.S. economy. It's going to be jet fuel for the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  U.S. economy. All boats are going to rise and the sooner we do that, the better. And the risk of not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  getting it done is enormous, not just for the Republican Party, but for the country. We got to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  do this. We're going to have the largest tax increase in U.S. history at the end of the year [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=196.08s)]
*  if we fail and all the other calamities that we've talked about. So we've got to get it done. And I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  think Elon understands the weight of that and I hope he comes around. I'd love to talk to him this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=203.52s)]
*  week and hope he calls him back today. And then Maga Mike Johnson says that he thinks that Elon [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=206.32s)]
*  Musk is just flat wrong. Here, play this clip. And then yesterday, you know, 24 hours later, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=211.2s)]
*  he does a 180 and he comes out and opposed the bill. And it surprised me, frankly, and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=217.28s)]
*  I don't take it personal. We don't take it personal. You know, he's, policy differences are not [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  personal. I think he's flat wrong. I think he's way off on this and I've told him as much and I've [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=227.44s)]
*  said it publicly and privately. I'm very consistent in that. But am I concerned about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=234.4s)]
*  the effect of this on the midterms? I'm not. Let me tell you why. Because when the big beautiful [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=238.56s)]
*  bill is done and signed into law, every single American is going to do better. This bill is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  geared for middle and working class Americans and they are going to feel the effects of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=246.8s)]
*  And they're going to feel it before the midterm election. So I have no concern whatsoever. I'm [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  absolutely convinced that we're going to win the midterms and grow the House majority because we're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=255.36s)]
*  delivering for the American people and fulfilling our campaign promises. And we'll see how that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=259.12s)]
*  happens. Magan Mike Johnson also says that he speaks to Donald Trump multiple times a day. He [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=262.16s)]
*  used to speak to Elon Musk multiple times a day and he goes, Donald Trump is not delighted. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=268.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's been like hiding since last Friday where he went to the U.S. Steel Factory in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=276.16s)]
*  Pittsburgh and lied to the steel workers that Nippon Steel was not acquiring them when they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  clearly were. But here's the Magan Mike Johnson thing. I talk to Donald Trump multiple times a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=287.84s)]
*  day here play this clip. I've talked to President Trump all the time, multiple times a day. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=292.64s)]
*  Obviously, we've talked about this. As you know, he's not delighted that Elon did a 180 on that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=299.52s)]
*  Look, I don't know what happened in 24 hours. Everybody can draw their own conclusions about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=308.4s)]
*  that. But I look forward to talking to my friend about it again. And I'm not upset about it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=311.76s)]
*  Olivia. And you Brutus and you Brutus too. Even Steve Bannon has come out against this budget bill [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=318.08s)]
*  and Steve Bannon says, look, if you want to reduce the debt significantly, you got to tax the rich. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  You got to tax the wealthy. And I can't believe, am I really saying this, that I agree with Steve [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=330.88s)]
*  Bannon here that you do need to tax the rich. Even a broken clock is right twice. Here, play this clip. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=336.4s)]
*  Stop the dead bomb. Elon and the guys on Capitol Hill, you're going to have to raise taxes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=342.8s)]
*  The wealthy can't get an extension of the tax cut. That's got to go to the middle class and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=351.44s)]
*  the working class. That has to be extended and has to be made permanent. At 40% of the top bracket [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=355.6s)]
*  or 40%, you pick them. That's got to go to 39, go back to 30, snap back to 39 and a half percent [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  to go to 40%. The math simply doesn't work. Here's Magga Republican Senator Rand Paul. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=369.12s)]
*  Here's what he's got to say. Play this clip. President Trump chided Kentucky Republican Rand [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=374.24s)]
*  Paul today for opposing the bill. Senator, he says that you don't understand the bill and that you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=379.04s)]
*  love to vote no. Well, I would say that's not actually true. I would say that I've been pretty [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=386.72s)]
*  consistent in my time in the Senate at being opposed to deficit spending. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's what Magga Republican Congress member Ralph Norman has to say. Play this clip. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=399.76s)]
*  Putting GOP supporters on the defensive. He says you're basically saddling this country with [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  unsustainable debt. Well, he's right. The debt is unsustainable. After the house. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=411.76s)]
*  Summer is here and so are the mosquitoes. I don't know about you, but there's nothing worse than [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=416.48s)]
*  finally lying down for the night. We'll need to hear that high-pitched buzz near your ear [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=420.8s)]
*  or waking up with bites and no clue where the little culprit went. And if you've got kids or [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=425.28s)]
*  pets, forget about it. You're on constant mosquito patrol. In a world where AI drives cars and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  automates homes, we still struggle to track down a single mosquito. That changes right now with [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  Bzigo Iris, the first AI-powered mosquito detector revolutionizing pest control. Bzigo Iris is a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  cutting edge device that uses computer vision and AI to detect, track, and pinpoint mosquitoes [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=450.08s)]
*  in real time. No more swatting at thin air, just precision targeting. It scans 24-7, works in total [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=456.15999999999997s)]

*  for travel too. Pair it with the Bzigo Swatter and you're covered day or night. Stop losing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=469.36s)]
*  sleep over mosquitoes. Take back your nights with Bzigo. Go to bzigo.com slash discount slash [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=475.2s)]

*  that he does. He's like, well, that medallia, and it's not actually, if you go back and watch this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  guy speak before he's like made up a fake voice, it's so weird. Here, play this clip. He's frustrated. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=518.48s)]
*  I think he believes in my judgment correctly that we're quickly becoming debt slaves, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  that Congress needs to to rearm the magical healing power of no. And I agree with him. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=531.76s)]
*  Having said that, I'm not ready to throw in the towel on this bill. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=540.88s)]
*  And guess what, everybody? Maggert Republican James Comer. I'm James Comer. James Comer's very [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=546.0s)]
*  upset about this. It wasn't helpful. What Elon Musk did. I'm James Comer. Here, play this clip. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=552.32s)]
*  I want to support President Trump and his agenda. The big, beautiful bill is that. So it's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  disappointing that Elon Musk said what he said. It wasn't helpful, but at the end of the day, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's going to sway very much influence. We're focused on pricing President [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump's agenda. And I'm confident there are enough senators that will pass that bill out of the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  Senate. And hopefully we can agree to the changes that they make in the Senate and get President [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=576.48s)]
*  Trump his first major legislative victory of his second term. All right, Mr. Trump. Take a look at [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=581.12s)]
*  this great line of questioning by Democratic Congress member Garcia, a Maggert Republican [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=586.4s)]
*  Congress member Turner. Play this clip. Mr. Turner, you're one of our witnesses today, an expert on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=591.68s)]
*  economics and a bunch of other things. Mr. Turner, you were about to testify as an expert on [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=597.04s)]
*  government spending. This is your post. Is this correct? Did you post this, sir? Yes, sir. OK, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=601.76s)]
*  you called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. 100%. Which we know Elon Musk has also done. I'm glad [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=606.72s)]
*  you admitted it. Social Security is a government sponsored Ponzi scheme, as you said. Now, I. What [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  about the second part, though, sir? I should be able to keep 100% of my money and not watch [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=619.76s)]
*  government waste it, giving $9 billion. Thank you, sir. Giving $9 billion to climate groups. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  Sir, I'm reclining my time, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you, sir. A Ponzi scheme. And so I think [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=630.4s)]
*  it's interesting, of course, as one of our Republican witnesses is calling Social Security [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=634.4s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme, and that's the person that we should be taking advice from here today. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=638.88s)]
*  Without Social Security, 22 million people would be pushed into poverty. That includes over 16 million [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=643.36s)]
*  seniors and nearly one million children. And in fact, Elon Musk has also said and agreed with you, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  sir, that this is a Ponzi scheme. I think it's ironic that you are one of our witnesses talking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=654.88s)]
*  about efficiency when you want to attack the single best program that we have to support people, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=659.6s)]
*  not just out of poverty, but across this country to uplift them to ensure they can afford a decent [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  life. We on this committee need to work every single day, not just to protect Social Security, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=670.16s)]
*  but to hold Republicans accountable for attacking Medicare, Medicaid, for attacking Social Security [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=674.88s)]
*  and the programs that we all depend on. With that, I yield back. Thank you. And just the guitar [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  lobs getting in on the action. He says she goes pro-democracy hero over at Fox. She goes, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=685.36s)]
*  Steve Bannon, a huge supporter of Donald Trump, feels the same way as Musk. Play this clip. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=690.48s)]
*  That's what matters. And Steve Bannon, a huge supporter of President Trump, feels the same as [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk does about it. He says you're going to have to raise taxes. And the Republicans have a [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=698.72s)]
*  new talking point. Mike Johnson was doing this on the Sunday shows. Lutnick's tried it. Besson's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  tried it. Where they say, oh, the CBO, it's a Democratic organization. It's run by a Bush appointee [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=706.96s)]
*  who's only ever donated once to a candidate and it was a Republican in 2014. But the CBO was fine [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=711.6s)]
*  in 2018 and 2019 when their projections were 99.9, 99.5% accurate grading Trump's bill. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=717.84s)]
*  But because it's- But Jessica, let's just be honest. I've worked on Capitol Hill starting in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  1996. You can do the math. Okay. Ever since then, anybody who is president and has done have a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=730.48s)]
*  con- They hate the CBO. And Biden, they hated the CBO then. But the point is that it's accurate. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=736.4s)]
*  And they're saying that it's a lie. I actually don't think that it's correct to say that it's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=743.28s)]
*  accurate. I think that it is complicated and complex and difficult and you can argue it in [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=747.28s)]
*  all these different ways and you can get different people to use different numbers. But the Biden [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=751.68s)]
*  people hated CBO and now the Trump people hates you. It's like it always- So now with [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  Magomaique Johnson and Donald Trump's feelings all hurt. You know, they got to come up with their [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=761.36s)]
*  distraction, right? They got to come up with their distraction. So here you have Dan Bongino going [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=766.8s)]
*  on Fox and rather than them devoting the time to talking about Elon Musk trying to tank this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=772.4s)]
*  disastrous budget bill, what do they spend their time on? Dan Bongino says, damn right, we're [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=778.64s)]
*  focusing on the COVID origins. Damn right. That's what we're focused on here. Play this clip. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=784.48s)]
*  Let me ask you about, and again, a lightning round. Let's go quickly. COVID origins. Are we [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=789.36s)]
*  going to find out information that the government lied to us? Damn right you are. We're all over [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  that. The minute I got in there in that job, I said, hey, get everybody- They purposely lied [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=799.52s)]
*  to the American people. They purposely lied to us. Oh, you're going to find out. Yeah, listen, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=803.76s)]
*  that's the one I'm the most optimistic about. I was pretty clear on my social media account [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=808.24s)]
*  that I ordered that case immediately to be looked into again. We have a great investigator on it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=812.64s)]
*  and I think we should see action on that one shortly. Then you had MAGA Republican Congress [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=820.48s)]
*  member Crane and he was all upset. He's like, why didn't Elon Musk come out earlier? We would [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  have wished that he would have told us he didn't like this bill any earlier. Here, play this clip. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  Why wasn't he talking about this before the bill, right? And that's what frustrates me. Hey, if [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=836.96s)]
*  you're going to be in this fight, be in this fight when we need you because we needed him. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=841.28s)]
*  Musk waited- And finally here we have Jessica Tarlov saying, we've got the congressional budget [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=845.6s)]
*  office scoring. It came out. We know it's going to be added to the deficit here. We're talking [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=851.68s)]
*  about at least 2.4 trillion added to the deficit. We're talking about 16 million Medicaid cuts. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  We're talking about Obamacare credit tax cuts. We're talking about Medicare on the chopping [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=863.36s)]
*  blocks, Medicaid and Medicare. Watch this clip. Not a ton, but I know that I have to to some [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=868.48s)]
*  degree. I mean, I'm a pretty happy Democrat. You are, but that's because you're around us. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=875.36s)]
*  Oh, it's my conservative lift that I get every day. Yes, it is. We keep you real. We keep you [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=880.88s)]
*  real. You don't drift off into some far left loony bin. I mean, sometimes, but no one is in love with [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=887.04s)]
*  Elon Musk. Like politics is a game and JD Vance didn't like Donald Trump a whole lot, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=895.5200000000001s)]
*  He said America's Hitler. Now he's the vice president. Marco Rubio has all the other jobs [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  in the government and he hated Donald Trump. Ted Cruz has forgiven him for saying that his wife is [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=907.12s)]
*  super ugly and saying that his dad was a murderer. Right. Yeah. And he said that about Chris. Anyway, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=912.6400000000001s)]
*  it was only half right. So for this particular, in this particular moment, we have something [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=917.84s)]
*  in common with Elon Musk. You should definitely leverage it. That's what's important. But I do [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=925.76s)]
*  think that Republicans, including my dear colleagues here at the table, would prefer that we were [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=929.44s)]
*  talking about Elon Musk versus the brass tacks of the bill itself. So the final CDO scoring came out [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=934.08s)]
*  today. Oh boy. Yeah. Oh boy. Two point four trillion to the deficit, three point seven trillion in tax [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=941.36s)]
*  cuts, 16 million all in total between Medicaid cuts and Obamacare credit tax cuts going off their [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  health insurance. That's what matters. And Steve- So, uh-oh, Maga Mike Johnson. I'm sorry, Maga Mike. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=954.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, Maga Mike. But what a disastrous bill this is, in all honesty, right? This bill is, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=960.96s)]
*  actually is an abomination. Not for the reasons that Elon Musk doesn't like it. Although I think [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=966.64s)]
*  that we should rein in the deficit. But to me, it's easy. You know how you rein in the deficit? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=972.4799999999999s)]
*  You tax the billionaires more. You do. First off, they should be paying, at the very least, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=976.88s)]
*  the same percentage of their income as everybody else. They shouldn't be paying less. But I think [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=984.0s)]
*  they should be taxed at a higher rate. I think after X hundreds of millions, after X millions [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=989.8399999999999s)]
*  of dollars, then hundreds of millions of dollars, then billions of dollars. Yeah, I think you get [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=995.6s)]
*  taxed more. I think you get- Look, Ro Khanna, Democratic Congress member from Silicon Valley, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1000.08s)]
*  he represents Silicon Valley. Way more billionaires in his district than everywhere. He says, tax the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  rich. Tax my constituents more. They won't feel it. Tax them more. And if they are feeling, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1011.84s)]
*  if they do feel it, if they're too greedy, whatever, then go to another country. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1017.44s)]
*  You want to live in the United States. You get all of these incredible benefits. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1021.36s)]
*  And you think you want tax cuts so you can buy five extra private jets instead of one extra private [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1025.04s)]
*  jets? Nah, F that. Tax the rich. Give people free healthcare. Give people free education. That's a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1031.84s)]
*  right, in my view. Healthcare, education, treat people with dignity and equality. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1038.8s)]
*  People shouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck. It's ridiculous. People should have affordable [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1045.52s)]
*  housing. That's what we should be focused on. Not disastrous budget bills that rip apart [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1050.88s)]
*  government services and take money and take lunch out of the mouths of children. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXFDpFp1Aw&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
