# Trump has DISASTER MORNING with AWFUL Message
**MeidasTouch:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4)
*  So, Donald Trump marked Memorial Day with a bitter, grievance-filled screed, attacking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=0.0s)]
*  judges, immigrants, and his political rivals. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Not once did he even mention the men and women who gave their lives in service for our country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  He says, Happy Memorial Day! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Happy Memorial Day is his message. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=18.78s)]
*  He then goes on to say, Happy Memorial Day to all, including the scum that spent the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=21.52s)]
*  last four years trying to destroy our country through warped, radical left minds who allowed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=28.02s)]
*  21 million people to illegally enter our country, many of them being criminals and mentally [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  insane through an open border that only an incompetent president would have proven through [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=41.18s)]
*  judges who are on a mission to keep murderers, drug dealers, rapists, gang members, and released [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=45.88s)]
*  prisoners from all over the world in our country so they can rob, murder, and rape again, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=52.06s)]
*  all protected by these USA-hating judges who suffer from an ideology that is sick and very [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=57.34s)]
*  dangerous for our country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  Hopefully the United States Supreme Court and other good and compassionate judges throughout [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=65.5s)]
*  the land will save us from the decisions of the monsters who want our country to go to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=69.9s)]
*  hell but fear not. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=75.42s)]
*  We have made great progress over the last four months and America will soon be safe [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=77.14s)]
*  and great again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=82.7s)]
*  Happy Memorial Day and God bless America. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=84.28s)]
*  How utterly vile, pathetic trash is that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=87.14s)]
*  But what else would you expect from Donald Trump who is a sexual abuser? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=90.58s)]
*  He's been found liable for sexual abuse from a felon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=95.62s)]
*  Donald Trump is someone who should be in prison right now for the rest of his life. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=99.06s)]
*  So yes, the felon, the sexual abuser, the con artist, the fraud, the criminal is behaving [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=104.08s)]
*  as such. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=111.06s)]
*  And when he describes right there in this message the monsters who want the country [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=112.1s)]
*  to go to hell, it's always projection from Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  He is talking about himself. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=120.66s)]
*  As retired Circuit Court Judge Ludwig wrote, the Memorial Day message from the President [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  of the United States of America in memory of those who have given their lives defending [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=128.9s)]
*  America and the Constitution and the freedoms that we Americans enjoy on this Memorial Day [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=133.94s)]
*  2025. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  Judge Ludwig, of course, was one of the most conservative judges, federal judges that there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  were. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  And he's reflecting on just how utterly pathetic the Republican Party and Donald Trump has [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  become. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=156.06s)]
*  As our friend Aaron Partis from the Midas Touch Network writes, if Joe Biden posted [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=157.18s)]
*  this Memorial Day message, the mainstream media and Republicans would say he's completely [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=162.86s)]
*  unfit to serve, with many calling for the invocation of the 25th Amendment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=168.56s)]
*  Because it's Trump, everyone remains silent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=174.24s)]
*  We don't remain silent on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=177.86s)]
*  That's why you all need to subscribe to this YouTube channel right here, right now, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=180.68s)]
*  and go to MidasPlus.com. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=185.24s)]
*  We are bigger than the corporate news right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=187.22s)]
*  Get far more views than them, and we speak the truth when we call Donald Trump a vile [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=190.08s)]
*  piece of trash who deserves zero respect, when we call him a felon and a sexual abuser, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  when we call him the biggest stain in the history of the United States, and on this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  Memorial Day, he shows not only that he is unfit, but he is anti-everything our country [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  stands for, that pathetic piece of trash. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=213.33999999999997s)]
*  Sarah Longwell says the following, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=216.11999999999998s)]
*  This is normal and not 25th Amendment behavior. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=225.64s)]
*  People who treat this as acceptable are the insane ones. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=229.2s)]
*  Let me be clear, managers at Wendy's or McDonald's or fast food restaurants or anywhere in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=232.76s)]
*  small businesses across the United States of America are actually competent and qualified [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  people who have jobs with distinction and actually carry themselves appropriately. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=244.0s)]
*  Donald Trump couldn't get a job anywhere with his behavior. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=249.92s)]
*  He was born with a golden spoon in his mouth, and he took that spoon, sharpened it into [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=253.76s)]
*  a knife, and started stabbing people in the neck and enjoying watching people suffer his [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=258.38s)]
*  entire life while he bankrupted things and took glee in it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=264.0s)]
*  That is who that pathetic loser is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=268.46s)]
*  And the rest of the world sees what a pathetic loser he is. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=270.84s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to do 50% tariffs against Europe. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=273.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to do 50% tariffs against Europe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=276.48s)]
*  I'm extending the deadline. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to do tariffs against you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to do tariffs against you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=281.88s)]
*  Oh, Putin, I'm going to sanction you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=283.76s)]
*  I guess I'm not going to sanction you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=285.96s)]
*  What's going on, Putin? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=287.84s)]
*  You're being mean, Putin. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=288.84s)]
*  So utterly ridiculous. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=290.48s)]
*  Let me show you how a president is supposed to behave. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=292.24s)]
*  Here's what former President Barack Obama posted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=295.6s)]
*  On Memorial Day we remember the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform and their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=298.92s)]
*  families have made to preserve our freedom. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=304.74s)]
*  May we always strive to honor the strength and resolve they've shown our country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=307.78s)]
*  Former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote the following. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=313.88s)]
*  On Memorial Day we honor the brave service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=316.78s)]
*  on behalf of our nation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=321.46s)]
*  We owe these heroes and their loved ones everything and we will always remember what they have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=323.78s)]
*  done to protect our freedom. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=328.94s)]
*  But Donald Trump was not done with that post. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  He continued to make post after post after post, not even acknowledging the very purpose [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=334.1s)]
*  of Memorial Day to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifices for our country in the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  military. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  Instead, he's attacking Harvard University. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=345.82000000000005s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump is posting this morning. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=349.1s)]
*  We are still waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that we can determine [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=351.38s)]
*  after a ridiculous expenditure of billions of dollars how many radicalized lunatics, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  all should not be let back into our country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=363.9s)]
*  Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents and probably for good reason! [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=366.82s)]
*  The best thing Harvard has going for it is that they have shopped around for the absolute [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=372.9s)]
*  best job for them, but have no fear, the government will in the end win! [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=377.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is a fascist. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=384.38s)]
*  The question is not are we creeping into authoritarianism. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=386.41999999999996s)]
*  We have an authoritarian regime in the United States. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  That's how the rest of the world views the behavior like this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=392.74s)]
*  And an authoritarian regime that resembles a more idiotic version than North Korea. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=396.5s)]
*  When you see Donald Trump making posts like this, have no fear in all caps. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=402.58s)]
*  And as Donald Trump attacks the federal judges and goes, these are good federal judges for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=406.86s)]
*  them, but have no fear, there's a reason why the federal judges who were appointed [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=411.54s)]
*  by both Democrats, Republicans, appointed by Trump appointees, Obama appointees, Biden [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=417.38s)]
*  appointees, Clinton appointees, George W. Bush appointees, want the marshals, the federal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=422.94s)]
*  marshal services to be removed from the executive branch and moved over to the judiciary because [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=428.26s)]
*  they fear that the US marshals protecting them from the death threats are going to kill [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=436.1s)]
*  them because of Donald Trump. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=441.7s)]
*  Because actually they are worried that the marshals will target them if the marshals [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=444.02s)]
*  work for this maniac. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=448.34s)]
*  So we're not heading into a constitutional crisis or in one. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=449.9s)]
*  We're past that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=454.02s)]
*  We're at authoritarian regime stage and a loser one who each day is destroying the United [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=455.02s)]
*  States of America. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=460.85999999999996s)]
*  So you ever sit down to work and your brain just won't cooperate? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=462.5s)]
*  That was me for so long. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  I find myself getting distracted scrolling through social media, just totally unable [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=466.82s)]
*  to focus. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  Especially with a job like this where I need to stay locked in, productive, creative, and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=471.42s)]
*  on top of the news, distractions aren't just annoying. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=475.1s)]
*  They can derail everything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=477.94s)]
*  Then I found Brain FM and it's been a game changer. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=479.62s)]
*  Brain FM is an app built for anyone seeking to boost productivity. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=482.26s)]
*  They create science back music that syncs brain patterns, helping you focus better, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  relax deeper and sleep easier. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  I use their deep work and creative modes daily. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=491.14s)]
*  It's like flipping a switch in my brain. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=493.42s)]
*  There's even a turbo mode specifically designed for ADHD support. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=495.94s)]

*  I'm considering taking $3 billion of grant money away from the very anti-Semitic Harvard [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=524.3000000000001s)]

*  And so badly needed! [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=536.62s)]
*  You know who invested in trade schools and didn't make ridiculous posts like that invoking [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=539.14s)]
*  anti-Semitism so that you can then go ahead and spread your actual propaganda and lies [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=544.22s)]

*  Harvard is the number one university in the United States. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=561.62s)]
*  It is a place where foreign students go and where American students go and where we see [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=564.38s)]
*  a lot of people. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=571.38s)]

*  You've been blocked by federal judges thus far. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=584.78s)]
*  And so here you are now saying, I'm considering taking, do what you want to do. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=587.62s)]

*  who doesn't take no, an abuser and everything the way he just tries to mock people and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=614.2s)]
*  toy with people. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=621.84s)]
*  This is a sick, vile piece of trash individual. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=623.24s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=627.24s)]
*  Just call him out for it each and every time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=628.24s)]

*  This is a shit person right here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=636.76s)]
*  Then he goes and says the following, our nation is staging one of the greatest, fastest comebacks [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=638.84s)]
*  in history. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=643.94s)]
*  In just four months, we are respected again, respected like never before. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=644.94s)]
*  And just wait with many trillions of dollars of investment in plants and factories until [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=648.6400000000001s)]
*  you see the numbers of growth. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=652.94s)]
*  This is indeed the golden age of America. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=654.58s)]
*  You actually reversed the investments in factories from former president Biden and the budget [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=656.48s)]
*  bill if it passed is going to rip away 14 million healthcare from 14 million Americans, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=661.82s)]
*  food assistance, food stamps from tens of millions of Americans, rental assistance from [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=667.8800000000001s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=672.88s)]
*  You have negative economic growth in the first quarter as a result of your deranged behavior. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  And now the rest of the international world is basically isolating the United States and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=680.8399999999999s)]
*  tourism is down substantially. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=685.3599999999999s)]
*  This may have been the worst, not may, it has been the worst, what is it now? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=687.2199999999999s)]
*  Close to 120 whatever days plus in the history of the United States of America. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=692.12s)]
*  Then he goes, countries from all over the world want to make trade deals with us. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=698.4s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing to see. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=702.3s)]
*  The good old USA will have tremendous growth and be stronger than ever before. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=703.9s)]
*  We had trade deals with these countries, you idiot. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  We had trade deals with all of them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=710.8599999999999s)]
*  You broke the trade deals, imposed tariffs on what you called liquidation or you call [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=713.0999999999999s)]
*  Liberation Day. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=718.5s)]
*  I call it liquidation day or Great Depression Day. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=719.5s)]
*  And you broke the deals and now you haven't been able to fix any of the deals that you [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=723.54s)]
*  broke. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=727.74s)]
*  Then he goes, make America great again. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=728.74s)]
*  And then here is one post that he made yesterday as well that I want to just reflect on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=730.78s)]
*  Where he goes, I've always had a very good relationship with Putin of Russia, but something [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=735.14s)]
*  has happened to him. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=739.42s)]
*  He has gone absolutely crazy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=740.86s)]
*  He is needlessly killing a lot of people and I'm not just talking about soldiers, missiles [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=742.98s)]
*  and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=747.0999999999999s)]
*  I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=750.66s)]
*  And maybe that's proving to be right. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  But if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=755.38s)]
*  Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=758.1s)]
*  Everything out of his mouth causes problems. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=764.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't like it and it better stop. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=765.78s)]
*  This is a war that would never have started if I were president. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=767.82s)]
*  This is Zelensky's, Putin's and Biden's war, not Trump's. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=770.78s)]
*  I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires that have been started through gross [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=773.74s)]
*  incompetence and hatred. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=778.14s)]
*  Our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, he never stopped. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=780.02s)]
*  He laughed at Trump and continued the killing because Trump is an international joke and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=783.26s)]
*  his foreign policy team is filled with bumbling, weak, appeasing incompetence. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=788.22s)]
*  Probably not the best decision to send the chief negotiator to Russia. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=793.66s)]
*  One of Trump's real estate buddies, Steve Wittkopf, who didn't even bring his own translator [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=799.74s)]
*  with him and use the Russian intelligence officer as the American translator, then put [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=805.08s)]
*  heart in obsequiousness to Putin. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=811.02s)]
*  You see Donald Trump attacking Zelensky in that message as well. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=813.66s)]
*  You see Donald Trump taking no responsibility as well. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=817.06s)]
*  I don't like the way Zelensky is talking. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=819.9s)]
*  What do you mean you don't like the way he's talking? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  You mean that you don't like the way that he's upset that another nation has invaded [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=823.48s)]
*  his nation and is committing a genocide and is killing all of the innocent people in Ukraine? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=828.1s)]
*  You don't like the way he's speaking? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=832.74s)]
*  You know why you don't like the way he's speaking, Donald, going back to the first [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=834.66s)]
*  post, because you don't even know what the hell service is. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  You don't know what it means to actually care about a country, frankly. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=840.64s)]
*  You don't know what it means to care about anything other than yourself and your money, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=844.08s)]
*  you greedy, selfish, vile piece of trash. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=849.52s)]
*  So my message to you on Memorial Day, Donald Trump, is you are an absolute disgrace of [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=853.24s)]
*  a human being. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=860.32s)]
*  Period. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=862.24s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=863.24s)]
*  is that we all need to also remember the sacrifices served by our great men and women and people [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=865.24s)]
*  who have risked it all, who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1toorT0Hd4&t=873.64s)]
