# Trump’s ENTIRE White House CRUMBLES as IT ALL CRACKS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M)
*  You had people walking out of Donald Trump's disastrous speech in Pittsburgh early, while [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=0.0s)]
*  he basically lied about everything, to steelworkers for US Steel who are about to have their lives [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=5.54s)]
*  ruined by Donald Trump and they don't even fully realize it yet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=11.86s)]
*  You have physical altercations breaking out in the White House, with Treasury Secretary [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Scott Besant getting into a physical fight with Elon Musk. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=21.34s)]
*  You have Elon Musk showing up in the Oval Office for some bizarre press conference with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=25.68s)]
*  a black eye on the heels of a New York Times story saying he would consistently abuse ketamine [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=31.64s)]
*  and mushrooms while he was destroying the federal government and destroying your life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=38.7s)]
*  You had Elon Musk looking like he was in some condition that clearly looked very impaired, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=44.32s)]
*  and again, this is the person destroying your life and your family's life. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=51.66s)]
*  You have Donald Trump saying that he's now imposing a 50% across-the-board tariff on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  steel into the United States, which will cause tens of thousands of jobs here in the United [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=62.04s)]
*  States, hundreds of thousands, possibly as a lot of our manufacturers domestically buy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=68.86s)]
*  steel as a component part for the things that they're building also. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  It should be noted that Donald Trump, when he would build buildings or when he would [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=79.18s)]
*  slop his name onto buildings, he would frequently use Chinese steel, which he called shoddy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=84.30000000000001s)]
*  today, but that's the type of steel that he would use. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=91.42s)]
*  You have Donald Trump getting mocked internationally as the international community calls him a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=94.86000000000001s)]
*  taco. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=101.5s)]
*  Should we do a choose-your-own-adventure? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=102.5s)]
*  Where do you want to start? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Okay, why don't we start quickly in India where Donald Trump is getting mocked as a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=106.34s)]
*  taco. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  Trump always chickens out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  This is, I'm not going to show you like 10 seconds of it, but this goes on for like three [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=114.22s)]
*  minutes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=117.78s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump being called a taco on India TV. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=118.78s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=122.26s)]
*  Oh, and then I chicken out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=136.34s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=145.1s)]
*  All right, let's take a look at Elon's condition with a black eye and looking like he's under [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=148.1s)]
*  the influence of something in the Oval Office. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=158.86s)]
*  Let's just play this clip of Elon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=162.06s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=164.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's bad. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=165.06s)]
*  It's embarrassing to our nation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=188.7s)]
*  Elon's done so much to embarrass himself already, but the fact that that's an individual who [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=192.06s)]
*  destroyed our federal government killed likely hundreds of thousands of people based on the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=197.62s)]
*  cuts that were made at USAID and other things. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=203.22s)]
*  Really just an unforgivable, putrid human being. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=206.7s)]
*  Of course, the putrid human being next to him, Donald Trump, was giving that speech [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=209.82s)]
*  that I talked about at the outset of this video, this disastrous speech at US Steel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are claiming that Nippon Steel is not acquiring [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=220.78s)]
*  US Steel, that it's some partnership or some investment. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  It's just more lies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=230.66s)]
*  Show me the deal, because the deal I'm aware of from 2024 was a deal whereby Nippon Steel [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=232.38s)]
*  acquires, buys, purchases US Steel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  And that's why allegedly Trump was against it, why former President Biden rejected it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=243.66s)]
*  But here's Donald Trump lying and saying that he also cut the deficit in half already, that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  he's cut the deficit in half. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=254.9s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=256.5s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump has added to the deficit. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=269.5s)]
*  The deficit has increased under Donald Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=272.06s)]
*  Federal spending has increased under Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=275.06s)]
*  It's worse. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=280.3s)]
*  And then when you factor in what's going to happen with this disastrous budget bill, it's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=281.42s)]
*  going to add trillions and trillions to the deficit and really destroy America's long-term [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=285.42s)]
*  potential. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=292.18s)]
*  Speaking about destroying America's long-term potential, I'll give you a brief primer in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=293.3s)]
*  some individuals who are immigrants who are now leading top American corporations, who [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  studied in the United States. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  Nvidia's CEO, AMD CEO, Intel CEO, Broadcom CEO, Alphabet CEO, Microsoft CEO are all Asian [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=307.82000000000005s)]
*  immigrants who have contributed to the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=317.54s)]
*  And under Donald Trump's policies, people like that will be blocked. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think the American people are getting it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=324.94000000000005s)]
*  I think with all of this corporate news BS that's out there, you still have in the generic [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=327.7s)]
*  poll by Atlas Intel, and they were the most reliable pollsters in the past election, Atlas [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=336.9s)]
*  Intel was, in a generic ballot poll, and this is an A plus poll, they have Democrats up [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=342.34s)]
*  by 9, 51% to 42% Democrats in the lead. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  And if you think about just even politics is a game of addition, not subtraction, just [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=356.18s)]
*  think about the ultimate betrayal that happened at the end of last week, where the Supreme [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=363.98s)]
*  Court at Donald Trump's request removed additional temporary protected status from 500,000 Cubans, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=368.66s)]
*  Venezuelans, and Haitians. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=377.06s)]
*  This is on top of the prior Supreme Court ruling getting rid of temporary protected [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=379.98s)]
*  status for just the Venezuelans. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=384.34s)]
*  And you all remember the Cubans for Trump, the Venezuelans for Trump, and they said Donald [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=386.4s)]
*  Trump's never going to go after us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=392.46s)]
*  He's only going to go after criminals. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=394.61999999999995s)]
*  He's not going to revoke our parole status, our temporary protected status that former [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=396.78s)]
*  President Biden gave them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=402.2s)]
*  Well, y'all attacked former President Biden who gave you the parole status, the temporary [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  protected status to be here, to have thriving lives in the United States. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=410.3s)]
*  And Donald Trump took it away. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=416.42s)]
*  So I don't know what other issues are on your list of issues that are important. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=417.62s)]
*  I'm just saying on the one hand, Biden allowed you to live here and live successful lives, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=422.66s)]
*  pay taxes, have a job, become a contributing member to the United States of America, and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=427.94s)]
*  maybe one day a citizen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=434.82s)]
*  Donald Trump just ripped that from you and he wants to send you back to Castro. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=436.86s)]
*  He wants to send you back to a Maduro. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=440.82s)]
*  That's what's really going on. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=445.26s)]
*  I'll share this with you also to kind of show you the ultimate weakness of Donald Trump. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=447.34s)]
*  Here he is right here at various times talking about when it comes to Putin, two weeks. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=451.84s)]
*  You know, what was it? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=457.38s)]
*  March, April, May. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=458.38s)]
*  I just need two more weeks. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=459.38s)]
*  Give me two more weeks, everybody. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=460.74s)]
*  So utterly pathetic here. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=462.78s)]
*  Play that clip. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=464.38s)]
*  You crushed President Putin, you know, in about two weeks. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=465.98s)]
*  Is Ukraine doing enough to get this? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=468.98s)]
*  I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=471.98s)]
*  You keep saying two weeks about President Putin. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=474.98s)]
*  What is two weeks? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=477.98s)]
*  Give us what is the actual date? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=478.98s)]
*  What is the timeline? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=480.98s)]
*  Two weeks or less. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=481.98s)]
*  And if it's a little more at the time, I say, but you know, they're losing a lot of people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=482.98s)]
*  See those little dates up at the top. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=487.98s)]
*  April 27th, May 19th. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=489.98s)]
*  Today is May 28th. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=491.7s)]
*  So two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=493.78s)]
*  Now we're still two weeks away. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=494.98s)]
*  And then finally, you know, I'll show you this one other portion of Donald Trump's press [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=496.58000000000004s)]
*  conference with Elon Musk, which is again, it's just so utterly pathetic and it's so [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=502.18s)]
*  beneath contempt. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=508.18s)]
*  But let me just show it to you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=509.18s)]
*  He's been able to find it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=510.18s)]
*  Eight million dollars for making mice transgender. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=511.18s)]
*  So they spent eight million dollars on making mice transgender. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=514.98s)]
*  And those are better than many of those. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=519.78s)]
*  Because I could sit here all day and read things just like that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=522.78s)]
*  But we have other things to do. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvFrbH0iR-M&t=525.98s)]
