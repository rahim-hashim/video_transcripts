# Trump gets SHOCKINGLY BAD NEWS about IOWA VOTERS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs)
*  So I showed video yesterday at an Iowa town hall where the crowd was booing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congresswoman who was attacking their Medicaid and defending this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=6.4s)]
*  disastrous budget bill. And let's face it, it gave me some hope. But then I went back and I looked [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=12.64s)]
*  at the numbers in Iowa and I wanted to see, did, what did Donald Trump win by? What was the, where [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=18.56s)]
*  are we starting from here? So I looked in 2024 and I saw that Donald Trump got 55% of the vote [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  to former Vice President Kamala Harris's 42% of the vote. I went back and looked at the primaries [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=33.28s)]
*  in the Iowa caucuses and I saw that Trump's margin of victory in the Iowa GOP caucus [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=39.36s)]
*  beat previous records there. And then I also remembered some of the speeches that Donald [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=45.36s)]
*  Trump would give in Iowa right before the caucus was set to take place, where Donald Trump would [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=50.56s)]
*  say to the people who were there, like this was his final pitch. Even if you, because the weather [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=55.92s)]
*  wasn't that good, even if you're really sick and you're going to die, vote for me and then die after. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  And I'm like, that's the message that kind of, that worked. Let me just remind you of what he said. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=67.28s)]
*  Here, play this clip. You gotta get out. You can't sit home. If you're sick as a dog, you say, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=73.92s)]
*  darling, I got to thank you. Even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=80.72s)]
*  That's like legitimately a crazy thing to say. And, but yet there was a record, record turnout. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=85.92s)]
*  To then give me, go back to my hope, I saw a Republican Congresswoman Hinson get booed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=92.32s)]
*  yesterday as she tried to defend this disastrous budget bill, which objectively is going to hurt [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=98.56s)]
*  Iowa, which reminds you about the booing. Play this clip. I was also proud to vote for President [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=103.76s)]
*  Trump's one big, beautiful bill last week. This is a generational investment. This is a general [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=109.04s)]
*  investment. This is your time. Okay. So then I tried to look at the headlines and say, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  all right, well, what's going on in Iowa right now? Well, health insurance for millions could [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=125.44s)]
*  vanish in the state of Iowa as Trump attacks Medicaid. I looked at it and I see how Trump's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=130.24s)]
*  tariffs are threatening Iowa's agriculture industry. I'm trying to get a sense of what [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=136.96s)]
*  the farmers are saying, and it feels kind of a bit mixed. But then I'm thinking, okay, well, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=142.56s)]
*  what's the current governor Kim Reynolds doing? And she's focusing on DEI, DEI, attack DEI, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=148.16s)]
*  attack DEI, and pretend the other stuff isn't really happening. And then I'm thinking, okay, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  well, what's Donald Trump doing? And he's still doing that ridiculous lawsuit against the Des [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=159.12s)]
*  Moines Register because he didn't like the Iowa poll. But then I'm thinking, this is the Midas [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=163.04s)]
*  Touch Network, and we can actually get experts and people who could tell us what's really going on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=168.4s)]
*  in the state. And so I figured, why don't I call Rob Sand? Rob is the Iowa auditor for the state, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=173.68s)]
*  and before that he was the assistant attorney general in Iowa. Rob is running for the gubernatorial [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=180.16s)]
*  seat in Iowa in 2026. And so I asked you, Mr. Rob Sand, as I show you that data from 2024, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=186.88s)]
*  is that daunting? How are you going to flip the script there? And how are you going to win [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=196.48s)]
*  in what's otherwise appears to me to be a red state? Sure. Look, I think, first of all, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=202.0s)]
*  thanks for having me. I think there's a couple of easy answers here, right? Kansas, Democratic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=207.6s)]
*  governor, re-elected. Kentucky, Democratic governor, re-elected. Those states, if we're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=215.2s)]
*  just using red and blue, are both way redder than the state of Iowa. And so yeah, we can win here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think that part of the point is taking the focus actually off of the national politics [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=228.72s)]
*  and try to talk to Iowans about what is going on in Iowa. That's how I have already won statewide [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  here twice in 2018 and in 2022 when no one else did, just by being focused on what Iowans care [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=240.72s)]
*  about and what's happening in Des Moines, right? Because they understand the difference. They get [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=247.28s)]
*  it. And even if they like parts of what are happening in DC, there's a lot more going on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=251.44s)]
*  in Des Moines that they do not like. You know, it's interesting, right? When we recently covered the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=257.84s)]
*  Omaha, Nebraska mayoral race, for example, where they are the longest serving Republican [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=262.88s)]
*  mayor, all focused on DEI, bathrooms, and the Democratic candidate who ended up winning, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=268.72s)]
*  flipped that, was 20 points Republican, was like, let's focus on just better roads. Like, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=276.8s)]
*  let's just focus on helping the people. And it is interesting to see in Iowa, the Republicans [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=282.56s)]
*  focusing on these national culture war issues while you're focusing on what's really going on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  in the state. So talk to us. Tell us the issues that you're focused on in Iowa and what matters [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=295.04s)]
*  and contrast that to the people you're going to be running against. Oh, absolutely. And I think [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=299.92s)]
*  that's part of the reason that we believe we can win this race is that after 10 years of one-party [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=304.32s)]
*  control in the state of Iowa, they are focused completely on insiders and special interest groups. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=308.72s)]
*  They have forgotten about Iowans. What am I talking about? Well, here's what ordinary Iowans are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  dealing with, rising costs that are compounded by having the 49th worst economy in the entire [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=318.8s)]
*  country, according to the Trump administration. We are 48th worst for personal income growth. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=325.04s)]
*  Our education system, which has always been in the top three in the state when I was growing up in a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=331.36s)]
*  small town in Northeast Iowa, now it's in the middle of the pack. But for cancer growth, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=336.72s)]
*  for the growth in cancers, we are number one. But what have they been doing in 10 years? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=342.4s)]
*  They have in 10 years gutted the auditor's office ability to find misspent money, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=349.44s)]
*  literally made it legal for state agencies to hide documents from the auditor's office. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=354.8s)]
*  Because in my first term, we uncovered a record amount of misspent money and they decided they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=359.44s)]
*  didn't want to be held accountable. They instituted a school vouchers program that has no accountability, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  no oversight for how that money gets spent. And they have pursued all these culture war issues [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=370.48s)]
*  at the expense of the bottom line of Iowans. And I think Iowans are sick of that. They want things [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=377.36s)]
*  to turn around in Des Moines. They want the Iowan that they, for folks like me, that they [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=382.24s)]
*  remember growing up with that was just focused on common sats. And after 10 years of one party [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  control, they've lost that. They've lost touch. And the bottom line is very simple. They're not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=391.36s)]
*  necessarily interested, and I'm not necessarily interested, in making Iowa blue or redder. It's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=396.8s)]
*  more about making it truer and better. And there's a lot of people in this state who have always [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=401.68s)]
*  consistently been willing to vote for candidates of either party, depending on who they think is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=406.08s)]
*  going to do a better job of doing that. Well, that's your slogan, Governor for all. It isn't [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=409.92s)]
*  Governor for blue or Governor for you. It's Governor for all. But while you're traveling [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=414.8s)]
*  the state right now, are you, you've, as you mentioned, ran for state office twice, and won [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=420.56s)]
*  18 and then 2022. Do you see a shift there, though, even right now, from what you saw before? And can [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=427.68s)]
*  you describe what you're actually seeing on the ground among the voters? Absolutely. And I think [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=434.56s)]
*  the easiest way to encapsulate this is what we've seen in the last year. The top three special [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=440.0s)]
*  election performances in the entire country this year happened to be the three that were special [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=446.24s)]
*  elections in the state of Iowa. There is the shift happening here. It's not a coincidence that we have [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=453.04s)]
*  had three special elections and that all three of them are literally the top three over performances. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=459.52s)]
*  And I think this comes down to just, in a lot of the ways, again, it goes back to the fact that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=464.88s)]
*  Iowans are much more elastic. They're more results focused. They are more [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=470.64s)]
*  candidate focused. And a lot of them like someone who's really oriented on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=478.8s)]
*  blowing up politics as usual. And frankly, that's a thing that the President and I have in common. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=485.36s)]
*  I've always said, you know, when I ran in 18 and when I ran in 22, I prosecuted Democrats and I [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=492.0s)]
*  prosecuted Republicans because I was the chief public corruption prosecutor in my seven years as [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=498.16s)]
*  assistant attorney general prior to becoming an elected state auditor. I've always talked about [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=505.92s)]
*  the fact that, you know, we shouldn't be feeling like we have to fit in people's boxes, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=510.48s)]
*  That the two party system, the two choice system is not one that is a natural one because we all [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  know that there's more than two ways to think. That resonates with Iowans. I think that people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=521.76s)]
*  appreciate that here, maybe in a larger proportion than they do in other states, I can't say. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=526.48s)]
*  But it's certainly a piece of who I am. And my trick, if there is one, has always just said to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=531.36s)]
*  be honest with people about what I think, be honest about who I am. And that seems to be working so far. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=537.44s)]
*  You know, when people ask me, well, you know, what should the messaging be or what should this be? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=542.96s)]
*  You know, one of the things I always say is that I said people don't really like politics. People [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=548.24s)]
*  really want to just know who's fighting for them. And so you're right. There is an appealing message [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=555.36s)]
*  of blowing up a political system and blowing up a political establishment. But then the issue is, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=561.28s)]
*  is the collateral damage of that going to be the people while the billionaires are the ones who [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=567.04s)]
*  are actually benefiting? Or do you blow up a political system that benefits the oligarchs [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=572.88s)]
*  and the billionaires so that the people, the stats that you just listed where I was in last [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=578.32s)]
*  and then in first for the bad things and last for the good things that that gets switched? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=585.12s)]
*  So as we conclude this interview, tell us how are you going to blow up the system for the good [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=590.72s)]
*  as opposed to blow it up and have a situation where there's more chaos? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=598.24s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think this is pretty simple. I frankly, I'm a believer that neither party [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=602.0s)]
*  does a good enough job of actually solving problems to deserve the monopoly that they [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=609.04s)]
*  have on our choices. I think we ought to have an open primary. Right now in the state of Iowa, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=613.6s)]
*  we tell independent voters that they don't get to participate. We ought to have an open primary. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=618.96s)]
*  We ought to send four people to the general election or five. And then in the general, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=623.12s)]
*  just say, yeah, here's all the candidates vote for each of them that you approve of. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=627.68s)]
*  You no longer feel like you have to only pick one. It's not the lesser of two evils that's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=632.88s)]
*  supporting every candidate. He feels worthy of your support. And whoever has the most people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=636.88s)]
*  that support them wins. This would do a lot to incentivize stability in our politics because all [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=641.04s)]
*  of a sudden it's not that candidates can say to themselves because this is this is the truth. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=646.16s)]
*  Right. We all know this in the system of the lesser of two evils. A lot of consultants, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=650.4s)]
*  a lot of cynical candidates, they'll say, well, you don't have to convince everybody that you're [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZelzEuyKMs&t=655.76s)]
