# SICKLY Trump has FRANTIC MELTDOWN as WALLS CLOSE IN
**MeidasTouch:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw)
*  frenzied, panicking throughout all of last night Donald Trump posting and posting things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=0.0s)]
*  like this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=6.08s)]
*  I am pleased to announce that the United States tariff letters and or deals with various countries [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=7.08s)]
*  from around the world will be delivered starting at 12 p.m. Eastern Monday, July 7th. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=19.72s)]
*  The letters and or deals, what in the world are you talking about? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  You said 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=25.86s)]
*  Now you're just going to send letters to countries saying what their tariffs are going to be? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=28.2s)]
*  How pathetic is this? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=32.28s)]
*  Oh, and then Donald Trump posted the following last night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=33.28s)]
*  Any country aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS will be charged an additional [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=36.72s)]
*  10% tariff. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=44.08s)]
*  There will be no exceptions to this policy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=47.96s)]
*  What is the policy? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=50.44s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=51.44s)]
*  So is there an additional 10% tariff on China? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=52.44s)]
*  Is there an additional 10% tariff on India? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=56.32s)]
*  Aren't you trying to negotiate a deal with India? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=59.64s)]
*  What in the world are you doing right now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=62.56s)]
*  Do you even know what BRICS is? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=65.56s)]
*  And as we're learning more horrible and tragic news about what happened in Kerr County, Texas, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=67.84s)]
*  more on that in a moment and these systemic failures that seem to have occurred there, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  what is the Trump regime talking about? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=80.16s)]
*  They've been repeating this over and over again with the UFC yesterday confirming Trump's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=83.72s)]
*  plan to host a fight at the White House in 2026. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=91.4s)]
*  Trump said he wants the card to be held in front of more than 20,000 people as part of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=96.12s)]
*  a celebration honoring America's 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=101.24s)]
*  I can't think of anything more embarrassing to the United States than if that takes place. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=107.2s)]
*  Perhaps Donald Trump being there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=112.08s)]
*  The UFC plans to host a fight card on the White House grounds. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=114.52s)]
*  A spokesperson for the promotion confirmed to NBC News further details were not available, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=118.64s)]
*  but Trump said he would like it as part of the celebration for July 4, 2026 honoring [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=123.84s)]
*  America's 250th birthday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to have a UFC fight on the grounds of the White House, Trump said in Des Moines, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=131.56s)]
*  Iowa. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=135.96s)]
*  We have a lot of land there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=136.96s)]
*  He said he expects the card to include a fight in front of 20,000 to 25,000 people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=138.32s)]
*  Every one of our national parks, battlefields, and historic sites are going to have special [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=143.8s)]
*  events and we're going to have a UFC fight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=148.64s)]
*  It's not clear how far along the planning the event is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=151.16s)]
*  A UFC spokesperson said more details will be released in due time, well at least I didn't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=154.76s)]
*  say two weeks. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=159.84s)]
*  Then, Conor McGregor, who has not competed, said, I would be honored. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=160.84s)]
*  Count me in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=165.44s)]
*  What they're doing right now, now is reported that 78 deaths in Kerr County, Texas from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=166.52s)]
*  the horrible flash floods as a result of the storms there where local officials were saying [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=174.6s)]
*  they did not get the forecast that they needed or the forecast did not predict the amount [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=180.16s)]
*  of rain. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=185.16s)]
*  We know about all of the unfilled vacancies at the National Weather Service positions, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=186.16s)]
*  including their lead meteorologist coordinator in that Kerr County region who had 32 years [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=192.44s)]
*  of experience who was basically pushed out by Doge, a guy by the name of Paul Yura. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=199.84s)]
*  While Donald Trump's talking about UFC, here's what it looked like in Kerr County. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=207.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=212.96s)]
*  Now, at the Midas Touch Network, when we had the facts, we did not hesitate to report on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  what was happening with the cuts to the National Weather Service and NOAA, the National Oceanic [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=228.96s)]
*  Atmospheric Administration, also with the Trump regime's cuts to FEMA. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  You know by watching this network, how long have we been talking about FEMA almost every [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=238.46s)]
*  single day since January? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=243.16s)]
*  We did segments on FEMA, on NOAA, on NWS and all of this stuff. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=246.06s)]
*  And finally, New York Times wrote yesterday, as floods hit, key roles were vacant at Weather [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=250.6s)]
*  Service offices in Texas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=256.2s)]
*  Some experts say staff shortages might have complicated forecasters' ability to coordinate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=258.44s)]
*  responses with local emergency management officials. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=264.04s)]
*  And I think part of the key operative words there, coordinate response with local emergency [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=267.52s)]
*  management officials. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=273.2s)]
*  It does seem that some alert went out saying there's going to be flash floods by the National [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=274.2s)]
*  Weather Service, but that's just a post. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=280.24s)]
*  That's not the robust federal coordination that's supposed to take place. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=283.0s)]
*  You see, NOAA, NWS, FEMA are all supposed to work together and basically take the lead [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=286.68s)]
*  with the states. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=293.72s)]
*  The states aren't supposed to be taking the lead. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  The states don't know how to run things like this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=297.2s)]
*  That's not what states are equipped for. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=299.52s)]
*  This is why you, one of the reasons you have a federal government, and here it seems the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=301.2s)]
*  Trump regime, again, they said they want to eliminate FEMA. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=304.88s)]
*  They just want to push all this to the states. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=308.0s)]
*  And if you do that, the states don't know what they're doing in this area. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=310.08s)]
*  So we have that happening as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=313.72s)]
*  It should be noted, remember all of those posts I made at the outset about Trump saying [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  he's sending letters to the countries. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to do another video on this this morning, so keep checking back because I'll [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=321.16s)]
*  give you a comprehensive report. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=325.12s)]
*  But Prime Minister Aishiba of Japan is saying, we will not easily concede in trade negotiations [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=327.62s)]
*  with America, standing up for themselves in Japan. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=334.44s)]
*  While all of this is going on too, remember how Donald Trump back in May entered into [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=338.11999999999995s)]
*  a ceasefire with the Houthis. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  And remember he said they're brave and courageous people, the Houthis, a terrorist group that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=345.88s)]
*  is funded by Iran, you're saying is brave and courageous people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=350.28s)]
*  And remember Donald Trump declared victory and said that it's all good. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=353.96s)]
*  We're going to be able to use the Red Sea. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=357.52s)]
*  We'll be able to traverse the Red Sea. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  There hasn't been a single American flag commercial ship that's been able to cross [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  through the Red Sea. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  And then the Houthis set a ship on fire with a drone boat attack over the weekend, showing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  that remember all the strikes on the Houthis that remember like Pete Hegseth, lethality, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=374.44s)]
*  this is how you do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  We destroyed him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=380.84s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=381.84s)]
*  The same way you did not obliterate all of the nuclear facilities in Iran. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=383.28s)]
*  Y'all are just a bunch of liars over and over again. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=388.0s)]
*  Trump was asked, he was golfing, of course, this past weekend in Bedminster. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=391.44s)]
*  How he was spending his time golfing during this tragedy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=396.92s)]
*  And then on Friday he was dancing to the YMCA when the scale and scope of the tragedy was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=400.6s)]
*  indeed known as horrific. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=406.16s)]
*  So he was in Bedminster flying back to DC and he was asked, are you still planning on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  phasing out FEMA? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=414.12s)]
*  With all that we know now, are you going to phase out FEMA? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=415.9s)]
*  And he doesn't rule out phasing out FEMA. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=418.88s)]
*  But there always have been all these statements. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=421.26s)]
*  Him and Kristi Noem over and over again said they want to eliminate FEMA. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=423.02s)]
*  But here he is on the tarmac. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=426.5s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=427.5s)]
*  Are you still planning to phase out FEMA? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=428.5s)]
*  Well FEMA is something we can talk about later. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  But right now they're busy working. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=436.85999999999996s)]
*  So we'll leave it at that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=438.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=439.9s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's asked the most basic question. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=441.14s)]
*  Do you think we should hire back the meteorologist who do the weather forecasts and do the coordination [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  with local officials? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=450.29999999999995s)]
*  He goes, no, I don't think so. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=451.29999999999995s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=453.85999999999996s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=455.85999999999996s)]
*  In light of the floods, do you think that the federal government needs to hire back [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  any of the meteorologists who were fired in the last two months? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=461.85999999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't know that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=465.85999999999996s)]
*  I really wouldn't. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  I would think not. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=467.85999999999996s)]
*  This was the thing that happened in seconds. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=468.94s)]
*  Nobody expected it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=471.42s)]
*  Nobody saw it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=472.42s)]
*  Very talented people are there and they didn't see it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=473.42s)]
*  I guess they said once in a hundred years they've never seen anything like this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  So I wouldn't, I mean people are trying to blame the school. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=481.26s)]
*  They're trying to blame the camp. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  They're trying to blame. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  It's just a horrible thing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  But no, I wouldn't say that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=489.7s)]
*  But for the propaganda media outlets like the New York Post, this is a big win. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=491.94s)]
*  Tired of winning it? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  Trump caps two-week victory streak with big beautiful triumph. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=498.62s)]
*  That's how New York Post is reporting it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=502.86s)]
*  You mean that 17 million Americans are going to get kicked off of Medicaid? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  That's what you're celebrating? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=508.94s)]
*  That we're going to add trillions to our debt? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=510.3s)]
*  That's what you're celebrating? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=513.66s)]
*  That people are going to be taking off supplemental nutrition assistance? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  That's what you're celebrating? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=519.34s)]
*  So that billionaires can get tax cuts when they already have amassed so much wealth. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=520.34s)]
*  We have to now give them the largest redistribution of wealth in the history of the country and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=527.26s)]
*  perhaps the world of low-income working class Americans to the super rich. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=532.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=537.06s)]
*  Why are we doing that? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=538.06s)]
*  It makes zero. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=539.06s)]
*  Oh, because that's who Donald Trump represents. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=540.66s)]
*  They're the oligarchs. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=543.54s)]
*  Here's the types of emails that Donald Trump was sending yesterday, scammy emails like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=545.86s)]
*  this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=549.86s)]
*  And I subscribe to his email so you don't have to. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=550.86s)]
*  But I want to see, like, what's he saying to his supporters? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  This was from yesterday afternoon at 4.03. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=556.04s)]
*  I left a voicemail for, fill in the blank of the name of the supporter. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=558.24s)]
*  Here it says Ben, because I subscribe so you don't have to. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=561.88s)]
*  Then it goes transcribed voice message from Trump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  And then it gives his supporters a fake transcribed voice message. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=567.74s)]
*  Do they think this is real? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=571.48s)]
*  And it goes, I have five minutes until my next meeting starts, so I'm going to make [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=573.24s)]
*  this quick. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=576.16s)]
*  Here are three reasons I need your support before midnight. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=577.16s)]
*  I really mean that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=579.56s)]
*  It's because you and you alone and our administration is securing win after win for the people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  The first reason is that I need your help building up the Trump war chest for the midterms. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=585.8s)]
*  We've got to protect our congressional and senate majority. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=590.8s)]
*  The second reason is that Democrats are suing my administration left and right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=593.56s)]
*  They hate that I'm putting you first. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=597.16s)]
*  The final reason is that I'll enter you to win a free set of gold Trump golf balls. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  I hope you haven't given up on my mission to put America first. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=604.88s)]
*  If you haven't, will you do me a huge favor? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=608.04s)]
*  Chip in $25? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's not a free set of gold golf balls. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=612.4s)]
*  People are paying $25. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=618.3599999999999s)]
*  Remember his post back on February 21st, 2025 in response to this breaking Epstein files [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=619.3599999999999s)]
*  are going to be released. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  AG Bondi has said this would include a client list per the New York Post to which Don Jr. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  went LFG. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=634.52s)]
*  Well, yesterday Axios, our friend Alex Eisenstadt, got the exclusive. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=635.52s)]
*  DOJ, FBI conclude Epstein has no client list and that he died by suicide. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=641.4000000000001s)]
*  So the Trump regime now claims there is no Epstein list. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  It never existed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  Sure, Jan, Jan, sure, never existed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=652.44s)]
*  That's what they're going with. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=657.72s)]
*  Because Trump's name is all over the files. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=658.72s)]
*  I've done a hundred videos on Trump's connections with Epstein's. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=661.76s)]
*  Go back. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  I did one last night, but you'll see for yourself. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=665.4000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, what are the MAGA Republicans doing? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=667.6400000000001s)]
*  They're making posts like this. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=670.16s)]
*  I'm not sure if they're in this photo, but they now go swimming with Trump's face on [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=671.52s)]
*  floaties in the pool. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=676.8s)]
*  There's nothing else I need to say about that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=679.68s)]
*  And then they go, the European mind could never comprehend. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=681.44s)]
*  Yeah, no mind can never comprehend. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=684.4s)]
*  What the hell are you doing? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=686.64s)]
*  Why are you swimming with Trump floaties around your body? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=687.64s)]
*  That's freaking weird. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=691.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=693.12s)]
*  And then I'll leave you with this right here. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=694.12s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent morning interviews. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=695.64s)]
*  What has he been saying? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=700.0s)]
*  He said that the Trump regime never promised 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=701.36s)]
*  And he also said that no one is, that not a lot of countries have been calling. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=706.12s)]
*  So let me do this. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=711.48s)]
*  Let me share with you the split screen of what the regime was saying with their chief [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=712.72s)]
*  propagandist, Caroline Levitt. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=716.52s)]
*  Then I'll show you what Bessent was saying so you can see the side by side. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=718.56s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=721.76s)]
*  And now the rest of the world is calling our administration. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=722.76s)]
*  The phones are ringing off the hook because they need the United States of America. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=725.64s)]
*  Not just our economy and our market, but they need us to continue providing peace around [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=729.96s)]
*  this world. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  And they know that they are indebted to us for the stability that we have provided in [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  their own countries for decades. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=739.76s)]
*  And the president has made that very clear. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=741.96s)]
*  When you talk about these letters and you talk about kind of the 90 deals in 90 days, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=744.12s)]
*  or at least the president did back in April, so far that we've seen three and they're not [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  concrete deals the way that we're used to seeing trade deals. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=755.48s)]
*  So that's one of their frameworks. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=758.72s)]
*  The president has a reputation, self-described dealmaker. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=760.12s)]
*  So why haven't we seen the kind of deals that he promised in the last 90 days? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=765.36s)]
*  Again, he didn't promise this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=770.74s)]
*  And when we send out the hundred letters to these countries, that will set their tariff [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=773.44s)]
*  rate. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=778.16s)]
*  So we're going to have a hundred done in the next few days. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=779.16s)]
*  That's not a deal. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=783.12s)]
*  That's a threat. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=784.84s)]
*  No, that's the level. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=785.84s)]
*  That's the deal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=788.12s)]
*  If you want to trade with the United States, this is... [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=789.12s)]
*  But that's not a negotiation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  That's just a declaration. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=793.44s)]
*  Well, many of these countries never even contacted us. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=794.44s)]
*  So there you have it, folks. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=798.5200000000001s)]
*  We'll keep you posted every step of the way. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUdcwRHuAw&t=799.5200000000001s)]
