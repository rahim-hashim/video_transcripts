# Trump gets SHREDDED by PISSED OFF Dem Senator
**MeidasTouch:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk)
*  I'm joined by California Senator Adam Schiff. Senator, we're about 156 days into this Trump regime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=0.0s)]
*  I just wanted to get your reaction. You and I haven't spoken in a while to all the mayhem and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=6.88s)]
*  chaos that he's causing. Well, this is far worse, I think, than any of us could have expected. And [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=11.6s)]
*  we expected this administration would be bad. I think we expected that they would have learned [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=18.16s)]
*  from the first administration. And that is not had any one of any independence or stature or [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=23.44s)]
*  gravitas in the cabinet or elsewhere that would stand up to him. And as a result, his enablers [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=29.36s)]
*  around him are enabling him to do all kinds of terrible things to people, to routinely violate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=36.96s)]
*  the law, to violate court orders, to militarize law enforcement, to, over the objections of our [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=42.72s)]
*  governor in California, federalize the National Guard, to create just chaos. And he may thrive [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=50.72s)]
*  on that, but the American people don't. And we've got a long time ahead of us. And the challenge [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=59.2s)]
*  will be keeping our democracy together until he finally leaves office. Talk about this disastrous [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=66.16s)]
*  budget bill. It was a disaster in the House. It seems that the Senate Finance Committee and the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=73.76s)]
*  MAGA Republicans in the Senate have made it worse. If that's even possible, tell us the status, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=79.28s)]
*  what's happening, what are you and Democrats doing to fight back? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=85.52s)]
*  Well, this is just an awful bill that will do grave harm. It will kick millions of people off [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=89.36s)]
*  their health care. It will literally take food from hungry people by cutting the SNAP program [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=94.8s)]
*  dramatically. For all their promises that this bill was going to help working families or average [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=101.28s)]
*  Americans, the only people really benefiting here are the very wealthy, because they're going to take [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=106.24s)]
*  the so-called savings from taking food away from hungry people and from closing hospitals [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=111.84s)]
*  and closing clinics and depriving people of access to health care. They're going to take [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=117.28s)]
*  those resources and put it into tax cuts for really wealthy people. And even then, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=121.28s)]
*  it won't pay for the magnitude of tax cuts they want for really rich people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  So they're going to borrow money from our kids and grandkids to pay for the tax cuts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=132.0s)]
*  That is just so horribly irresponsible. I completely understand why young people feel alienated from [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=137.12s)]
*  government, feel betrayed by the generations that went on before. My parents' generation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=145.36s)]
*  my father's generation, that was part of the greatest generation. They fought a world war, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  that generation, to protect our freedom, to make this prosperity, the country, seem possible. Now [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=156.16s)]
*  this generation wants to basically borrow from their kids and grandkids to give themselves a tax [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=164.0s)]
*  cut. That is such a betrayal. You look at the polling on this disastrous budget bill, and it is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  very low. Whether you're looking at a Fox poll or a Quinnipiac poll or an AP, it doesn't matter. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  This thing's either in the 20s or the low 30s, very low. But it seems that Donald Trump and the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  MAGA Republicans just think that they get to call it big, beautiful bill. He waves his hands, he does [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=194.0s)]
*  the lie. They roll out the propaganda machine, and they jam this down the throats of the American [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  people. They do another scam. And then when it hurts people, they do what they usually do, blame [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=206.24s)]
*  it on somebody else, find a scapegoat, rinse and repeat. How do we stop this cycle of destruction [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=211.68s)]
*  by Trump and MAGA and this propaganda machine that hoisted up? We make them own it. Every day [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=217.68s)]
*  we make them own it. And I think that is working. Number one, we're getting out the message about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=223.36s)]
*  just how awful this bill is and who the real beneficiaries are. They're pushing out a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=228.8s)]
*  counter narrative, but it is not gaining any traction because it's simply not true. And I [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=233.84s)]
*  think we're being effective in how we're communicating about this bill to the point where [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=238.8s)]
*  Republican senators during, I think, their last weekly meeting, their lunch meeting, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=244.0s)]
*  several rose up and talked about just what harm this is going to do, not to their constituents. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  That was only incidental. What harm is it going to do to them? The fact that they may lose the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=256.16s)]
*  House, that they may lose the Senate because the effect is going to be kicking millions of people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=260.88s)]
*  off of healthcare. So yes, you're right. When they do this, if they do this, then they will try to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=265.84s)]
*  run away from it. They'll blame Biden or some other stuff because the buck always falls with [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=273.2s)]
*  someone else with them. But there will be no hiding the responsibility for this. And that's why [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  staying on this message, being focused, drumming it in what a giveaway this is to really wealthy [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=284.88s)]
*  people and what theft it is away from people's healthcare. They promised, Trump promised, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=294.8s)]
*  they weren't going to raid Medicaid. They're raiding Medicaid. And what's more, because this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=300.48s)]
*  isn't paid for, there are going to be automatic cuts to Medicare. So they're going to break that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=306.48s)]
*  promise too. But we're going to stay focused on this. We expect to have probably at the end of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=311.52s)]
*  this week, one of those Votoramas where we're going to offer every amendment that will put [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=317.68s)]
*  them on the record through morning, noon and night and hold that floor as long as we can under the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=323.76s)]
*  Senate rules and make the case. Then we're going to hit the airwaves and continue to hit the airwaves [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  and let people know how they're being betrayed by this big ugly bill. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=335.12s)]
*  We see Trump cabinet officials, I would say testifying, but what it appears to me they're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=339.76s)]
*  doing is either showing up without testimony to give or I believe lying. Some may call that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=346.48s)]
*  perjury, although that's a legal definition. They show up in front of the Senate committees. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=352.88s)]
*  They're unprepared. They have these weird PowerPoint presentations that don't actually [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=358.4s)]
*  provide the data. They either say they don't know or they're outright lying. What have you made [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=363.12s)]
*  of, you know, it would be a comedy if it wasn't actually so dangerous to see one by one, these [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=368.96s)]
*  stooges show up unqualified, inexperienced and frankly lying. You see it firsthand. So what's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=374.88s)]
*  your take on it, Senator? Well, I think you're absolutely right. There is really no shame. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=380.96s)]
*  The master of shamelessness is of course Donald Trump, who, you know, 15 times an hour says things [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  are just provably patently false, but we've come to expect that from him. We're going to have to, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=392.0s)]
*  I guess, come to expect that for a lot of Republicans in Congress, they operate in very much the same [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  fashion. They say up is down and left is right and they just make stuff up and they figure as long [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=403.68s)]
*  as they keep repeating it, people will buy it. I mean, after all, there are a lot of people that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=411.76s)]
*  have bought the false narrative that January 6th was an ordinary tourist day. And I think their [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=416.24s)]
*  reasoning is, hey, if you can make people believe they can't believe their lying eyes, they can't [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=421.92s)]
*  believe what they all saw or witnessed, then maybe we can make them believe that this big ugly bill [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=426.64s)]
*  is somehow good for them. But when people's hospital down the road closes, it won't matter [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=432.48s)]
*  whether they're on Medicaid or not, their hospital is going to close because those Medicaid dollars [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=439.04s)]
*  aren't going to come to that hospital. When their clinic closes, you know, they're not going to be [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  able to try to say, hey, the hospital is really open. You just can't see it. They will not run to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=448.72s)]
*  the ribbon cutting like they did after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and build back [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=456.0s)]
*  better the infrastructure bill. When they race to ribbon cuttings that were made possible by a bill, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=462.08s)]
*  they voted against, but they will hide when it comes to the closures from their own bill. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=468.56s)]
*  And we nonetheless will make them own it. Donald Trump's personal attorney who became a top [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  DOJ official who has now been nominated by Trump to be one of the highest judges in our land, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=483.84s)]
*  a Third Circuit Court of Appeals judge appeared before the Senate today. And I think my [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=490.96s)]
*  characterization of both the non-answers, equivocating and lying, all happened in once. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=496.4s)]
*  On very serious issues, our audience will recall that there was a whistleblower letter from another [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=501.36s)]
*  top federal prosecutor saying Emile Bové engaged in all of this unlawful conduct and then fired the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=506.48s)]
*  whistleblower for calling out the conduct, including Emile Bové saying, do not listen to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=512.72s)]
*  federal judges. F them. F the federal judges. Let me show this exchange that you had with Emile Bové [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=518.8s)]
*  at this confirmation hearing and let me get your take on everything. Let's play this clip. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=525.76s)]
*  Let's turn to the meeting that Mr. Rivani, the whistleblower, has written an extensive [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=530.4799999999999s)]
*  complaint about. The hearing started with the chairman reading a social media post by [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=535.92s)]
*  the deputy attorney general Blanche who is present today but not under oath nor is that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=543.04s)]
*  social media post under oath. So let me ask you, since you are under oath, in the complaint it says [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=548.72s)]
*  Bové stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts, fuck you, and ignoring any such court [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  order. Did you say anything of that kind in the meeting? Senator, I have no recollection of saying [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=562.4s)]
*  anything of that kind. To the extent I usually. Wouldn't you recall, Mr. Bové, if you said or [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=569.76s)]
*  suggested during a meeting with justice department lawyers that maybe they should consider telling [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=574.8s)]
*  the court, fuck you, it seems to me that would be something you'd remember unless that's the kind [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=579.3599999999999s)]
*  of thing you say frequently. Well, I've certainly said things encouraging litigators at the department [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=583.92s)]
*  to fight hard for valid positions that we have to take in defense of our clients. And if you frequently suggested that they say, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  fuck you, and ignore court orders, is that also something you frequently do such you might not [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=597.28s)]
*  remember doing it on this occasion? No, and as I explained, I have never directed. So did you or did you not [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=602.08s)]
*  make those comments during that meeting? Which comments, Senator? You really need me to repeat it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  Did you suggest, as Mr. Rouveni wrote, that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=614.96s)]
*  fuck you, and ignore any such court order? I did not suggest that there would be any need to consider [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  ignoring court orders. At the point of that meeting, there were no court orders to discuss. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, did you suggest telling the courts, fuck you, in any manner? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't recall. You just don't remember that? I don't recall. Senator, your reaction to that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=637.84s)]
*  interaction today? He's simply not credible. And you have credible people who were in that meeting [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  making that allegation, including this whistleblower who was promoted, was given a number of accolades [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=652.16s)]
*  by the Justice Department during Democratic administrations, during Republican administrations. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=658.88s)]
*  He was promoted by the Trump administration. Mr. Beauvais would have us believe that there's just [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=663.6s)]
*  some coincidence, some grand coincidence, that prosecutor after prosecutor after prosecutor [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  has had to quit because they wouldn't follow unethical orders by Emile Beauvais, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=677.68s)]
*  or were fired because they wouldn't do unethical things, or in this case were fired for making a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  truthful representation to the court that they had wrongly deported, rendered someone to a maximum [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=690.4s)]
*  security prison outside the court, outside the country. So Mr. Beauvais would have us believe [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=696.88s)]
*  that all those people are just making this stuff up, including the judge that presided over the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=701.76s)]
*  Eric Adams case, who basically said, in contrast again to Emile Beauvais' testimony today, that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=706.96s)]
*  everything smacked him as a bargain. It's essentially a quid pro quo that they would dismiss [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  that case against the mayor of New York in exchange for the mayor's help on the president's [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=721.76s)]
*  immigration policy. So everybody apparently has got it wrong except Emile Beauvais. I just [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=726.8s)]
*  don't believe him. I don't think anyone believes him. And he made it abundantly clear today why [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  no one should believe him. Finally, Senator, in these dark times with all of the distractions and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=738.88s)]
*  waking up with another Trump post, is this going to be a war? Is he going to send troops into LA? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=746.64s)]
*  There's a lot going on. But do you see signs of hope in this chaos and mayhem? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=752.64s)]
*  I really do. You see signs of hope every day because you have people like the whistleblower [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=758.88s)]
*  who filed that complaint and brought to the public attention the improper moral and unlawful conduct [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=764.72s)]
*  of Emile Beauvais. You have others that are quitting because they won't engage in unethical [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=771.76s)]
*  conduct. You have Americans taking to the streets in record numbers by the millions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=777.12s)]
*  to express their views. You see voters in some of the early elections like in Wisconsin [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=782.48s)]
*  demonstrating their dissatisfaction with what this regime is doing. So there are reasons every day [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=789.12s)]
*  a university finally stands up to Trump or a law firm finally stands up to Trump. You see people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  finding their voice, finding their courage. And that ought to give us the confidence to know we [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=803.36s)]
*  will get through this. We've been through other difficult times in our history. This too shall [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=808.96s)]
*  pass. Sometimes we're going to have to take it one day at a time, but we're going to get through this, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=813.84s)]
*  but it's going to require all of us. Senator Adam Schiff, thanks for joining us as always. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzK88hR_Vqk&t=819.36s)]
