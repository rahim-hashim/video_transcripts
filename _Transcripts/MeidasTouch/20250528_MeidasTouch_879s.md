# MAGA Mike gets STABBED IN THE BACK by THE GOP
**MeidasTouch:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA)
*  Maga Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House, is getting clowned on. He just got [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=0.0s)]
*  devastating news as more Mago Republican senators in the Senate are saying no way, no how are they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  supporting the big, disastrous bill that Maga Mike and Donald Trump want to push forward. But get [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=13.68s)]
*  this, you know who else is also tag-teaming Maga Mike and Donald Trump and telling them no way, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=19.92s)]
*  no how with this budget bill? Elon Musk and Ron DeSantis. By the way, you also have the chair [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=27.68s)]
*  of the Republican National Committee, a guy named Michael Watley, saying that this thing is no bueno [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=36.08s)]
*  as well. Let me take a look as Maga Mike gets his worst nightmare smacked down. What the hell are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=43.92s)]
*  you going to do, Maga Mike Johnson? So here we have Mago Republican Senator Rick Scott, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=50.72s)]
*  who was involved in the biggest Medicaid and Medicare fraud in the history of the United [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=58.32s)]
*  States. That's how he got his money after pleading the fifth dozens and dozens of times in a case [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=63.6s)]
*  against his company. But here he says, uh-uh, he ain't voting on the budget bill. Watch Maga [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=69.28s)]
*  Republican Senator Rick Scott play this clip. So Senator, would you say without any changes [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=76.16s)]
*  at its current composition, would you vote no? Oh, absolutely. I'd vote no. This bill doesn't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=82.0s)]
*  have it. If they brought it to the floor right now, there's not a chance it'll get the 51 votes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=88.08s)]
*  it needs. Now here is leaked audio from the RNC chair saying that the Republicans voted for the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=95.36s)]
*  largest tax increase in American history with Trump's budget bill. This came from Factpost [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=102.08s)]
*  that clipped it and Hakimian who noted it. Play this clip. What we saw was the largest tax increase [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=109.44s)]
*  in the American history that the Republicans had voted for. Every single Democrat voted against it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=115.6s)]
*  But it all- Here we've got Elon Musk saying, uh-uh, he's not in support of this. Play this clip. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=121.84s)]
*  So, you know, I was like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=128.88s)]
*  the budget deficit, not just decrease it. And I don't know if it reminds the work that the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=136.88s)]
*  Doge team is doing. I actually thought that when this big, beautiful bill came along, I mean, like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=140.8s)]
*  everything he's done on Doge gets wiped out in the first year. I think, I think a bill can be, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=145.6s)]
*  can be, can be big or it can be beautiful. But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=151.28s)]
*  This was a speech from Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, saying that this is a bad bill that the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=158.16s)]
*  Republicans in the house and in Congress in general have betrayed the American people. Play this clip. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  Yet we have a Republican Congress and to this day, we're in the, the end of May, past Memorial Day, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=172.72s)]
*  and not one cent in Doge cuts have been implemented by the Congress. That's one of the reasons why we [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  need a balanced budget amendment to the U S constitution. It's another reason why we need [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=187.36s)]
*  term limits for members of Congress. But I think what you've seen with how, and I, I kind of said [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=198.8s)]
*  this early on that Doge and Elon were on a collision course with the swamp. And the question is, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=210.4s)]
*  and I don't think there's any question that Doge fought the swamp and so far the swamp has won. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=217.84s)]
*  And that's just unfortunate, but I don't think you can look at this any other way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=224.56s)]
*  More from MAGA Republican Senator Rick Scott. Cause our audience is like, wait a second, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=228.4s)]
*  I thought it passed the house. Are you saying that the Senate can change it? And then there's a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=232.56s)]
*  reconciliation between the house and the Senate? Is that correct? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, we'll change it. We'll have our own bill and what'll happen is it'll go back [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=240.08s)]
*  through a conference or I'll just go back to the house and they'll pass our bill. But I, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=244.8s)]
*  I believe we're going to dramatically reduce mandatory spending to get this budget balanced [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=249.12s)]
*  in a short period of time, which is what we have to do. Here's Rick Scott again, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  right here, play this clip. The house bill cuts the spending by less than 2% [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  over the next 10 years. It doesn't balance a budget. This isn't even close to balancing the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=262.24s)]
*  budget. So there's a whole bunch of us. We are going to fight like hell to balance this budget. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=267.04s)]
*  Now we're seeing fractures even among MAGA Republicans in the house of representatives [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  as well who voted for this thing. For example, you've got a MAGA Republican Congress member [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  named Tom Tiffany from Wisconsin's seventh, who says he wants to see more cuts to Medicaid. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=287.28s)]
*  Play this clip. Are you concerned at all that the Senate would look to cut Medicaid even more [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=294.88s)]
*  in a quest to find more savings? I think there's some ways in which they can find more savings. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=299.44s)]
*  And I think over time, it's going to be important to do that. Because if we're going to protect and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  save that program for who it's meant to be, which is the vulnerable, it's the, you know, it's, it's, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  it's someone that has a disability, pregnant women, poor people, if we're going to protect that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=318.0s)]
*  program for who it was meant for, there are more reforms that can be made. Okay, so here's the deal. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  I love animals, always have, but the second I step into a house with a cat, instant allergy [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=328.88s)]
*  meltdown. It's like my body staging a protest, itchy eyes, runny nose, the whole nightmare. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=333.2s)]
*  I used to just avoid cats altogether until I discovered Packagen. This podcast is sponsored [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=337.84s)]
*  by Packagen. And if you or someone in your home is allergic to cats, listen up. Nearly one in five [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=343.12s)]
*  people have cat allergies and most allergy solutions just mask symptoms. Packagen's cat [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=348.8s)]
*  allergen neutralizing spray, it goes straight to the source, the allergens floating around your [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=354.56s)]
*  home and actually breaks them down so you can live and breathe in peace. Turns out it's not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=359.04s)]
*  the cat fur, it's their saliva. When cats groom, they basically coat themselves in allergens. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=364.24s)]
*  Packagen uses this brilliant protein called whisker block to neutralize those allergens [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=369.12s)]
*  safely without any harsh chemicals. Just spray it every few days and that's it. 97% of Packagen [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=374.32s)]
*  customers say they feel real relief. I used it last time my friend brought his cat over. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=381.04s)]
*  No allergens meant no more sneezing, just good vibes. And this isn't some gimmick, it's engineered [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  by scientists from Harvard and Princeton. Packagen is allergist recommended, vet approved, and PhD [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  engineered. Your pets aren't just pets, they're family. So get the relief you need with Packagen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=398.16s)]

*  Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, MAGA Republican saying no way is he supporting this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=432.32s)]
*  President Trump has suggested that the debt is not really top of mind of his concerns. He wants [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=437.6s)]
*  Republicans to fall in line. He wants Republicans to pass the bill. You told CNN quote, somebody's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=441.76s)]
*  got to be the dad that says, I know y'all want to go to Disney World, but we can't afford it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=447.12s)]
*  I guess I'm going to be that guy unquote. So how determined are you to be that guy if it actually [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=452.16s)]
*  means telling President Trump you are going to vote against the bill and you're going to try to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=457.92s)]
*  get other Republican senators to join you unless there are major, major changes? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=462.88s)]
*  Well, in 2010, I sprang out of the Tea Party movement and as I did praise my, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=470.32s)]
*  I would shout, this is a fight for freedom. We are mortgaging our children's future. It's wrong, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=474.72s)]
*  it's immoral, it has to stop. I haven't changed. My campaign promise in 2010 and every campaign [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  after that was to stop mortgaging our children's future. It's immoral, it's wrong, it has to stop. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=485.36s)]
*  And so he may not be worried about that. I am extremely worried about that. That is my primary [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=491.2s)]
*  goal running for Congress. This is our moment. We've witnessed an unprecedented level of increased [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  spending, 58% since 2019, other than World War II. This is our only chance to reset that to a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending. And again, I think you can do it and the spending [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=512.16s)]
*  that we would eliminate, people wouldn't even notice, but you have to do the work, which takes time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=516.8s)]
*  Maggots Republican Senator Rand Paul saying he ain't supporting this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=521.04s)]
*  ...spending. Somebody has to stand up and yell, the emperor has no clothes, and everybody's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=524.8s)]
*  falling in lockstep on this, pass the big beautiful bill, don't question anything. Well, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=531.12s)]
*  conservatives do need to stand up and have their voice heard. This is a problem we've been facing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=536.4s)]
*  for decades now. And if we don't stand up on it, I really fear the direction the country is going. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=542.16s)]
*  The Senator, or excuse me, the speaker is- And here he explains one of the reasons why he [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=547.52s)]
*  says it's going to add trillions to the deficit. And he goes, just look, the budget bill itself [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=551.12s)]
*  calls for raising the debt ceiling by 4 trillion over the next two years. They're going to run [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=557.52s)]
*  $2 trillion deficits per year. I think it's going to be more. Play this clip. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=562.96s)]
*  Biden spending levels. When March, every Republican, virtually every Republican other than me, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=567.44s)]
*  voted to continue the Biden spending levels, which are going to give us a $2.2 trillion deficit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, if you increase the debt ceiling, $4 to $5 trillion, that means they're planning on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=578.08s)]
*  $2 trillion this year and more than $2 trillion next year. That's just not conservative. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  So I've told them if they strip out the debt ceiling, I'll consider even with the imperfections [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=587.12s)]
*  voting for the rest of the bill, but I can't vote to raise the debt ceiling 5 trillion. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=592.08s)]
*  There's got to be someone left in Washington who thinks debt is wrong and deficits are wrong and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=595.6s)]
*  wants to go in the other direction. The idea that we're going to explode deficits and the projections [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=600.32s)]
*  are now looking at over $3 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years, I think is just, you know, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=605.44s)]
*  not a serious proposal. So you know the- [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=610.96s)]
*  You know who's also against the budget bill in its current form? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=613.44s)]
*  MAGA Republican Senator Josh Hawley played this clip. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=617.2s)]
*  So if this bill comes over from the House to the Senate and you have to vote on it, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  are you know if this bill does not change? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not going to support this bill from the House in this form. I think that's clear. It's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=628.08s)]
*  got to change before it can pass the Senate. And I continue to stand by my line in the sand, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=632.24s)]
*  which is no Medicaid benefit cuts. Listen, if you want to do work requirements, I'm all for that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=637.12s)]
*  I bet every Republican and I bet most Americans would agree with that. But we're not talking here [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  about just work requirements. The House goes much, much, much further than that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=645.68s)]
*  This is real Medicaid benefit cuts. I can't support that. No Republican should support that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=649.68s)]
*  We're the party of the working class, Manu. We need to act like it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=653.92s)]
*  MAGA Republican Senator Kevin Kramer played the clip. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=656.8s)]
*  It's rich coming from a freedom practice. It's supposed to be fiscal conservatives and end up [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  with not that conservative to elect us. What we're going to do is we're going to pass a bill [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=666.56s)]
*  that can get 50 votes and whatever other numbers come along with that, the magic number is 50. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=673.2s)]
*  In other words, both of them actually passed the bill. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=680.32s)]
*  MAGA Republican Senator Lindsey Graham played the clip. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=684.24s)]
*  Some of the Freedom Caucus members are warning you guys not to water down any of their cuts. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=689.76s)]
*  What do you say to them? You had your chance. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=694.32s)]
*  Some of these cuts are not real. We're talking about over a decade, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=697.36s)]
*  if you do a trade and a half, that's like a percent and a half. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=705.12s)]
*  So let's don't get higher on a horse here that we've somehow [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=710.0s)]
*  made some major advancement of reducing spending because we did. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that MAGA Mike Johnson has done here as well [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=718.48s)]
*  is he's highlighted the cruelty of the GOP platform. He's showing that they want to cut [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=723.52s)]
*  food assistance, SNAP, supplemental nutrition assistance program, cut rental assistance programs [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=730.8s)]
*  to people. If you're making between zero and 50,000 or 51,000, you literally just on day one, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=738.8s)]
*  $1,000 gets taken from you and gets given to people who make more than $4.3 million, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=746.56s)]
*  who will be saving an extra $370,000. The billionaires are going to get literally [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  trillions of dollars in tax cuts right here and Medicaid and Medicare is cut. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=758.4799999999999s)]
*  But here's what MAGA Mike Johnson had to say about cutting SNAP [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=763.3599999999999s)]
*  in his own congressional district. Here, playing this clip. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  This very clear, we are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=776.64s)]
*  elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics in 2024, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=780.88s)]
*  over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous. I mean, that's a number that everyone [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=786.4s)]
*  acknowledges is real. It may be much higher than that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=792.8s)]
*  Louisiana is like the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=795.04s)]
*  Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it. The states are not properly administering this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=798.8s)]
*  because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=804.64s)]
*  just a modest state sharing component so that they'll pay attention to that so that we can [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=807.84s)]
*  reduce fraud. Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=812.16s)]
*  common sense, Margaret. It's good government and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=817.28s)]
*  to that. Well, Senator Hall. There you have it. I've got the receipts. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=821.28s)]
*  We're going to see. Here's my prediction. We had, they're not going to pass anything. We're [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=826.56s)]
*  going to head right up to an issue where they got to raise the debt ceiling. And we're going [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=832.64s)]
*  to have an issue of a potential government shutdown. Everybody's going to scramble and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=838.56s)]
*  panic. And that's just how the GOP does business. Like Trump, the bankruptor, the felon, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLIMWJbscA&t=843.52s)]
