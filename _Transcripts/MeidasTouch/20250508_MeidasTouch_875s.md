# Trump gets INSTANT KARMA as his PLANS CRASH
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM)
*  Weak, pathetic, vile, cruel, all of these things describe that piece of trash in the Oval Office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=0.0s)]
*  named Donald Trump who increasingly looks so utterly pathetic to the international community. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=7.98s)]
*  We know here in the United States that his approval is plummeting, and I think the world [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=14.8s)]
*  is seeing what a pathetic and weak fool he is. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=20.06s)]
*  This meme right here is kind of defining the Trump regime right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=22.7s)]
*  It's Donald Trump in AI form wagging his finger at a little girl saying, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=27.94s)]
*  you will own one doll and one pencil and you will be happy little girl and you're going [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=33.22s)]
*  to pay more money for it because the Trump regime's central planners say that's what [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=38.42s)]
*  little girls get. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=43.58s)]
*  Stop asking for all of these dolls. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=45.14s)]
*  That's actually something that Donald Trump's been repeating over and over again as his [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=47.56s)]
*  presidency continues to plummet and spiral out of control. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  Now, as Donald Trump is doing that, let's take a look at what else he's doing as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=57.06s)]
*  Of course, yesterday he continued to push his Trump meme coins, enriching himself as [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=61.46s)]
*  he's still done no deals in the trade war against the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=68.22s)]
*  One of the things we've learned is that the Trump family net worth though, while Donald [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump's wagging his fingers at little girls saying you can only own one pencil and one doll, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=78.86s)]
*  and while mortgage rates are soaring and housing is less affordable and inflation is on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=84.46s)]
*  rise, the new Goldman Sachs report shows inflation's coming back and it's coming back bad, folks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=89.74s)]
*  Donald Trump's family's net worth has increased by $2.9 billion thanks to crypto investments, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=95.66s)]
*  according to new reports. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=102.94s)]
*  Also, we know that the Abu Dhabi fund is going to be using Trump crypto in billions of dollars [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=104.46s)]
*  worth of transactions, shifting transaction fees right into Donald Trump and his kids' [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=111.06s)]
*  pocket as Donald Trump then continues to do deals with Qatar for Trump resorts, deals [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=116.78s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia for Trump resorts in Oman, and Don Jr. continues with his club called [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=122.3s)]
*  the Executive Branch, which he's selling memberships for for $500,000 a membership. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that went down yesterday that we got to talk about as well is Donald [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=136.38s)]
*  Trump firing his surgeon general via a social media post. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=141.26s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's prior surgeon general was a surgeon general named Dr. Nashiwat, and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=146.82s)]
*  Laura Loomer wanted that doctor fired. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=154.06s)]
*  So then Donald Trump hired like a social media, like a junk science, fake science kind of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=157.18s)]
*  influencer person by the name of Casey Means, who I don't even think is a licensed doctor [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  to be the surgeon general. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=171.18s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump announced it via a social media post. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=172.5s)]
*  Donald Trump goes, I am pleased to announce that Dr. Casey Means will be nominated as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=177.82s)]
*  our next surgeon general of the United States of America. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=182.16s)]
*  Casey has impeccable MAHA credentials, MAHA credentials, and will work closely with our [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=185.42s)]
*  wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, Andrea Love, PhD, explains Casey Means is a grifter who dropped out of her ENT residency [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=194.94s)]
*  to start a company selling glucose monitors and health all to non-diabetics. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  She doesn't know basic science yet claims she's a metabolism expert. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=209.46s)]
*  Incomplete ENT residency does not an expert make. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  But of course, she's now up for surgeon general. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  Pat Dennis says, here's a list of things our new surgeon general, Casey Means, did to find [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=220.58s)]
*  love at age 35 per her newsletter. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=226.06s)]
*  Shrine, full moon ceremonies, she talked to trees, and then she did mushrooms. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  Even Donald Trump's close advisor, Laura Loomer, says, what are you doing? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=235.28s)]
*  Aren't surgeon generals supposed to be top doctors, not people who appear not to even [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=240.4s)]
*  have their licenses? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=246.34s)]
*  We'll report more on this today, but that's Donald Trump's surgeon general for you folks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=248.96s)]
*  Also, Donald Trump tends to announce today, according to the New York Times, that he's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=253.76s)]
*  going to do some sort of deal with the United Kingdom, but it seems to be one of those fake [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=258.56s)]
*  deals to manipulate the market again because Donald Trump realized that systemically our [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=263.32s)]
*  market, our actual economy right now is breaking. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=268.76s)]
*  But what he saw with his trade war against the world is that he can move the market and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=272.32s)]
*  manipulate it, especially for his rich oligarch friends who get inside tips or learn about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=276.6s)]
*  it through private meetings. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=281.44s)]
*  And he can do that by tweeting and posting about things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  But when you actually look at what this UK supposed deal is going to be, the deal won't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  even get rid of the 10 percent tariffs on the UK. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=292.04s)]
*  It looks like there will be a reduction in tariffs on British cars in exchange for the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=295.68s)]
*  UK lowering taxes on digital services like Google. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=299.8s)]
*  So it's not a deal. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=303.88s)]
*  Is this one of those sub deals that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is talking about? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  As Spencer Akimian says, every six hours, Donald Trump's going to come back with a new [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=310.92s)]
*  massive trade deal that ends up being absolutely nothing just to pump the markets for a few [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  hours. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=321.76s)]
*  Here is Donald Trump yesterday during that bizarre press conference that we covered here [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=322.76s)]
*  in the Midas Touch Network where he was asked, are you willing to pull back your tariffs [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=327.44s)]
*  to get China to the negotiating table? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=333.2s)]
*  Remember, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he's going to Switzerland to speak with [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=336.12s)]
*  China's trade representatives. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=340.64s)]
*  So the reporter asks, are you going to pull back any of these tariffs? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=342.68s)]
*  Trump sabotages Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's talks with China before they even begin. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=346.24s)]
*  Trump says no. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=351.28s)]
*  Here, play this clip right here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=352.28s)]
*  In order to have substantive negotiations, you have to bring down your 145 percent tariffs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=353.28s)]
*  Are you open to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=362.11999999999995s)]
*  A reporter then follows up with Donald Trump and says China said that the US initiated [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  the trade talks this week. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  What do you say about that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  To which Donald Trump said, they're wrong, they're lying. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=370.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, you pretty much have the track record of lying right here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=374.2s)]
*  Let's play that clip. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  We will, but we haven't made that decision yet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=378.48s)]
*  Mr. President, China said the US initiated the trade talks this week and that its position [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  hasn't changed. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you still confident you can reach a deal with China? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  They said we initiated? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=390.76s)]
*  Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=392.56s)]
*  OK, I do think that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's saying right there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  What is Xi Jinping saying? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=400.32s)]
*  Xi Jinping is taking a trip to Russia where he is going to be in Moscow meeting with Vladimir [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  Putin. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you see, by the way, both of them giving Donald Trump the middle finger right here? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  It is a move showing that they think Donald Trump is utterly weak and pathetic. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=414.96s)]
*  And trust me, our NATO allies who now see Donald Trump as weak and pathetic know exactly [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=419.52s)]
*  what this meeting between Putin and Xi Jinping is about. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=424.76s)]
*  And ahead of this meeting, China's Xi Jinping likens US hegemony to fascist forces ahead [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=429.44s)]
*  of this meeting. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=436.48s)]
*  Xi Jinping has drawn a parallel between the modern-day US hegemony and the arrogant fascist [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=437.48s)]
*  forces of 80 years ago ahead of Thursday's Moscow summit with Vladimir Putin and Second [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=443.28s)]
*  World War Victory Day celebrations. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=449.32s)]
*  The Chinese and Russian president are using the visit to signal the strength of their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=451.76s)]
*  alliance against the US-led international order as Donald Trump unleashes tariffs on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=455.96s)]
*  Beijing and tries to push Moscow towards a peace deal. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that's what Donald Trump's actually doing there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=464.88s)]
*  The just forces, this is the quote from Xi, the just forces of the world, including China [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=467.28s)]
*  and the Soviet Union, fought bravely and defeated the arrogant fascist forces side by side, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=472.12s)]
*  Xi wrote in an article published in Russian and Chinese media before his arrival in Moscow [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  on Wednesday. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=481.96s)]
*  He added, 80 years later, unilateralism, hegemony, and bullying are extremely harmful. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=482.96s)]
*  Humanity is once again at a crossroads. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=489.84s)]
*  Moscow struck a similar note in the run-up to Thursday's summit, the first between Putin [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  and Xi since Trump took office in January. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=497.64s)]
*  The just forces of the world, including China and the Soviet Union, fought bravely side [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=500.4s)]
*  by side to defeat the arrogant fascist forces, Xi wrote in the article. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=504.96s)]
*  And again, analogizing it once again to what's going on right now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=512.12s)]
*  Want to share this with you though, because let me bring you some other just objective [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=518.12s)]
*  data. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=522.44s)]
*  I want to share with you what's going on in the Seattle ports. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=523.44s)]
*  So first I want to show you the guy who's leading the Seattle ports right now so you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=526.88s)]
*  can see what he's saying about the ships coming in. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  Let's play this clip first. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=533.96s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=534.96s)]
*  Of America. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=535.96s)]
*  So it's great to have you here tonight, sir. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=536.96s)]
*  The tariffs so far, I wonder for you directly, what is the impact that you're seeing? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=538.32s)]
*  How could you sum up how much your job has changed because of the policies coming out [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  of the White House tonight? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Caitlin. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I can see it right over my shoulder here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=551.88s)]
*  I'm looking out at the Port of Seattle right now and we currently have no container ships [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=553.48s)]
*  at birth. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=558.12s)]
*  And that happens every once in a while in normal times, but it is pretty rare. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=559.12s)]
*  And so to see it tonight is I think a stark reminder that the impacts of the tariffs have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  real implications. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  It means that we don't have longshore workers on the dock right now unloading merchandise. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't have trains taking that merchandise to inland ports and all the way across the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=573.4s)]
*  country to places like Des Moines, Iowa and Chicago, Illinois. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=579.04s)]
*  And that's hundreds of jobs right here in our region and across the country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=583.28s)]
*  You have none at your port right now? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=587.8s)]
*  We currently do not have any container ships at port right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=594.76s)]
*  And that's because just nothing is being shipped over? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=596.88s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty remarkable. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=600.12s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=601.6s)]
*  It's pretty unusual. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=603.72s)]
*  We do anticipate, I was looking at our schedule, we anticipate about 25 vessel calls between [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=604.88s)]
*  here and the port of Tacoma over the next seven days. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=609.72s)]
*  And keep in mind, we're not just importing from Asia or just China. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=613.0s)]
*  We do have activity from all over the world, largely the Pacific Rim, but we are seeing [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=616.48s)]
*  a significant drop in container volume through our... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=621.52s)]
*  And now let me play for you the guy who's leading the ports in Los Angeles, in Long [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=625.04s)]
*  Beach over here, so you can see what he's saying right now. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=629.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  Just describe for us, let's take a beat, really frame it for us, how much volume has just [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=634.0s)]
*  dropped off in the last few weeks? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=638.48s)]
*  Yeah, about a third of the import volume, which means give or take about 50,000 20-foot [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=640.76s)]
*  equivalent units gone off the arrivals coming in next week. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=646.24s)]
*  From next week is when you expect to see this really hit? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=650.56s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=653.24s)]
*  The announcement's back on April 2nd, then on April 8th, a little bit of a change on [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=655.0s)]
*  everybody ex-China, Mexico, Canada, and those arrivals are coming at us this weekend. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=659.4s)]
*  We'll of course dedicate time to your port, but I'm just wondering how you're anticipating [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=665.12s)]
*  this rolls and ripples through the economy from here, how it hits trucking, when this [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=668.44s)]
*  turns up on the shelf, what's the distance, the time from when you see a drop off in volume [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=672.46s)]
*  and when we as consumers see the shortages? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=676.96s)]
*  So CEOs are telling me hit the pause button, right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=680.0s)]
*  I'm not going to import anymore at these kind of prices. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=683.04s)]
*  Let's wait and see. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=685.44s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be two hours, two days or two weeks till I get some clarity. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=686.08s)]
*  Then hiring off the table for right now, capital investment pause. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=692.12s)]
*  And the retailers are telling me that realistically, with even the 10 percent, I'm going to have [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=697.04s)]
*  to pass it on to the consumers. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=701.64s)]
*  So how much is this really coming from all over? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=703.0s)]
*  It's not just about China. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=705.56s)]
*  This is about really global trade coming to a standstill until there is a much greater [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=706.76s)]
*  degree of certainty and a much lower tariff rate than even the baseline that's been put out there. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I was last with you all, Lisa, I said global trade is going to slow, economies [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=716.76s)]
*  will follow, and that's exactly what we're seeing. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=720.68s)]
*  Back in November, so many of us were wringing our hands about four percent inflation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=722.8s)]
*  We've just added 10 percentage points to imports coming out of Southeast Asia for our port [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=726.72s)]
*  and these unbelievable numbers out of China. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=731.32s)]
*  Now, I bring you that objective data because while Donald Trump's out there lying, while [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=733.56s)]
*  you see Xi Jinping and Putin forming stronger alliances against the United States, so you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=739.32s)]
*  see what's going on there, while you see a war between Pakistan and India, India attacked [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, and that they're at war with each other right [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  now, a hot war, you see that Donald Trump has no clue what he's doing in all aspects, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=755.96s)]
*  economic, foreign policy, you name it, Trump has no clue. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=762.08s)]
*  So let me just show you one other objective data. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=765.2800000000001s)]
*  I want to show you hard data, the ports. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=767.76s)]
*  And now I'll just show you what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  yesterday here, play this clip. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=775.24s)]
*  What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we will see certainly [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=778.64s)]
*  the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=786.48s)]
*  And if that's what we do see, if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=790.2s)]
*  which we don't know, then we won't see further progress toward our goals. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=794.64s)]
*  We might see a delay in that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=800.48s)]
*  I think in our thinking, we would never do anything but keep achieving those goals, but [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=801.88s)]
*  we would, at least for the next, let's say, year, we would not be making progress toward [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=808.56s)]
*  those goals, again, if that's the way the tariffs shake out. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=813.72s)]
*  The thing is, we don't know that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=816.88s)]
*  There's so much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  So, I think that paints to you a clear picture of what's happening in the world right now. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=824.6s)]
*  And we'll keep you posted every step of the way here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  But the message over and over again is weakness, weakness, weakness of Donald Trump. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=833.64s)]
*  I don't know how you come away with something different. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=838.2s)]
*  And you think Donald Trump's going to do a deal with China after what China just said [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=840.88s)]
*  and what Trump's saying about China? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=844.64s)]
*  What did it? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=846.28s)]
*  The worst deal maker ever. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=847.28s)]
*  A destroyer, not a builder. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzcLuJp2QKM&t=849.24s)]
