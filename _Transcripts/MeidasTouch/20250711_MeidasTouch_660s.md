# SICKLY Trump gets INSTANT KARMA with AWFUL NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k)
*  Just stay the hell out, Donald. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=0.0s)]
*  Nobody wants you here in California or frankly anywhere. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Stay the hell out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  That's what was taking place in Camarillo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=15.32s)]
*  But Donald Trump sent his ice goons across California into Ventura County, Santa Barbara [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=18.72s)]
*  into Riverside County, into Fresno County across California, terrorizing farmers, the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=25.92s)]
*  people who grow our crops, the people who put food on our plate, the people who were [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=34.28s)]
*  there for us also during COVID when nobody was out there, the people who spend grueling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=39.08s)]
*  days doing the work that frankly no one else wants to do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=45.08s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's doing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=48.24s)]
*  Instead Donald Trump and his regime want to post photos like this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  This is real. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  This is a photo that they posted on their Instagram account, the official White House [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=53.8s)]
*  Instagram account. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  Superman, truth, justice, the American way and it's a Donald Trump AI version of himself [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  as Superman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=66.56s)]
*  Let's just take a look at the comments. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=67.56s)]
*  And a lot of these are from actual Trump supporters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=69.6s)]
*  Looks like he's flying away with the Epstein list. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=72.88s)]
*  Truth justice as a three time Trump voter. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm very disappointed with this entire administration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=77.92s)]
*  This is quite literally what we were taught about propaganda in middle school. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=81.28s)]
*  Lots of photos of Epstein, lots of photos of Trump and Epstein. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=85.88s)]
*  Cool poster, but where's the Epstein list? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=89.24s)]
*  How can people take this administration seriously? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=91.92s)]
*  What is this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=94.68s)]
*  Someone else wrote the most childish administration of all time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=95.8s)]
*  Someone else wrote, I'm still convinced a 15 year old boy with a chat GPT subscription [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  is in charge of this account. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=104.64s)]
*  It is humiliating, but let's show what Donald Trump really looks like. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=106.28s)]
*  Decrepit, sickly with all of that orange disgusting paint on his face. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=110.36s)]
*  This is what a sick deranged lunatic looks like. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=116.92s)]
*  Just look at his face right there as he goes and humiliates the United States to the rest [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=120.56s)]
*  of the world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=126.56s)]
*  He posted this letter on social media to our great ally Canada, which Donald Trump continues [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=127.72s)]
*  calls the 51st state and says that he wants to annex and take over. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=136.08s)]
*  He says he's imposing a 35% tariff on Canadian products. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=140.52s)]
*  If Canada imposes any type of retaliatory tariff, that percentage will be added to the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=145.68s)]
*  tariffs that the United States is imposing on Canada. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump says that he will keep the tariffs on Canada until they stop sending fentanyl into [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  the United States and killing Americans. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=161.56s)]
*  They are not sending fentanyl into the United States and killing Americans. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=163.88s)]
*  This is like what Putin says about Ukraine denazification. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=168.2s)]
*  And that's what he uses to justify annexation right there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Just take a look at Trump's letter so you see how disgusting and disrespectful it is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump writes, it is a great honor for me to send you this letter and that it demonstrates [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=180.44s)]
*  the strength and commitment of our trading relationship and the fact that the United [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=184.72s)]
*  States of America has agreed to continue working with Canada despite Canada having financially [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  retaliated against the United States. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=195.12s)]
*  What do you mean continue working with Canada? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=197.76s)]
*  They're our neighbor, you idiot. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=200.68s)]
*  They give us energy for us to live here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=202.12s)]
*  You idiot. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=204.84s)]
*  There has been a major trading relationship with them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=205.84s)]
*  We've been best of allies for so long. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=208.52s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=210.96s)]
*  We are going to continue to work with you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=212.28s)]
*  What do you think this is? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  As other people have said, and I think this was a great way of phrasing it, Donald Trump's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=215.78s)]
*  tariff letters look like a multi-level marketing invitation written by a fifth player, a fifth [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=220.42s)]
*  grader and a deranged one. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=227.82s)]
*  No offense to fifth graders. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=229.84s)]
*  Trump goes on to say, as you will recall, the United States imposed tariffs on Canada [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=231.76s)]
*  to deal with our nation's fentanyl crisis, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=235.82s)]
*  I'm not even going to read anymore. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=239.46s)]
*  You understand how deranged it is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=241.08s)]
*  The Nasdaq futures fell off a cliff 15 minutes before Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=243.46s)]
*  imports and then bottom out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=250.68s)]
*  You see the market manipulation right there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=253.0s)]
*  Hat tip to Maine for pointing that out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=255.4s)]
*  Going back to what I showed you at the beginning, anytime Donald Trump posts something right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=259.06s)]
*  now, the question is, where's the freaking Epstein list, Donald? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=263.68s)]
*  Because we know you're covering up because your name is on that list. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  You were best friends with Epstein. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=271.5s)]
*  Epstein used Mar-a-Lago as the grounds to traffic girls like Virginia Joufray who worked [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=273.26s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago underage, found her there and then sex trafficked her. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=277.94s)]
*  You said Epstein's a great guy who likes women on the younger side. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=281.82s)]
*  You sexually assault people, Donald. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  You were found liable for sexual assault and yesterday the Court of Appeals upheld the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=286.94s)]
*  finding that you were liable for sexual assault and defamation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  What a disgusting, vile piece of trash you are. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  There's just no other way to say it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=301.26s)]
*  Oh, by the way, yesterday Prince Andrew as a result of Donald Trump covering up the list, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=302.64s)]
*  Prince Andrew free to travel abroad as FBI ends its probe into Royals, Jeffrey links, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  the FBI shut down the Epstein investigation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=313.48s)]
*  Well done, Donald. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=317.24s)]
*  I'm being sarcastic, of course. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=318.24s)]
*  Even Donald Trump's favorite pollster, Rasmussen, who has all of those polls when everyone else [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  shows that Donald Trump's approval is like in the 30s. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Rasmussen now has Donald Trump negative two, falling from plus eight in June to now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=328.96s)]
*  So it was a negative 10 point drop from the most far right wing of right wing pollsters. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=335.73999999999995s)]
*  When you're negative two on Rasmussen and you're Donald Trump, no bueno, no bueno. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=341.96s)]
*  Oh, and here's some polling. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  Do you think Trump was involved in crimes committed by Epstein? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  40% of the people say yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=352.46s)]
*  There's more things I want to talk about here and how despicable this Trump regime is. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=356.02s)]
*  By the way, where the hell is the head of FEMA? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=360.26s)]
*  Where is the guy? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=363.26s)]
*  Do you even know who the head of FEMA is? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=364.26s)]
*  We haven't seen him on TV. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=367.82s)]
*  He hasn't made any comments. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=369.14s)]
*  He hasn't posted anything. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=370.64s)]
*  He hasn't any press conferences. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=371.64s)]
*  We've heard from the mayor of Kerrville who just yelled that their report is not going [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=373.94s)]
*  to play that tape anymore. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=378.12s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, here's the head of counterterrorism, a 22 year old kid who a few years ago was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=379.12s)]
*  called on by the police. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=385.9s)]
*  Two years back, the police was called on him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=386.9s)]
*  He was 18 years old and he was in a love triangle with a 16 year old girl. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  According to police, he was fighting with a 16 year old boy who was with a 16 year old [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  girl who he liked. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  And this is the head of our counterterrorism. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=402.9s)]
*  No background in counterterrorism at all. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=404.58s)]
*  His name is like Tom Fugate. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=407.17999999999995s)]
*  No, no background of that at all. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=408.82s)]
*  Just he was a Trump supporter. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=410.94s)]
*  So just give it to him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=412.1s)]
*  The same way Donald Trump gave the ambassadorship of Malaysia to a guy who would always talk [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=413.54s)]
*  about Nick Adams, an Australian who came to the United States and then would just always [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  talk about, I'm so alpha. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  I crush M&Ms and take photos of it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=427.98s)]
*  I'm so alpha. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  I go to Hooters every day. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=431.82000000000005s)]
*  That's who we've made the ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  And you on the same day that was announced, there was a meeting between Marco Rubio and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=437.12s)]
*  Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=443.62s)]
*  And then we name the ambassador of Malaysia to Nick freaking Adams. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=446.88s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=452.26s)]
*  Well, this is taking place while Donald Trump says he's going to be tough on Russia and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=453.52s)]
*  he's been saying two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=458.48s)]
*  It's been taco weeks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=460.8s)]
*  Trump always chickens out over and over again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=462.48s)]
*  Russia has escalated more than ever its attacks on Kiev. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=465.36s)]
*  Donald Trump says, oh, I'm going to help Ukraine now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=469.04s)]
*  I will believe it when I see it because we still have Marco Rubio in Malaysia saying [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  Russia offered a new approach during our talks. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't call it a guarantee of peace, but a new approach. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's what Rubio says here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=484.68s)]
*  These ideas that were put on the table today, would you characterize them as new ideas from [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=485.68s)]
*  the Russian side that the Trump administration had not heard before? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=493.0s)]
*  I think maybe yes, I think it's a new and a different approach. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=494.0s)]
*  Again, I wouldn't characterize it as something that guarantees a peace, but it's a concept [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=497.84s)]
*  that we'll take back to the president today and here as soon as I finish with you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=504.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the FBI, at the DOJ and State Department, if you work there on almost a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=511.12s)]
*  regular basis, you get called in and they administer lie detector tests and loyalty [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=517.24s)]
*  oaths. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=523.8s)]
*  They sit you down and they do a lie detector and ask you how much do you love, I'm not [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=524.8s)]
*  making this up, how much do you love Donald Trump? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=529.92s)]
*  How much do you admire Donald Trump? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=532.4s)]
*  Would you ever say anything bad about Donald Trump? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=534.36s)]
*  Would you ever talk to the press and say anything negative about him? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=536.88s)]
*  How handsome do you think he is? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=540.12s)]
*  Some bizarre stuff that they are doing over there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=542.22s)]
*  I can't believe this is real, but this is what our Defense Department is doing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=544.96s)]
*  You've got Pete Hegseth doing the following here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=549.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=552.24s)]
*  This is the videos that they're releasing right now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=553.24s)]
*  And again, just so pathetic. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=555.56s)]
*  Is this what they're just making movies here? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=556.56s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=558.92s)]
*  You're factoring base by producing thousands of American made products prioritizing by [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=559.92s)]
*  Americans. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=564.8s)]
*  We'll arm combat units with a variety of low cost American crafted drones, leveraging [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=565.8s)]
*  our world leading engineers and AI experts. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=571.44s)]
*  And third, we're going to train as we expect to fight. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=575.0s)]
*  And folks, even Donald Trump's former lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, even Trump's former lawyer [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  Dershowitz was on TV saying that the facts and the documents in Epstein are being suppressed. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  This is Trump's lawyer saying it, former lawyer Dershowitz and someone who Trump continued. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=594.72s)]
*  Trump likes Dershowitz. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=599.9000000000001s)]

*  to protect individuals. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=609.0s)]
*  I know the names of the individuals. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=610.24s)]
*  I know why they're being suppressed. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=612.32s)]
*  I know who's suppressing them, but I'm bound by confidentiality from a judge and cases [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=614.32s)]
*  and I can't disclose what I know, but I hand to God, I know, I know the names of people [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=621.12s)]
*  whose files are being suppressed in order to protect them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IUHI5TmU8k&t=627.52s)]
