# Republicans FREAK OUT as Dems GO ON OFFENSE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY)
*  Sometimes, being a disrupter causes pain, and pain is good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what the MAGA Republicans are using as their talking points now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=6.7s)]
*  As Donald Trump's approval is plummeting, they are praising the pain that Trump is inflicting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=11.32s)]
*  upon the nation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=18.42s)]
*  How do you know you're in a cult? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=19.42s)]
*  Maybe because you're saying things like this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  So you had MAGA Republican Congressmember Mauser, he goes on CNN and he goes, pain, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=24.64s)]
*  pain, pain is good. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=31.6s)]
*  What to your play this clip? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=33.64s)]
*  The next presidency because we believe in the plan of the presidents and that is to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=36.16s)]
*  strengthen our national security, strengthen our economy, and sometimes being a disrupter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=41.08s)]
*  causes some short term fallbacks, some short term setbacks. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=47.78s)]
*  But nevertheless, that is not an indicator of long term prosperity. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=56.14s)]
*  We believe in the end, it's not about how you start, it's how you finish. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=60.82s)]
*  We think the markets are coming back and the results in the end are going to be very strong. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=65.12s)]
*  And just so you see, this is like part of their talking points and it's not unique [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=71.9s)]
*  to that MAGA Republican Congressmember. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=75.62s)]
*  You've got MAGA Republican Congressmember Ryan Zink and he's like, yeah, he's from Montana's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  first congressional district and he's like, yeah, you know, Donald Trump's doing shotgun [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=84.54s)]
*  policy and you know, he shoots from the hip, he shoots from the hip, but you know, we deserve [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=89.78s)]
*  it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=94.5s)]
*  Your play this clip. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=95.5s)]
*  The economy is fickle. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=96.5s)]
*  You know, the economy, you know, people are hurting and people are hurting in Montana [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=97.5s)]
*  and tariffs, you know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=101.34s)]
*  The tariffs, the trade war that he's launched against so many countries around the world [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=102.66s)]
*  is a disaster. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=107.78s)]
*  I wouldn't say it is a disaster. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=108.78s)]
*  President Trump has a tendency to do the shotgun, but he also looks for the deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=111.46s)]
*  You know, I'm more of a surgical, former SEAL Team Six. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=116.58s)]
*  I like the surgical, you know, hit rather than the broad shotgun. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=120.86s)]
*  I mean, how are these people real? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  This, they're MAGA, I guess. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=128.18s)]
*  Here's MAGA Republican Congressmember Jason Smith and Jason Smith goes on CNBC. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=130.82s)]
*  It should be a friendly audience for him and they go, look, we've looked at your budget. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=137.62s)]
*  Like you're clearly going to be increasing the deficit by a lot of money. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=143.42s)]
*  So what are you doing here? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=147.18s)]
*  You said you were going to reduce the deficit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=149.26s)]
*  Watch MAGA Republican Congressmember Jason Smith crumble in the most basic question. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=151.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=157.06s)]
*  There's not going to be pay force for these things if it expands the deficit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=158.38s)]
*  And she said, yes, she believes that's the case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=161.3s)]
*  Is that what you see it as as well? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=164.38s)]
*  There's absolutely going to be provisions that eliminate bad tax policy and replacing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=168.18s)]
*  it with better tax policy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=174.44s)]
*  We did that in 2017. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  We're going to do it throughout this process. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=178.18s)]
*  But will it expand the deficit? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=179.94s)]
*  Different loopholes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  Will it expand the deficit? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  The House budget version is much different than the Senate budget version. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=186.17999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, we are going to expand the growth in the economy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  And that's the key. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=195.38s)]
*  If you look at the revenues coming into our country right now under the current Trump [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  tax cuts that are current policy, current law, GDP towards revenue is 17.2 percent. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=202.1s)]
*  If you look at over the last 50 years, it is averaged 17 percent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=209.38s)]
*  We are going to maintain and grow that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=214.48s)]
*  So you know what they're saying? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  They're like Trump's policies, his tariffs, they're working so well that we're going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  to get so rich. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=223.44s)]
*  You know, those Trump gold cards, they're going to make everybody so, so wealthy that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=224.44s)]
*  that's how we're going to make up for the huge deficit, the trillions that we're going [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=229.6s)]
*  to add. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=234.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=235.0s)]
*  I think it was even during the campaign where all of the economists were saying under Donald [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=236.0s)]
*  Trump's plan, all the top economists like in the world, in the country said under Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=241.24s)]
*  Trump's plan, it would add like 15 trillion, like 10 trillion, 15 on the high end, five [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=246.84s)]
*  on the low end or some some numbers like that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=252.8s)]
*  Remember I was like, no, it's going to be like 30 trillion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be like 40 trillion. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=257.76s)]
*  Just take the number, multiply it by the worst case scenario and you get Donald Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=259.58s)]
*  Now look, one of the things that the MAGA Republicans are doing is they're bringing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  these like fake experts or these so-called experts to Congress and they're just getting [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=267.48s)]
*  ripped to shreds also by Democrats. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  So the MAGA Republicans brought in recently these manufacturing and industrial experts [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=277.12s)]
*  to try to say Donald Trump's policies are making America great. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=283.6s)]
*  Like we are making so much money. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  So then Democratic Congress members like Ro Khanna were like, okay, should we talk about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=290.18s)]
*  tariffs because you haven't mentioned that once. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=295.36s)]
*  So what's your view on tariffs? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=298.04s)]
*  And Congress member Khan is like, I'm not asking you a trick question here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  What's just what's your view? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=304.6s)]
*  And then the like Trump MAGA economist experts, all of these people, you know, different there's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  have been different times were like, we're not here to talk about that here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=311.26s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=314.6s)]
*  So the three Republican witnesses come to a hearing on industrial policy and none of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=315.6s)]
*  mentioned the word tariff, not one single one. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=321.88s)]
*  And yet all Donald Trump is doing is tariff policy when the three Republican witnesses [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=324.96s)]
*  are recommending a hundred different things other than tariff policy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=329.88s)]
*  Mr. Bishop, do you agree with Donald Trump's tariff policy? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=334.36s)]
*  I'm not here as an economic expert. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=339.0s)]
*  You're also you're not here as an economic experts and yet you're giving us all these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=342.6s)]
*  recommendations for how we build an industrial base. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=345.84s)]
*  You don't have any expertise that we should just pick up any random citizen or do you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  have are you here as some economic expertise on industrial policy? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  Is that for me? Yes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=360.48s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I misspoke on this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, on tariffs, this is just not one of I mean, like these guys as well. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=363.92s)]
*  We're focused on building companies here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=367.48s)]
*  But I don't understand how there is. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't have the president. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=371.04s)]
*  I states are saying the way to build manufacturing is to have these tariff policies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=372.56s)]
*  You're here to testify on manufacturing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=375.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to build it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=377.64s)]
*  You're telling me you don't have an opinion on whether the Trump tariff policy is [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=378.84s)]
*  successful or not. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  We're here to represent private industry, people who are actually building companies, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  not people who are theoretical. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  This is not a theoretical matter. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=389.28s)]
*  He's implemented tariffs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=390.84s)]
*  I'm not even trying to trick you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=391.96s)]
*  I'm saying, do you agree with all his tariff policies or do you disagree with them? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=393.2s)]
*  Or are you so afraid that you don't know what to say? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  I think all of us have been really clear. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=401.8s)]
*  We're here. This is not what we're here to talk about. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's Democratic Congress member Frost play this clip. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=405.76000000000005s)]
*  But I also have to bring up something that one of my colleagues, Representative Conner, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=409.04s)]
*  had brought up and has to do with the tariffs policy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=413.92s)]
*  While advanced manufacturing create jobs, that number of jobs will pale in comparison [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=417.16s)]
*  to the negative impact of Trump's tariffs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=422.24s)]
*  Tariffs are tax on all consumers. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=425.24s)]
*  They put the heaviest burden of that tax on middle and working class Americans. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=427.16s)]
*  You're shaking your head. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=431.44000000000005s)]
*  One of the witnesses is shaking his head. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=432.44000000000005s)]
*  We just went through this and you all conceded that you know nothing about tariffs and have [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=434.48s)]
*  nothing to say about it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=438.72s)]
*  Here's AOC play this clip. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  We heard just recently with Congressman Trahan's amendment that we don't need any of these [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  amendments to take our word that the word has been given, that Medicaid is going to be [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  protected, to that to trust us that no one is going to be affected by this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  But as a woman, the word was given to me that my rights would not be taken away by [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=458.84s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=464.44s)]
*  And that wasn't true. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=465.64s)]
*  As an American, the word was given that our, you know, our First Amendment protections [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  would be in place for everyone, including green card holders and people who are lawful [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=475.52s)]
*  here in this country. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  That didn't end up to be true. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=480.32s)]
*  My cat is part of the family, plain and simple. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=481.79999999999995s)]
*  So I want them to have the best food that money can buy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=484.28s)]
*  And I didn't realize that for years, the cat food that I was buying had questionable ingredients. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=487.4s)]
*  This podcast is sponsored by Smalls. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=492.4s)]

*  And my cats prefer Smalls way more than their previous cat food. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=520.28s)]
*  I legitimately did a taste test, put two bowls side by side, and they immediately went to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=524.0s)]
*  Smalls. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=529.04s)]
*  Since making the switch to Smalls, my cat has had fewer hair balls, more balanced energy, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  a healthier weight, a softer and shinier fur coat, and a less stinky litter box that's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=534.96s)]
*  big. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=539.88s)]
*  Still not a believer in Smalls. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=540.88s)]
*  Well, New York Magazine called Smalls the best cat food, according to veterinarians. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=543.28s)]
*  While BuzzFeed said, my cats went completely ballistic for this stuff. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=548.28s)]
*  My cat's breath is much better and their fur is much softer ever since I switched to Smalls. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=553.28s)]

*  free speech. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=618.76s)]
*  No, they're like the opposite. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=619.76s)]
*  Obviously, we know that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=621.0s)]
*  I mean, they want to shut down universities. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=622.2s)]
*  They want to shut down the media. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=624.5s)]
*  They want to shut the opposite of free speech. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=625.82s)]
*  Everything with them is like Orwellian dystopian law. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=628.12s)]
*  Orwell would be like, what? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  So when Democratic Congressmember Swalwell confronts Congressmember Higgins because Congressmember [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=632.64s)]
*  Higgins said that we need to arrest, quote, hundreds more judges need to be arrested, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=638.7199999999999s)]
*  Congressmember Swalwell says, which ones? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=646.36s)]
*  Which judges are you saying need to be thrown in gulags? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=648.0s)]
*  To use your words, Congressmember Higgins, watch this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=650.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=655.36s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to give Mr. Higgins the opportunity because I mentioned him earlier [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  and he wasn't here. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=661.96s)]
*  He tweeted yesterday that we should arrest 100 more judges. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=663.88s)]
*  Arrogant, elitist, black robes have been raping our core principles for a decade. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=667.36s)]
*  If the DOJ needs a list, I have it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to yield to Mr. Higgins if he could tell us who those 100 judges are and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=674.72s)]
*  why they should be arrested. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=679.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're here, Mr. Swalwell, to address this amendment and this bill. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=681.5200000000001s)]
*  We're not going to have a back and forth colloquy today, so I'm not going to allow that question. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=689.08s)]
*  You have four minutes and 30 seconds. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=694.8800000000001s)]
*  And do you see that, that the MAGA Republican Congressmember Green's like, we're not going [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=697.6s)]
*  to allow those types of questions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  You can ask questions. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=703.12s)]
*  And finally, Democratic Congressmember Eric Swalwell is like, well, then what are we doing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=705.48s)]
*  here? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=709.4000000000001s)]
*  What is the point of this? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=710.48s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=711.48s)]
*  Why are we here at all? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=712.48s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=715.24s)]
*  We're 100 days in to this administration and the president promised he would lower prices [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=716.24s)]
*  on day one. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=726.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is 0 for 100. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=729.28s)]
*  He's 0 for 100. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=734.8s)]
*  Prices are not going down. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=737.36s)]
*  They're going up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=739.12s)]
*  The Trump tariff tax is raising prices on the four out of five items in every American's [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=740.68s)]
*  Walmart shopping cart. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=747.68s)]
*  Your 401ks, they're 201ks. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the Trump slump. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=755.88s)]
*  Americans were anxious about the economy when they voted last November. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=759.28s)]
*  They wanted their costs to go down. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=763.52s)]
*  They didn't want the chaos to go up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=765.64s)]
*  So what are we doing here? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=769.88s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=772.68s)]
*  What in this hearing achieves lowering costs for the American people? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=774.84s)]
*  You know how far you have deviated from lowering the costs for American people? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=784.72s)]
*  This is where you are. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=791.4s)]
*  Today, you will make it easier to deport more American citizen children with cancer. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=794.4s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=807.48s)]
*  Today's vote will make it easier for the president to deport more American children with cancer. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=810.12s)]
*  That makes me sick. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=818.4s)]
*  I have a seven-year-old, a six-year-old, and a three-year-old. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=822.28s)]
*  You don't have to be a parent to understand how cruel this is. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=827.28s)]
*  That in the last two weeks, a four-year-old was separated from his father, a U.S. citizen, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=835.52s)]
*  and deported with his mother while he was suffering stage four cancer and undergoing cancer treatment. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=844.76s)]
*  That's where we're at right now. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=853.24s)]
*  By the way, I interviewed yesterday Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, one of my favorite parts of the interview. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=855.12s)]
*  He said what I think I've always wanted to hear Democrats saying, which is Trump needs to be... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=861.8s)]
*  Trump's cognitive ain't there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=866.68s)]
*  Trump ain't thinking right. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=868.64s)]
*  Like, how are all these MAGA Republicans and media talking about former President Biden [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=869.8s)]
*  when we see Trump every day and it's so obvious that he's unfit to be anywhere near the Oval Office? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=873.76s)]
*  Hat tip to Democratic leader Jeffries for this one. Play this clip. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=879.28s)]
*  Donald Trump spent the last year and a half questioning the cognitive ability of President Joe Biden, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=882.84s)]
*  notwithstanding many of the legislative accomplishments that Donald Trump could only wish he got over the finish line. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=888.24s)]
*  And so I think it's fair that a lot of Americans across the country that I run into are questioning [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=895.0s)]
*  whether Donald Trump is actually fit at this point to be able to carry out the duties of the United States of America [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=900.52s)]
*  in terms of being the president and the commander in chief. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=907.6s)]
*  And finally, here's Democratic Congress member Kassar. Play it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=911.48s)]
*  Trump has created a government by and for the billionaires. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=916.04s)]
*  And if anyone ever doubted that Trump and Musk and Bezos and the billionaires are all at one team, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=920.64s)]
*  just look at what happened at Amazon today. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=927.0s)]
*  Bezos immediately caved and walked back a plan to tell Americans how much Trump's tariffs are costing them. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=929.44s)]
*  Bezos, who spent 40 million dollars on Melania Trump's documentary, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=937.44s)]
*  wants big tax cuts and sweetheart deals much more than he wants to represent the American people. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=943.44s)]
*  The message to our… [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=950.96s)]
*  I mean, you saw what went down yesterday, right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=952.12s)]
*  Amazon was going to post on its website how their products were impacted by the tariffs. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=956.12s)]
*  Transparency, right? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  So the consumers would know, why is my product going up 20, 30, 50x? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=963.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, percent, $10, $30, $50. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=968.9200000000001s)]
*  Why is it so much more money? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=970.9200000000001s)]
*  And then Donald Trump calls Bezos and says, Donald Trump admits to this. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=973.48s)]
*  Shut it down. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=977.6s)]
*  And then Bezos, to protect his tax cuts or whatever his oligarchy, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=978.9200000000001s)]
*  removes the tariffs from the website. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag5PiepvPY&t=983.56s)]
