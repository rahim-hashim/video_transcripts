Video Description: On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: Donald Trump escalates his war on the American people by deploying Marines into Los Angeles, all while planning a grotesque military parade later this week. California Governor Gavin Newsom steps up in a major way, launching a legal counteroffensive as the state sues Trump for his unlawful actions. Meanwhile, the Republican budget bill is stuck in limbo, and Trump’s so-called trade deals are exposed as nothing more than smoke and mirrors. We break it all down—and more.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 6/9/25
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI)
*  Donald Trump is going to war with America, sending the National Guard and even potentially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=0.0s)]
*  the Marines against the people living in the United States of America. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=6.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is terrorizing America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=11.28s)]
*  He began with ICE raids, not targeting criminals, targeting hardworking migrants. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  They were going to factories, to courtrooms. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=22.44s)]
*  They were going to Home Depot parking lots. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=26.32s)]
*  They're going to schools and neighborhoods, ripping families apart to try to incite anger, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=28.48s)]
*  confusion, sadness within these communities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=35.28s)]
*  Then protests were peaceful here in California. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=40.4s)]
*  Just take a look at what the LAPD had to say. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=44.08s)]
*  The LAPD, as of Fridays, thanking the organizers for peaceful protests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=47.04s)]
*  Sure, there were certain protests where there were some agitators and they could be dealt with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=52.64s)]
*  by the LAPD and the LA sheriffs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=57.84s)]
*  We have more police here in California than most countries have in military, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=61.2s)]
*  but Donald Trump very quickly escalated this intentionally to be provocative, to cause violence, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=66.56s)]
*  to provoke a situation where he would then call the National Guard, unlawfully I might add, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=74.4s)]
*  where he used a statute, which is not the statute that should be used. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=80.56s)]
*  There's no statute that should be used to federalize the National Guard and send them [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=85.36s)]
*  against people here in the United States of America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=90.8s)]
*  California has responded with a lawsuit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=94.32s)]
*  We'll talk about that on this episode. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=96.72s)]
*  Trump is quite literally going to war with the state of California. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=100.8s)]
*  He's saying that California Governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=105.92s)]
*  notably when Donald Trump sees Governor Newsom face to face. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  He never goes new scum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=115.36s)]
*  In fact, as we showed you when it came to the wildfires, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  when Donald Trump visited Los Angeles and Gavin Newsom met him at the tarmac, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=120.24s)]
*  Donald Trump cowered away, only said nice things in Newsom's face. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  When he's a little keyboard warrior, goes new scum. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  He says, bring in the troops! [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=133.76s)]
*  Exclamation point. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=135.2s)]
*  This is unprecedented times that we're living in in American history. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=137.28s)]
*  While Donald Trump prepares a dictator parade for himself, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=142.0s)]
*  a military parade for himself on June 14th in Washington, D.C., [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=147.04s)]
*  we see hundreds, if not thousands of tanks and missiles rolling into D.C. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=152.32s)]
*  each and every day, a site that makes the United States look like North Korea [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  or Vladimir Putin's Russia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=162.56s)]
*  While we talk about what's happening though in California and Los Angeles, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=165.28s)]
*  I don't want to lose sight of the fact that the MAGA Republicans [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  are pushing through a disastrous budget bill that's going to take away health care [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=172.56s)]
*  from 15 million Americans. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=176.96s)]
*  That's going to be the biggest transfer of wealth in American history [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=179.04s)]
*  from low-income Americans to the wealthiest. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=183.04s)]
*  The wealthiest billionaires and decamillionaires [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=185.76s)]
*  will be getting trillions of dollars in tax cuts paid for by ripping away [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=188.8s)]
*  people's health care and food stamps and other essential services [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=192.96s)]
*  that low-income and working-class people need to live. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=197.68s)]
*  I don't want to get distracted. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  I think we need to focus on everything at the same time here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Also, I don't want to forget about the fact that Donald Trump is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  failing the United States, would be an understatement internationally, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=212.96s)]
*  basically, allying himself with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=216.56s)]
*  And America is no longer the leader of the free world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=220.4s)]
*  And we're seeing Europe step up to help President Zelensky. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=223.28s)]
*  But I don't want to forget about the ultimate betrayal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=227.28s)]
*  Donald Trump has done to Ukraine and to our allies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=230.48s)]
*  So we'll talk about all of that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=234.56s)]
*  Let's bring in Brett and Jordy, brothers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=236.24s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=238.4s)]
*  And for those out there who don't know, well, Jordy lives out of state. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=239.84s)]
*  Brett and I live in Los Angeles. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=245.2s)]
*  For many years, I was living in downtown Los Angeles, working in downtown Los Angeles. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=248.72s)]
*  My wife grew up and my wife's family currently lives in an area called Huntington Park. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  My wife is first-generation American. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  Her family's from Guadalajara. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=266.32s)]
*  I've seen the videos today of the principal at the graduation for middle school students. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=269.12s)]
*  Talking to the parents about ICE. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=274.8s)]
*  Circling around the middle school where my wife went to middle school, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  where her nieces and nephews were graduating today. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=280.48s)]
*  Seeing ICE agents chase after people in Home Depot parking lots. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=284.24s)]
*  Pregnant women going into factories there and in downtown LA and Paramount and Santa Fe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=290.24s)]
*  and other areas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  They're not going after criminals. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=297.04s)]
*  They're going after hardworking families, ripping them apart to torture [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=298.72s)]
*  and terrorize. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=304.08s)]
*  They're terrorists. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=304.8s)]
*  They're terrorists. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=306.08s)]
*  I just, I don't want to hold back how I feel and what the language is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=306.96s)]
*  because I know corporate news is not beating the moment. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  But Brett and Jordy, I'll throw it to you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=312.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=314.56s)]
*  And this is a war against the United States. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=314.8s)]
*  This is a war against Los Angeles. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=317.12s)]
*  And Donald Trump, why is he doing this? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=319.2s)]
*  Because he has authoritarian dreams. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=320.96s)]
*  Because he wants to use this as a predicate in order to invade not just Los Angeles, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=324.0s)]
*  but the entire country to declare martial law. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=328.88s)]
*  I want everybody to know from the top. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=331.6s)]
*  I want to be extremely clear about this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=334.0s)]
*  Everything that's happening right now is 100% manufactured by Donald Trump. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=336.72s)]
*  This is the most contrived quote unquote crisis that I have ever seen since I began doing this, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=342.0s)]
*  probably even before. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=348.8s)]
*  And it's so they're not even being subtle about what they are doing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=350.24s)]
*  There's been no issues here in Los Angeles. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=353.36s)]
*  There were no issues here in Los Angeles until Donald Trump and his goons got here [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  in order to stoke violence, in order to stoke chaos. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=361.36s)]
*  And that's exactly what they are doing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=364.56s)]
*  They are trying to instill fear in people. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  They are doing everything they can to make the problem worse [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=370.0s)]
*  because Donald Trump is a one-man wrecking machine. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  And he is backed up by a bunch of sycophants who accept his false presentation of reality, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=376.24s)]
*  which bears zero resemblance to reality at all. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=382.8s)]
*  And they move forward with this propaganda in a very 1984 style way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  What they also do is they take little images, little clips here and there of things that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=390.72s)]
*  happened, and they blow these up and try to act like this is what's happening everywhere. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  If you're on social media right now, or if you're watching Fox, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=399.12s)]
*  you'll probably think LA doesn't even exist anymore. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  To you, it's probably, oh, it's an apocalyptic hellhole. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=405.04s)]
*  Everyone must just be running for the hills right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=407.92s)]
*  The whole city's on fire. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=410.56s)]
*  The whole city's a mess. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=411.92s)]
*  I want to be absolutely clear about that as well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=413.36s)]
*  As ICE terrorizes people in these select neighborhoods and areas, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=416.72s)]
*  and a lot of the images that what you're seeing right now are confined to a few blocks in downtown LA. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  And if you're not in those few blocks of downtown LA right now, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=426.48s)]
*  I bet a lot of people in the city don't even know anything's going on here, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=429.36s)]
*  as crazy as that may sound and as crazy as it may be. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=432.16s)]
*  And the only reason I want to highlight that is because you have all these propagandists. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  You have Donald Trump. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=438.8s)]
*  You have the Sean Hannity's. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  You have all these folks trying to act like the entire city right now [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=440.8s)]
*  is burning down, like the entire city right now is rioting, that there's all this chaos happening. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=445.12s)]
*  And they want to use that false information in order to allow Donald Trump to do the things [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=450.64s)]
*  that he is doing, to allow him to increase the power of the federal government, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=455.68s)]
*  to allow him to send the Marines into Los Angeles, to federalize the National Guard. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=459.76s)]
*  He is using this propaganda to do really, really, really terrible things. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=465.2s)]
*  When, if you go out in Los Angeles right now, like I was out all weekend, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=470.24s)]
*  my friends are out, I see family members out, you see neighbors out, people are in parks, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=474.16s)]
*  you know, people are at farmer's markets, people are going to the beach, the weather is beautiful, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=479.36s)]
*  people are hiking. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=483.2s)]
*  Like the images that you see on TV don't line up with the reality of what's going on here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=484.48s)]
*  Yet, despite that fact, despite the fact that there were these peaceful protests, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=490.32s)]
*  Donald Trump decided to come in here and decided to start shit. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=494.88s)]
*  He decided to start trouble. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=498.64s)]
*  He decided to try to provoke people, to try to get these images, and everything that you're [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=500.32s)]
*  seeing in those areas that I was describing, all those images out of downtown when you see smoke [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  or whatever it is, that's all because of Donald Trump. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  And this would end in a second if Donald Trump got the hell out of my city. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=512.72s)]
*  And he needs to get the hell out of my city because what he's doing here is dangerous. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=516.32s)]
*  It's the same thing he does everywhere he goes. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=519.92s)]
*  It's the same thing he did when we're talking about hurricanes in North Carolina [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=521.92s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=526.48s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=527.76s)]
*  Donald Trump did everything he possibly could to make the problem worse. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=528.32s)]
*  When there were fires in Los Angeles, Donald Trump did everything he possibly could [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  to make the fires worse. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=535.44s)]
*  When there was COVID, Donald Trump did everything he possibly could to make the problem worse. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=536.72s)]
*  Ron Philip, the Kovacosky Editor-in-Chief, I'm paraphrasing something that he said online [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=541.7600000000001s)]
*  the other day, but it was something along the lines of Donald Trump has not been successful [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=545.36s)]
*  at anything in his life. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=548.96s)]
*  All of his businesses were failures. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=550.08s)]
*  He's been a complete and total failure of a human being. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=551.7600000000001s)]
*  But the one thing that he's been incredibly successful at is dividing Americans and stoking [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=554.56s)]
*  conflict, stoking chaos. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what he is doing right now. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=561.04s)]
*  He stokes the chaos. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=563.92s)]
*  He then uses it for his political benefit. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=565.28s)]
*  He uses it to try to take more power away from the people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=567.52s)]
*  And that's why we need to remain on guard here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=570.64s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do as we cover this every single day here at the Midas Touch [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=572.8s)]
*  Network. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=576.64s)]
*  Jordy, let's go. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  Powerful intro, brothers. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=577.68s)]
*  Benji, why don't we just kick it to you? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=578.8s)]
*  Where do you want to start off? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=579.92s)]
*  I'm going to have certainly more to add, but I want to start the show. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  Look, things were peaceful here in Los Angeles and in the surrounding communities, both the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=584.16s)]
*  city and the surrounding areas in the county of Los Angeles. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=589.6s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=595.36s)]
*  Every city has its problems and has its issues. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not trying to portray this as a perfect utopia. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=599.6s)]
*  Far from it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=603.28s)]
*  A lot of things that could be addressed. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=604.4s)]
*  But people were going about living their lives. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=606.08s)]
*  You had hardworking people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  We are a community made up of immigrants. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=611.84s)]
*  A major percentage of people who live here are first generation, second generation. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have a lot of people who are recently here in the United States or they came here [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=620.88s)]
*  undocumented. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=626.4s)]
*  That's part of the cultural fabric of Los Angeles. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  And we embrace diversity here in Los Angeles and in California. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=632.48s)]
*  You think about it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  California is the fourth largest GDP, not in the United States, in the entire world. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=638.08s)]
*  If you want to think about diversity being a strength or a weakness, think about the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=646.24s)]
*  state that probably has the most diversity in the entire country like California with [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  lots of people from Latin America, from Mexico, Caribbean, from Africa, from Europe, from [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=657.76s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  From Mexico, from everywhere. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=668.0s)]
*  And it is the fourth largest GDP in the entire world. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=669.76s)]
*  California is a donor state unlike most of the red states which are taker states. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  And so while Donald Trump has been trying to find different ways to attack California, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=680.16s)]
*  I think California Governor Newsom has done a really good job and a great job, I think, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  specifically as it relates to Donald Trump federalizing the National Guard. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=690.0s)]
*  We'll talk about that in a world. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  But it started right with the wildfires. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=696.0s)]
*  Donald Trump taking, spreading all of these lies about the wildfires, then taking billions [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=698.16s)]
*  of gallons of water from Northern California that weren't even connected any way to the fires. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=704.4s)]
*  And after the fires were fully contained, rerouting that water, kind of flooding farmland [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=710.64s)]
*  and removing it from dams that was holding on to the water in case there was a dry season. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=717.6s)]
*  So they started off with that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted to escalate with a transgender athlete who came in like tied for second place [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  based on the rules where a transgender woman became second place. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=733.76s)]
*  And so Donald Trump said based on allowing her to compete in what was like a long jumping [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=739.12s)]
*  competition or something where, again, it was like tied for second place because they changed [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=744.32s)]
*  the rules in terms of how you can do it in a way that seemed to be a compromise that people were [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=748.96s)]
*  happy about except for people who want to provoke. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=756.88s)]
*  Trump says, I'm going to withhold all federal funding, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=759.44s)]
*  To which California Governor Gavin Newsom said, well, then I'm going to withhold the federal. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=762.32s)]
*  We give all the red, we fund the red states in California. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=767.44s)]
*  We don't complain about it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=771.2s)]
*  We don't whine about it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  We're the biggest contributors to the federal government, more than $80 billion. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=773.92s)]
*  So what if we don't do that? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  To then all of a sudden, then the MAGA plays the victim, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=781.92s)]
*  You have Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=784.64s)]
*  We're going to go after you for unlawful tax evasion. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=786.8s)]
*  Is that a threat? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  We're going to arrest Gavin Newsom for that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  So they were going in that direction. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=791.92s)]
*  And then they kind of waited to do these coordinated ICE raids, focusing on the Los Angeles area. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  What they did, again, was not going after the criminals. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=802.8s)]
*  They went after the cities and towns that were like Huntington Park, like Downey, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  like Paramount, for those who are in LA who know those towns, that have big Mexican populations, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=813.6s)]
*  largely, but from other countries, other Latin American countries, Central America, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  South America, as well. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=828.72s)]
*  And they would go to the Home Depots where people would be waiting to work. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  And then the ICE agents wearing masks dressed in a very militarized fashion would snatch them off [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=835.76s)]
*  the streets, chase them, snatch them. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=841.92s)]
*  Then they kind of make a scene out of it, creating a situation. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=844.0s)]
*  Then they would raid these factories, apparel factories, and sewing factories, knitting [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=849.04s)]
*  factories, people who were just engaged in a hard day's labor, and people who had been [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=855.04s)]
*  living their own American dream. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  They'd go back to their communities. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  And ICE would target these places of work. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=863.5999999999999s)]
*  Then ICE targeted the courthouses, people who were going through a lawful process. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  ICE would be waiting in the bushes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  They'd be waiting inside the courtrooms. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  And they were testing this all throughout the country in smaller places before they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=875.68s)]
*  really launched their big, full mission here in Los Angeles. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=881.04s)]
*  Then they're waiting in a courthouse called Roy Ball in downtown. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=886.64s)]
*  And then they just started detaining everybody, throwing them into the basement, regardless [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=890.48s)]
*  of what their status was. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=895.76s)]
*  And we showed videos of this where you could hear people saying, daddy, daddy, where are you? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=896.96s)]
*  You'd hear people screaming out of a horror movie. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=902.72s)]
*  And so they were doing that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=908.96s)]
*  And so then you started to have the peaceful protests develop. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=910.4s)]
*  Now, one of the things that ICE did right away, and they did this on purpose, is they [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=913.76s)]
*  attacked a major labor leader in California, a guy named David Huerta, who leads the SCIU [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=917.84s)]
*  union here in Los Angeles. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=925.28s)]
*  And he's the president of the union in California. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  And you take a look at this video, and they literally just throw him to the ground, arrest [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=931.04s)]
*  him. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=936.64s)]
*  And then the Department of Justice charges him with obstructing official ICE duties. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=937.04s)]
*  So they were looking at these various kind of touch points to provoke this. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=943.12s)]
*  Still, you had the peaceful protests through Thursday, even through Friday. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=947.36s)]
*  The LAPD issued a press release thanking the organizers for peaceful protests, talking [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=952.64s)]
*  about the coordination to make sure that the protests were peaceful. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=958.48s)]
*  Were there some sporadic incidents of agitators? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=963.12s)]
*  Yes, there were. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=967.28s)]
*  But very small groupings. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  Did those get an inordinate amount of media attention? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=971.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=974.24s)]
*  But small incidents. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=975.04s)]
*  And on that basis, Donald Trump then invokes or calls up the National Guard, federalizing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=977.04s)]
*  the National Guard under a statute called 10 USC section 12406, which it's not the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=985.28s)]
*  Insurrection Act. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=994.8s)]
*  It's something else. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=996.48s)]
*  And it transmits a memo to the Department of Defense. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=998.0s)]
*  But when you invoke this act, it has very strict requirements. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1004.24s)]
*  And it says when you look through it, when you look through the statute, 10 USC section [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1008.88s)]
*  12406, it says that you have to coordinate with the governors of the states as part of [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1014.56s)]
*  your duties. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1022.88s)]
*  There has to be coordination with the governor, and the governor has to be the one who you [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1024.16s)]
*  transmit, and the governor has to be the one basically to approve it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1028.72s)]
*  And it could only be invoked when there's repelling and invasion of the United States [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1032.48s)]
*  by a foreign nation, suppressing a rebellion against the authority of the government of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  the United States, or that the president can no longer execute the laws of the United States [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1041.92s)]
*  anymore. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  None of those qualifications were met. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1049.92s)]
*  Trump did not mention any of this to California Governor Newsom. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1052.8s)]
*  He just sent a letter to the adjudicant general of the National Guard, the leader, the head [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1057.36s)]
*  of the National Guard in California, which is run by the governor. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not supposed to be run by the federal government, invoke the statute and said, we're [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1066.48s)]
*  making the federal, we're federalizing the National Guard. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1071.04s)]
*  Now, Trump didn't even have the resources for these National Guard troops. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1075.28s)]
*  So they had to actually sleep on the floor. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1079.84s)]
*  They didn't have food. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1083.1999999999998s)]
*  The San Francisco Chronicle did a good, they didn't have equipment. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  San Francisco Chronicle did a really good report on this. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1088.6399999999999s)]
*  And for those audio listeners, we're showing those who are watching on our YouTube channel, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1091.28s)]
*  the National Guard sleeping on the floor. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1096.0s)]
*  And once the National Guard were activated, and then there was the threat also by Secretary [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1099.84s)]
*  of Defense Pete Hegseth to call in the Marines from Camp Pendleton to turn the Marines and put [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1106.0s)]
*  the Marines and work through the different types of engagement. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1115.44s)]
*  In other words, the levels of engagement and the rules of engagement of when you can basically [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1122.08s)]
*  shoot to kill protesters and how to use lethal versus non-lethal. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1127.68s)]
*  But then Hegseth said, I'm sending basically the Marines in and the Marines were then [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1132.72s)]
*  activated. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1139.52s)]
*  All while Donald Trump was making social media post after social media troops, bring in the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1140.4s)]
*  troops! Exclamation point. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1145.12s)]
*  If you spit, we hit. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1147.2s)]
*  You spit, we hit. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1151.2s)]
*  And he was again trying to provoke and make people very, very, very upset in the communities. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1152.8s)]
*  And when you rip people apart from their families, that's going to be the natural consequences. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1160.32s)]
*  So we saw Trump escalate, Trump provoke. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1166.24s)]
*  I also before throwing it back to you, Brett and Jordi, and I'm sorry if I kind of rambled [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  a little bit there, just so everybody knows how the process would normally work. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1173.92s)]
*  As I mentioned at the outset, between the LAPD and the LA sheriffs, there are more police than [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1178.16s)]
*  most nations have in their entire army working for the combined LA sheriffs and the LAPD. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1186.72s)]
*  There's an escalation protocol within the LAPD and LA sheriffs. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1194.32s)]
*  And then if they don't have the resources, after going to the highest level of escalation, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1199.2s)]
*  they didn't even have to go anywhere near that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1205.04s)]
*  There's then a process where they can reach out to other counties and cities to ask them [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1208.4s)]
*  for support within the state. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1214.64s)]
*  Then if that escalation doesn't work, then the governor can use the National Guard. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1216.96s)]
*  If the governor feels they're unable to utilize the National Guard themselves effectively, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1222.64s)]
*  then the governor's the one who requests of the president, hey, we need your help, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1228.64s)]
*  we need federal resources, which has very rarely happened throughout American history. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  And even before then, then the governors often reach out to other governors in other states [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1239.92s)]
*  states' rights. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1245.2800000000002s)]
*  Where have we heard that? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1246.48s)]
*  States' rights. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1247.44s)]
*  And then the states help out California before you get to a declaration, essentially, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1248.64s)]
*  of an insurrection under the Insurrection Act or a federalization of the National Guard, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1255.5200000000002s)]
*  which I read for you the categories, foreign invasion, rebellion, or the inability of the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1263.2800000000002s)]
*  president to execute laws anymore. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1270.88s)]
*  And that didn't happen. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1272.88s)]
*  But Trump was thirsty for this moment. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1274.64s)]
*  And I want to add this important factor, because when we come back, we'll talk more about [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  the lawsuit that California filed, the implications of that lawsuit. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1282.96s)]
*  But when Trump invoked this statute, he also did it for a period of 60 days. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1288.96s)]
*  And it doesn't mention Los Angeles or California. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  It says 2,000 National Guard troops to start. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  But then it says, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, it can be raised to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1303.28s)]
*  whatever. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1309.36s)]
*  And it's not limited to California. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1310.16s)]
*  What this declaration allows is any state, in any city within any state, in any county, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1312.96s)]
*  for the next 60 days, it's basically a way to declare martial law without actually saying it, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1321.92s)]
*  is what this declaration is doing. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1330.8s)]
*  It's a way to invoke a military dictatorship without actually saying those terms. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1333.04s)]
*  Because think about it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1340.0s)]
*  If in a 60-day period, you've given your power, you've given yourself the power away from [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1340.96s)]
*  governors to put the military anywhere in the United States, which is what this gives Trump [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1347.28s)]
*  and Pete Hegseth the power to do, how is that not a dictatorship? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  Frankly, how is anything that Trump did before not a dictatorship? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1358.88s)]
*  I've been saying we've been living in an authoritarian regime already. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1364.5600000000002s)]
*  And then I'll layer this last piece on, this last piece on, which is I think that the timing of [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1369.0400000000002s)]
*  this is very much related to the military, the dictator parade that Donald Trump is holding [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1376.96s)]
*  on June 14th, which is his birthday. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1385.2800000000002s)]
*  Thousands of tanks and missiles and soldiers, they're all headed to Washington, D.C. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1387.68s)]
*  And I think that Trump views that day symbolically always as his dictator day. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  He wants not just the trappings of dictator, but the force of dictatorship. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1402.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I think that all of this is also related to that date in particular. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1408.0s)]
*  And I think that Trump and the regime know, the no-kings protests and a lot of other people and a [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1414.32s)]
*  lot of other related protests are going to be happening on that June 14th. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1420.56s)]
*  And I think they want a military presence to try to shut down those protests, scare those protests [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  away. And it's my belief right now, America is currently a dictatorship. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1432.08s)]
*  I don't think that's a controversial thing to say. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1440.08s)]
*  You don't hear that in corporate news. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1444.32s)]
*  America is no longer a democracy. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1446.4799999999998s)]
*  America is a dictatorship. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1449.84s)]
*  We live under an authoritarian regime led by an idiot. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1452.2399999999998s)]
*  Still very dangerous. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1457.1999999999998s)]
*  It's an idiocracy, a cacostocracy, the Trump regime. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1458.3999999999999s)]
*  Congress has all these MAGA Mike Johnson and all these MAGA morons who just do whatever Donald Trump [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1461.36s)]
*  does. No different. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1470.8s)]
*  Look, there's a parliament in North Korea. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1472.0s)]
*  There's a parliament in Russia. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1475.9199999999998s)]
*  They're made up of MAGA Mike Johnson types who do what Putin wants, who does what Kim Jong-un [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1480.32s)]
*  wants. And they say they have a parliamentary system and they don't. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1485.12s)]
*  That's what exists right now, at least before the midterms. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1488.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to try to make sure we don't have elections in the midterms with the military. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1491.6799999999998s)]
*  That's to me part of what this plan is right here. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1499.4399999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1502.56s)]
*  I'm not trying to say this to be hyperbolic. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  When we come back from the break, we'll show you the receipts. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1507.6s)]
*  I'll show you what it is he's saying, calling for Newsom to be arrested, sending the Marines, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1511.12s)]
*  sending them, calling in the National Guard. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1516.08s)]
*  You know, we'll show you the facts Trump's saying that he wants to have troops everywhere. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  We'll show you the receipts. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1522.3999999999999s)]
*  We need to be prepared. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1523.9199999999998s)]
*  We need to look at this clear-eyed. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1525.1999999999998s)]
*  We need to understand the reality. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1528.32s)]
*  You also layer in the fact that what you had that great reporter at ABC, Terry Moran, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  who criticized Trump and Stephen Miller for what they've been doing in a post. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1537.36s)]
*  And then the Trump regime calls Disney and immediately Terry Moran gets suspended. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1543.76s)]
*  The regime calls the media company and then the media company suspends the reporter [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  for saying that what Trump and Miller are doing is cruel because it hurts the regime's feelings. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1555.12s)]
*  It was a long rant by me. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1561.2s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1562.56s)]
*  But I think I had to, I don't know how else I could cover the developments of what has happened. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1563.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1569.68s)]
*  What else can you say there, Ben? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1570.32s)]
*  You summed it up perfectly. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1571.68s)]
*  I know it's deeply personal for you, especially with your family and your daughter. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1573.04s)]
*  And just it's so insane to see this play out on such just a human level. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1576.56s)]
*  This is just so not right what we're witnessing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1581.12s)]
*  And don't be gaslit by anyone into thinking that any of this is normal. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1583.68s)]
*  And Ben, I think it's very astute of you to also bring up what's happening this weekend. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1587.84s)]
*  I think there's a larger macro picture here of this authoritarian playbook 101 that we're [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  witnessing unfold before our eyes. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1598.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1600.32s)]
*  So when you're looking at what Trump's doing this week, instigating this civil uneasiness, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1600.96s)]
*  going into these communities, going into middle, sending ICE into middle schools. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  And this is disgusting stuff, dystopian stuff, sending ICE to Home Depot. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1610.88s)]
*  These aren't criminals. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1616.72s)]
*  These are pillars of the community that he's disappearing. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  And so, of course, people are going to be upset by this. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1622.96s)]
*  This isn't even necessarily what he campaigned on. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1625.8400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1629.6000000000001s)]
*  He said, we're getting the criminals out of here. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1629.76s)]
*  Tell me a middle school student that's committed a crime of this severity. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1632.16s)]
*  I mean, it is absolutely disgusting. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1635.68s)]
*  And then you fast forward here and you're looking at this weekend. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1638.56s)]
*  And I'm going to say this because, you know, Bill Maher, before he went sideways, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1642.4s)]
*  used to really say this a lot. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1646.24s)]
*  And I really appreciate it when he dug in here. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1648.16s)]
*  Military style parades in the streets of the United States. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1652.16s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1655.68s)]
*  That stuff you see out of North Korea. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1657.04s)]
*  That is disgusting. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1659.1999999999998s)]
*  That's stuff you see in Russia. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1660.32s)]
*  That is disgusting. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1662.08s)]
*  And so now to celebrate quote unquote, dear leader's birthday, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1663.84s)]
*  not only are we disappearing people from the streets of Los Angeles, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  but now we're going to hold a military parade in honor of dear leader. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1678.0s)]
*  Like, I know our audience is as frustrated and disgusted and appalled as we are. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1679.12s)]
*  I know y'all are. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1685.52s)]
*  This isn't normal. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1687.1999999999998s)]
*  Like this really is unhinged, maniacal, disgusting behavior. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1688.64s)]
*  And there's no other way to look at it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1693.2s)]
*  You cannot normalize this stuff for not even a second. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1695.68s)]
*  Brett. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1701.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to disagree with you in one thing. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1702.0800000000002s)]
*  This is exactly what Donald Trump ran on. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1704.3200000000002s)]
*  This is exactly what he said he would do time and time again. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1706.5600000000002s)]
*  And everybody constantly said, oh, he doesn't mean that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1709.8400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't mean that he's going to do that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1713.0400000000002s)]
*  No, we told you time and time again that he meant [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1714.96s)]
*  exactly what he was saying he was going to do. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1718.08s)]
*  And now he is doing it. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1720.72s)]
*  And now we are seeing the chaos of this. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  Heck, Kamala Harris warned about this on the campaign trail. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1723.52s)]
*  And we have the receipts if we have time. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  We'll play at least a clip of her warning about this back in, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1727.9199999999998s)]
*  this is at least October 2024, speaking about the actions that Trump was threatening. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1731.1999999999998s)]
*  And I want to just paint the picture for you clearly. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1736.24s)]
*  And this goes off what Ben was saying before. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1739.1999999999998s)]
*  Right now you have 700 Marines being mobilized and sent into Los Angeles for no reason. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1741.52s)]
*  There's no reason to ever do that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  You have that happening here. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1751.12s)]
*  You have the National Guard here in Los Angeles. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1752.32s)]
*  You have Donald Trump saying that he is going to Camp David [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1755.36s)]
*  to meet with his top military leaders to discuss strategy, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1759.6s)]
*  to discuss a lot of important issues right now. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  So he's going to meet with top military people at Camp David. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  You have those two things. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1767.84s)]
*  In addition to that, you have these harrowing images of tanks [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  rolling into Washington, D.C. for Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1772.8s)]
*  I think when you put all those things together, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1776.32s)]
*  when you take any one of them by himself, they look bad enough. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1777.6s)]
*  But you put those three things together that are all converging on this exact week right now. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1780.48s)]
*  I think it's a recipe for disaster. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1784.7199999999998s)]
*  And I think it bodes very poorly for what his plans are for the summer. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1787.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  The people are fighting back. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1793.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think one of our last vestiges of hope that we have here, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1794.8s)]
*  as the people who abdicate their responsibility, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1798.0s)]
*  the politicians, the media, you name it, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1800.24s)]
*  we have our voices and I think that's important. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  And as long as we're able to speak our truth here on the Midas Touch Podcast, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1805.12s)]
*  as long as you are able to go out and are able to combat this disinformation and speak out, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1809.1999999999998s)]
*  whether it's on social media, whether it's text message chats to friends and family members, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1814.2399999999998s)]
*  we all need to continue to use our voices to spread the truth, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1819.6s)]
*  to get out the word as to what is actually going on here. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1823.04s)]
*  And I also just want to sound the alarm because the propaganda that's going to be pushed by [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1826.7199999999998s)]
*  not only just right-wing media, but by media in general who wants to see conflict, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1832.08s)]
*  the comments that are going to come out of the White House that are going to be reaffirmed by [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1837.28s)]
*  folks in Congress who are supposed to be people who you would ordinarily be able to trust [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1841.28s)]
*  in situations like this, they're going to constantly be spreading lies. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1845.84s)]
*  They're going to constantly be trying to paint images of Los Angeles that don't reflect reality, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1849.44s)]
*  images of other cities that are most likely, I'm going to say definitely, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  going to be cities that are democratic. They're going to paint images of cities like that in the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1859.44s)]
*  same light. They're going to keep pushing this propaganda in order so that Donald Trump can [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  acquire more and more and more and more power. So we all need to remain vigilant. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  And just before we go to this quick break, I do want to give a little bit of positive news before [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1874.96s)]
*  we go to break, and that's that the SEU, California President Huerta, David Huerta, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  has been released from custody, thankfully. He still faces an unjust felony charge, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1886.96s)]
*  but he has been released and reunited with his family. And we are showing a picture [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1893.92s)]
*  right now of the moment that he was released. So at least a little bit of positivity there. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1898.48s)]
*  Ben, any final words before we go to break? I want everybody to subscribe to this YouTube [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1904.24s)]
*  channel. We're on our way to 5 million subscribers. We're about 90,000 short as of this recording. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1909.44s)]
*  So I think we're going to head there pretty quickly. So subscribe and share this YouTube [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1915.84s)]
*  channel with everybody you know. Also consider becoming a member of our YouTube channel by [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1920.3999999999999s)]

*  the fun emojis, and then we're going to start doing some membership clips. That will just be [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1931.76s)]
*  a little bit additive. I think we'll do kind of a cool series maybe with me and Filipkowski. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  We're still working on that, but you'll activate the emojis and it helps grow this independent [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1944.16s)]
*  platform. Let's take our first quick break of the show. We'll be right back after a quick message. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1949.12s)]
*  Life moves fast and sometimes you just need a way to relax, recharge, or stay focused without [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1956.96s)]
*  overcomplicating things. And that's where Viya comes in. I personally have been using Viya's [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1961.52s)]
*  night drops to help me wind down after a long day, and I'm telling you, they work. I'm sleeping [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=1965.92s)]

*  playing Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, but I don't want to, I'm all sick of him. I don't want [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2206.24s)]
*  to hear his voice that much. There's some clips that I'll still have to show, but here's the first [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2209.68s)]
*  clip I want to show. It's a MAGA Republican Congresswoman, Salazar. I believe she's from [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2215.68s)]
*  Florida's 27th congressional district. She's the daughter of Cuban refugees, a big ultra MAGA [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2221.9199999999996s)]
*  person, and she was one of these leaders. First, I think she was a newscaster, and she was [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  big Trump supporter always, and then as a congresswoman, been one of the biggest Trump [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2238.72s)]
*  supporters. She would go as a leader in the Cuban community there, and her district has little Havana [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2244.24s)]
*  and areas of Miami, and she would say, you got to support Trump. He's with us. He's never going to [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2251.8399999999997s)]
*  go after the Cubans who are not criminals. This is just about the bad guys. He's got our back. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2260.16s)]
*  He's got our back. After the election, she was interviewed by PBS, and it was a great interview [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  because the interviewer kept on pressing Congresswoman Salazar. Brett, it was your [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2276.16s)]
*  point, and the interviewer was saying, I know you're interpreting what he's saying as that he's only [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2281.6s)]
*  going to go after criminals, but he is saying that he's going to go after everybody. So why do [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2288.48s)]
*  you have this great degree of confidence? And she would be like, because I wrote the Dignity Act, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2294.96s)]
*  and he told me. He said he likes the Dignity Act. I want you to watch this clip. I am sure. Not all [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2299.52s)]
*  200,000 undocumented in your community. Is that what you're saying? I am sure that we're not, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2306.32s)]
*  that the Trump administration is not going to be targeting those people who have been here for more [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2312.32s)]
*  than five years that have American kids, that don't have criminal records, that have been working [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2316.24s)]
*  in the economy and paying taxes. I am sure that they're going to hone in on the criminals who [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2320.8799999999997s)]
*  arrived less than four years ago, because I wrote the Dignity Act, and I am the first one who [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2325.68s)]
*  understands that you have to give some type of dignity to those who have been here for more than [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2330.72s)]
*  five years. People who have roots in the country, not people who are coming to commit crimes. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2336.08s)]
*  If I can just clarify from you, have you received those kinds of details from anyone in a potential [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2341.44s)]
*  Trump administration? Because so far what we've heard is proposal for mass deportations. You have [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2347.12s)]
*  about 30 seconds left. Have you gotten those assurances? Mass deportation to those who are [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2351.76s)]
*  committing crimes who have been here for less than five years. You understand that you have millions [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2357.12s)]
*  of undocumented who are contributing with the economy and are helping our country to be a better [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2363.84s)]
*  one. The ultimate betrayal right there, right? I mean, just think about that. And she put out a [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2369.84s)]
*  statement recently over the past few days saying that she disagrees with what she strongly opposes [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2376.4s)]
*  what Donald Trump is doing towards the Cuban and Venezuelan and immigrant population. I'm fully [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2384.48s)]
*  aware and I'm heartbroken. I'm heartbroken about the uncertainty now gripping Florida's 27th [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2389.84s)]
*  District. I share your concerns. You walked your constituents into it, to a place where they're [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2396.48s)]
*  going to get deported and potentially get killed. Like you, your parents fled Castro, or if you were [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2405.6800000000003s)]
*  from Venezuela, Maduro, or the line of dictators there, Chavez, to then elect Trump, who's a [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2414.56s)]
*  worse version of them, and then your legacy will be selling out your people and saying to vote for [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2426.32s)]
*  the guy who's there to kill him. And then Iliana Garcia, she's a state senator in the similar [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2433.28s)]
*  area. She started Latinas for Trump, been a big Trump supporter since 2016. And she reiterated, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2441.2000000000003s)]
*  I stand with Congresswoman Salazar, how deeply heartbroken I am. I can't be silent. But here's [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2449.04s)]
*  the thing, those people will still support Trump. We disagree with him on this issue, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2455.76s)]
*  but on the other issues, we still think that we're Republican and we agree with those issues. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2460.0800000000004s)]
*  The issue you disagree with him is that he doesn't want you to exist. I don't know how you get to the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2466.2400000000002s)]
*  issue of being angry about a transgender volleyball player or focusing on whatever the culture war [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  issue that Fox is pushing, when the main issue is your very existence. If a politician ran, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2480.48s)]
*  when I'm in office, if your name is Ben, I'm going after you. I'm going to kill you. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2490.88s)]

*  He does make a good point though. What are you talking about? In what world does this make sense? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2504.24s)]
*  And you have to believe that because of how Donald Trump made them feel, that they felt they were [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2513.44s)]
*  different, that they thought that they could hang out at Mar-a-Lago and they would be like the white [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2519.92s)]
*  people at Mar-a-Lago, like the Afrikaners, who Trump wants to claim there's a fake white genocide. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2525.44s)]
*  There's a fake white genocide going on in South Africa and bring over. You could hang in Mar-a-Lago [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2533.04s)]
*  and that Trump would put his arm around you. No, you were a pawn. You were a puppet. Wasn't it so [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2537.6s)]
*  obvious? You were the mark. And now you've put your whole community through this and all you've [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2544.88s)]

*  even Trump. But Brett, former vice president Kamala Harris, she gave multiple speeches and then she [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2559.36s)]
*  had even like video behind her where she would show what the statements are. Let me show you [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2566.6400000000003s)]
*  this speech. I think this was October 23rd, 2024, former vice president Kamala Harris, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2571.76s)]
*  one of the speeches that she gave. It was right around that time period at least. Here, let's play. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2578.7200000000003s)]
*  Yesterday we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four star [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2582.48s)]
*  general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2587.68s)]
*  Hitler had. Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2595.04s)]
*  States Constitution. He wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2602.7999999999997s)]
*  to him personally. One that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2611.36s)]
*  abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States. In just the past week, Donald Trump [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2618.2400000000002s)]
*  has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the enemy from within and even said that he would use [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2624.56s)]
*  the United States military to go after American citizens. And let's be clear about who he considers [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2631.36s)]
*  to be the enemy from within. Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2639.6s)]
*  qualify in his mind as the enemy within. Like judges, like journalists, like nonpartisan election [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2648.88s)]
*  officials. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2658.4s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2665.44s)]
*  thousands of Americans. All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2674.48s)]
*  Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2682.56s)]
*  Let me pull up this headline right here. Here's the headline. This was written about that time [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2690.72s)]
*  when Kamala Harris said that, October 16th, 2024 in the Hill by opinion contributor Derek Hunter, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2695.68s)]

*  Kamala Harris is fear-mongering and how she is a liar for repeating what Donald Trump said at the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2709.2799999999997s)]
*  time that he would send the military after American citizens in the United States of America. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2715.92s)]
*  They called her a liar. And that's one of the issues also with this whole concept of both sides [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2720.6400000000003s)]
*  media. I know on the top of this Hill article it says that these are the expressed views by [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2725.76s)]

*  because what you do is this both sides journalism where you give credence to both sides no matter [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2736.4s)]
*  how reporting is. Just tell us the facts. Just tell us what's happening. I don't need somebody [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2742.0s)]
*  arguing with me who is arguing from a false premise. It's why I hate these CNN argument shows [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2746.0s)]
*  where they just go back and forth at each other. Sometimes things are kind of black and white. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2752.08s)]
*  And in this case, things are very black and white and now people are seeing it firsthand. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2756.88s)]
*  Brad, to your point, the CNN fight show, that's bad for the country. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2760.48s)]
*  I'm just going to say it that the fight show that airs at night is genuinely bad for the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2765.68s)]
*  country. It is brain rot to the highest level. I cannot stand that show. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2769.68s)]
*  So Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, who before being the chief of staff [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2775.2799999999997s)]
*  was a former four star general, he was a former four star general. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2785.12s)]
*  Someone with a great deal of credibility who was Trump's number one guy. He was the source [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2790.3999999999996s)]
*  that said that Donald Trump wanted Hitler generals. It didn't come from a left wing. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2798.4799999999996s)]
*  It didn't come from an anonymous source. It came from Donald Trump's former chief of staff, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2804.7999999999997s)]
*  a four star general. And it got to the point where it was a four star general. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2811.8399999999997s)]
*  And it got almost no attention. We were talking about it here. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2817.44s)]
*  Former Vice President Kamala Harris was talking about it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2821.52s)]
*  But how much more attention was the media focused on was why isn't Kamala Harris doing, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  why is she doing interviews with her vice president? Is she scared? Talking about [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2830.88s)]
*  she did a debate where she kicked Donald Trump's ass and he was too afraid to do a second debate. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2837.92s)]
*  And he was too afraid to do a second debate. Was she scared? Maybe she doesn't want to do [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2844.2400000000002s)]
*  stupid interviews with both sides of media that's shooting for a gotcha when she can just show the [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2849.0400000000004s)]
*  American people, put me on a stage next to this freaking coward and watch me whoop his ass. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2855.0400000000004s)]
*  And Trump was too afraid. Like you like that was the narrative. Why isn't she doing? He was [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2860.7200000000003s)]
*  afraid to debate her more than once because she kicked his ass. And then after Biden's debate, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2865.0400000000004s)]
*  what the media do? Oh my God, it was the worst thing ever. Trump's debate was first up, Trump [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2871.44s)]
*  was just as bad as Biden in the first debate. Let's be very clear about that. Although Biden [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2876.96s)]
*  had a terrible debate. Trump was not much better. Okay. Number two, Trump was worse in the second, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2881.84s)]
*  in the debate with Kamala that Biden was in the first debate. He talked about people eating, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2888.16s)]
*  eating cats and freaking dogs and you're eating the dogs. They're eating the dogs. They're eating [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2894.08s)]
*  the cats. And then, and then that was turned into like a song. They're eating the dogs. They're [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2899.52s)]
*  eating the cats. The guy's a crazy person. And this whole thing was freaking normalized. And we [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2904.16s)]
*  knew it all. And by the way, I can show you clips like this all the time today during a disastrous [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2909.6s)]
*  press conference by Donald Trump. He, he's talking about his military parade and then he brings up, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2914.88s)]
*  Hitler did a parade. Hitler did the parade. He was in the Eiffel tower. He always, he brings up [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2922.0s)]
*  Hitler like, like, like Hitler did a good parade here. Watch this. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2926.4s)]
*  Picking up for Russia. No, they lost 51 million people. And, you know, can't forget that. But [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2929.28s)]
*  France was celebrating. And as you know, Hitler made a speech at the Eiffel tower. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2938.0s)]
*  But when I spoke to President Macron, he said, oh, we are celebrating the great victory of World [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2944.64s)]
*  War II. And I think that's. How kind of non sequitur sentences that to begin with as well. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2949.04s)]
*  The whole thing is so ridiculous. When we get back, I want to show you the response by California. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2954.64s)]
*  And then I do want to talk about a little bit Ukraine, the disastrous budget bill. I don't want [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2959.92s)]
*  that to fall off of our radar. And so I'm going to bring it up. Let's take our last quick break [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2965.68s)]

*  maybe a little me and Ron Filipkowski. You know, just just we're trying to find creative ways to [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2987.2s)]
*  grow. I was just saying, I was just saying to Jordy, Ben's really slacking, not too nearly enough. So [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2992.24s)]
*  I really got to put this guy to work. We're like Ben has a back issue. Great. Let's make [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=2997.44s)]

*  California Governor Newsom, not one that he wanted, but he was made for this role. And we saw [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3342.8s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom stand up to Donald Trump during the wildfires. And I thought [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3349.44s)]
*  that was one of the kind of real first, I think, rallying calls. I know for our audience here, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3356.4s)]

*  was caught off guard at the degree to which the right wing during a tragedy would exploit it and [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3375.52s)]
*  just spread all this disinformation. And so with the wildfires, I think it took him about a day and [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3383.2000000000003s)]
*  a half before he really understood, wow, they're shaping the narrative in a way that's completely [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3389.04s)]
*  wrong. I don't just have to actually do what the governor's job actually is, which is to get the [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3395.44s)]
*  resources and mobilize the state like never before in a successful way. I have to equally spend my [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3401.92s)]

*  for this to happen again. And the way he's been standing up to Trump and Tom Homan, the rapid fire, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3414.8s)]
*  him pointing out when Donald Trump tried to take credit that the National Guard stopped the protests, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3422.96s)]
*  he said, first off, the National Guard hasn't even arrived yet. So you have no clue what the hell [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3430.2400000000002s)]
*  you're talking about. And then the next day when the protests continued, so now what? So now you [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3434.96s)]
*  lied and said that they stopped it. No, you've actually made things significantly worse. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3440.48s)]
*  And Governor Newsom has been pointing out all of these facts, like when these red states try to [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3445.12s)]
*  attack him and go, oh, California is a failed state, he's like, we're funding your state, moron. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3452.0s)]
*  Your state exists and hasn't gone bankrupt because of us. Oh, you want to talk about [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3458.64s)]
*  violent crime in our state? The violent crime in your state? Let's look at your stats. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3464.32s)]
*  Maybe you should go be a coach, a bad one, Tuberville. Stick to being a bad coach. You [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3470.24s)]
*  don't even know the football players who are even on your team, rather than being a senator, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3476.16s)]
*  because you have no clue what the hell you're talking about. So he's been going back and forth. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3481.68s)]
*  And then to me, this moment that I think is really defining of the past few days is, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3485.2s)]
*  you've got that guy Tom Homan. I do a Tom Homan impression. He gives Barney Rubble a really bad [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3492.0s)]
*  name. But Homan, weird dude. You know this guy is weird because his thing about AOC gets, I'm going [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3498.96s)]
*  to arrest AOC. I'm going to arrest AOC. I'm going to tell you what we're going to do. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3509.6s)]
*  We're going to arrest David Newsom today. Okay, everybody? All right, we're going to arrest you. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3517.44s)]
*  We're coming for you. And he's like evil and just like weird. I don't know if he's [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3522.48s)]
*  working on his last brain cell over there. Yeah, you're going after you. That's what we're going [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3529.2s)]
*  to do. We're going to go after everybody. It doesn't matter what you do. Do we have Tom Homan [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3533.7599999999998s)]
*  so people could just see that my impression is somewhat spot on right here? Is everyone that has [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3538.56s)]
*  been arrested by ICE agents have a criminal record like those you've described? Absolutely not. And [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3543.84s)]
*  I said from day one, January 20th, we will prioritize public safety threats and national [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3550.32s)]
*  security threats. However, we will enforce law. I may prioritize my family life over my work. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3555.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It might work. We're going to force immigration on. We've been asked about that [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3563.04s)]
*  from day one, especially in sanctuary cities. Well, we can't get the bad guy in the safety [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3567.36s)]
*  and security of a jail. They release him to the street. Well, we got to go to the street and find [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3572.2400000000002s)]
*  them. And when we find them many times with others, others are in the United States. So maybe [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3576.48s)]
*  may not be a criminal target. But guess what? If ICE is there arrest that bad guy, other [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3581.6800000000003s)]
*  illicit aliens are there. We're going to arrest them. That's what sanctuary cities get. They [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3586.0s)]
*  put us in the neighborhood. They force the neighborhood. This is what happens. Well, that [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3590.8s)]
*  Now here's what Governor Newsom had to say about that. Let's play it. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3595.4399999999996s)]
*  Axe has been here 10 years. The fear, the horror, the hell is this guy? Come after me, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3599.6s)]
*  arrest me. Let's just get it over with. Tough guy. You know, I don't give a damn, but I care [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3606.0s)]
*  about my community. I care about this community. The hell are they doing? These guys need to grow [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3612.0s)]
*  up. They need to stop. And we need to push back. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3617.3599999999997s)]
*  bloating is exhausting. So Tom, arrest me. Let's go. The perception is there's a lot of [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3623.36s)]
*  in terms of the you gov poll, the handling of Trump's deportations, 50% disapprove. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3631.92s)]
*  New poll out. I mean, this guy's the most unpopular. When you go to communities, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3641.28s)]
*  when you're in the real world and you're not, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3646.8s)]
*  no, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3648.32s)]
*  okay, when you live in the real world and you have to exist with other human beings, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3653.04s)]
*  you realize that they don't all look like you. Okay. And you realize that your neighbor who may [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  be a different ethnicity from you is actually someone who contributes and you like them. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  And these are people who you work with and you go to your school and maybe they're not the same [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3670.1600000000003s)]
*  sexual orientation as you are, but you work with people. You embrace their humanity. You [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3674.16s)]
*  respect their existence. And they're thinking, I don't think I'm Tom Homan. It's just so utterly [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3679.92s)]
*  ridiculous. And Americans don't want that shit. We don't want military parades. We don't want that [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3684.72s)]
*  crap. We don't want families being separated. We do want, go after the criminals. You have all of [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3689.6s)]
*  our support. Go after criminals, go after terrorists, go after the bad guys. Do not start ripping kids [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3695.3599999999997s)]
*  and pregnant women and hardworking. What are you doing? And people who are paying their taxes, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3703.12s)]
*  people who are showing up at court, it is utterly, utterly ridiculous. And then meanwhile, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3708.24s)]
*  I don't want to forget about the budget bill. Let me show you right here, Maga Mike Johnson, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3712.88s)]
*  talking about the budget bill. And he's like, well, we of course need to make sure we're protecting [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3717.44s)]
*  not just the billionaires, but silencers, gun silencers, the second amendment. We want to make [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3722.56s)]
*  sure there's no regulation on gun silencers. So we're going to take away your food stamps and [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3728.72s)]
*  your healthcare to 15 million Americans, but tanning beds and gun silencers, of course, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3735.2799999999997s)]
*  that's what we're focused on here. Play this clip. One, there's a provision that eliminates [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3739.9199999999996s)]
*  attacks on gun silencers. Now this is a tax that has been on the books for about a hundred years. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3745.9199999999996s)]
*  Why are you suddenly cutting attacks on silencers? Well, there's a lot of thought [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3753.9199999999996s)]
*  and deliberation that went into that as well. The second amendment is a critical freedom in [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3758.16s)]
*  the constitution. And there's no real rationale for silent, for adding taxes on these pieces of [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3762.08s)]
*  equipment. And we had the votes to do it. I think it was a long time overdue. I think we have to [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3768.64s)]
*  protect the fundamental freedoms of the American people. And there's no rationale the government [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3773.04s)]
*  should not be making money on something that you have a fundamental and alienable right to. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3777.04s)]
*  Do not forget about this disastrous budget. Okay. It's going to rip away healthcare from [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3782.08s)]
*  15 million people. It's going to literally give a thousand dollars, take it, steal it out of the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3787.36s)]
*  hands of people making under 50 K and give it to the billionaires so that they, so that people [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3793.2000000000003s)]
*  making more than $4.2 million can get what? $400,000 more like that's what they need. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3798.08s)]
*  Imagine if you took that $400,000 and you actually put it to giving people healthcare [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3806.1600000000003s)]
*  and helping people and putting people in houses. Did you imagine if that's what our focus was on? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3811.1200000000003s)]
*  And then finally, let me share this with you. This was Zelinsky in his interview this weekend, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3816.48s)]
*  where he has to again, go to the American media and say, we know that Trump's an idiot basically, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3820.7200000000003s)]
*  but we're still fighting this war and we need you here. Play this clip. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3826.64s)]
*  Has president Trump believe that Russia is winning this war? Do you think? Yes. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3829.76s)]
*  Has he told you that? I think he he's publicly sad about it. And I know that he shared this [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3837.52s)]
*  information with some people around him. And I think this operation and I said it a lot of times, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3844.24s)]
*  it's not true. It's not a victory when you spent really spent 1 million people. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3850.64s)]
*  Now, I mean, it's powerful words from Zelensky and he has taken a, you know, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3862.7999999999997s)]
*  he's taken a stand here against all the disinformation that we've been seeing from [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3867.3599999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump. It's like every, literally, quite literally every situation that we've seen, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3870.4s)]
*  Donald Trump just makes things worse over and over again, whether that's in Ukraine, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3874.56s)]
*  whether that's with these so-called trade deals that don't exist, by the way, whether it's [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3878.96s)]
*  literally name an issue. And I will say, yes, that happened again on this issue. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3885.2000000000003s)]
*  And just to go back to what Maga Mike was saying, and Ben had to run out of here to do something [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3889.52s)]
*  quickly to go back to what Maga Mike was saying before, I want to give you some updates on this [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3894.32s)]
*  GOP budget bill because the thing is still in utter chaos. So this is coming right now [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3898.64s)]
*  from Jake Sherman, who reports on the Hill. And so they haven't even sent the bill to the Senate [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3903.68s)]
*  yet for finding out. Mike Johnson has not sent that budget bill to the Senate yet. And we're [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3909.52s)]
*  seeing, you know, all this chaos surrounding this bill, all these Republican politicians [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3914.96s)]
*  that have come out against the bill. We saw Elon Musk completely blow up the bill last week. Well, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3919.2799999999997s)]
*  now we're learning that House Republicans plan to use a rule this week to make technical changes [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3924.48s)]
*  to the bill. So I think they're going to have to revote on this bill. They're going to have to go [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3929.76s)]
*  through the whole process yet again. And they're trying to figure out now, how do we appease all [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3933.52s)]
*  this very all these various factions in the Republican Party? How do we try to get this bill [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3937.84s)]
*  through? And so now they're looking at, you know, all sorts of various things right now, you know, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3944.16s)]
*  there's the issue that Marjorie Taylor Greene was upset about, which was the AI issue. There was a [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3949.04s)]
*  rule that said that states are unable to regulate AI at all for like a period of 10 years. And even [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3954.08s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene was like, that's kind of crazy to take away the rights from states to [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3960.24s)]
*  to not be able to regulate, you know, this this technology that's growing so rapidly, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3964.72s)]
*  and a whole bunch of other things. So we're going to see ultimately where that lands. But there are [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3970.16s)]
*  certainly most Republican modern day Republican Party thing, Brett, that you've witnessed, like, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3974.56s)]
*  they didn't read the bill. Is anyone read it? Like, that's why they have to go back and revote on it [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3979.92s)]
*  now. It's it's absolutely pathetic. Do your job, your job, you have the first thing, you're voting [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3984.4s)]
*  on law. What are you what are you doing? You're not reading the bill. Now we have to go back and [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3991.44s)]
*  do this whole process all over again, because you were too lazy to do what the taxpayers are paying [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=3995.76s)]
*  you to do. What are we doing? Yeah, and it's like now Republican politician after Republican [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4000.7200000000003s)]
*  politician continues to come out with a statement, Oh, I didn't actually read this portion. I didn't [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4005.52s)]
*  actually know that we're gonna that's it. That's actually your job. Okay. And if you want to blame [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4010.4s)]
*  it being rushed through whatever, well, you guys did that. So like enough is enough. Take some damn [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4014.64s)]
*  responsibility for your actions. And it's just insane. Stop making the American people the [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4019.84s)]
*  victims of your ineptitude. It's what you do every single day. And it's it's unfair to the American [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4026.24s)]
*  people. You're supposed to govern. Okay, that's why you're supposedly elected to for some reason, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4032.08s)]
*  right? So maybe do your jobs and stop trying to start shit with the American people. Stop going [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4037.2799999999997s)]
*  to war with the American people, whether it's stripping them of their health care, or whether [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4042.16s)]
*  it's sending the military onto the streets in order to spark chaos. It's not right. It's not okay. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4045.92s)]
*  This is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about. But apparently it is what it [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4051.6s)]
*  is about under this Trump administration. And it is so incredibly gross. I do want to give a shout [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4056.56s)]
*  out to Gavin Newsom for the way he's been handling this crisis. You know, he's he's really been [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4061.2s)]
*  proactive with it. And I feel like he's I would watch his moves, his communication style, and what [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4067.4399999999996s)]
*  he's been doing on digital, especially because he's been very good. And he's honestly probably the [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4073.04s)]
*  first elected politician that I've seen currently, who has been very skilled at getting ahead of the [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4078.0s)]
*  messaging, at making sure that he swats down the lies that prop up from this this MAGA cesspool [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4085.44s)]
*  online. Because as Ben was saying before, he got to get to deal with this last time too, during the [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4093.04s)]
*  fires when these MAGA people were spreading all these lies about the city. So now he's doing it [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4097.92s)]
*  again. So he has to both be a governor. And he also has to be a fact checker. And he has to be a [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4101.84s)]
*  digital media savant. And it has to be able to get out a message now quicker than other people are [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4106.64s)]
*  able to get out their messages. And as we know, lies often spread a lot quicker than the truth. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4113.04s)]
*  So like I said earlier in this episode, you know, as we go into these coming days, Trump and Hegseth, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4117.6s)]
*  and all of these people at the White House, all of these Republicans, they're going to continue to [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4123.6s)]
*  try to make things worse. They want things to get as ugly as possible. They want to see images of [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4128.24s)]
*  burning cars. They want to see images of chaos. They like those images of whether it's National [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4134.56s)]
*  Guard Marines pushing through crowds of people. They like that, right? They want to show what they [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4140.64s)]
*  think is strength. What I see it as is complete and other utter weakness. But they're going to [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4147.76s)]
*  continue to ramp this stuff up. So I want to make sure first, know your rights, know what you can do [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4152.64s)]
*  when you go to protest, know that you're right to free speech, know the things that you have to, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4158.240000000001s)]
*  and you can look all this up online, right? Know your rights, obviously remain peaceful if you're [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4162.64s)]
*  going to these protests. It's very important that you remain peaceful and, you know, show support [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4167.76s)]
*  for the folks who are out there. Show support for these communities right now that are being [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4173.04s)]
*  terrorized across the United States of America, because I could assure you it's starting right [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4178.0s)]
*  now in Los Angeles and some other pockets across the United States. It will come to your door [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4182.4800000000005s)]
*  eventually. That is Donald Trump's plan. He's going to do what authoritarians do. That is the [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4187.280000000001s)]
*  playbook. Do not be caught off guard by this. It is up to us right now to remain vigilant. It is up [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4193.04s)]
*  to us right now to combat the lies, to push back, to fight back peacefully, to quell this unrest that [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4200.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is trying to spark in our communities. And we also need to tell them, get the hell out, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4208.0s)]
*  okay? I think that's the most American thing also, right? Imaginable, right? Do you want the federal [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4213.68s)]
*  government encroaching on your space? And I never want to hear ever, ever, ever again from any of [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4218.32s)]
*  these Republicans, from any of these people who can say, oh, we're the party of small government. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4224.16s)]
*  We don't want the government in our stuff. I have never felt the government more up in my shit [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4228.08s)]
*  than right now. And by the way, also during the previous Trump administration, you know, when I [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4233.28s)]
*  really don't think about the government much, it was when Joe Biden was president and things were [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4237.92s)]
*  quietly getting done, when things were quietly getting accomplished. You know, I think people [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4242.0s)]
*  felt the government in good ways then, right? They went to the pharmacy and they paid $35 for [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4246.96s)]
*  insulin for the first time. You know, I think that's a good way to feel the government. What [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4252.4s)]
*  you don't want to do is see exactly what's going on in our cities, in our towns, in our communities, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4255.6s)]
*  in our neighbors. So I want to send my solidarity, you know, show my solidarity, you know, to all the [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4259.92s)]
*  people out there who are being terrorized right now by the Trump regime. And Jordi, do you have [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4264.4s)]
*  anything else to add as we sort of wrap up here? No, I just want to say this is a great episode, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4270.56s)]

*  fabulous. Please leave a comment. I like that. Fantabulous. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4306.5599999999995s)]
*  That was a new one. We're going to just have to keep rolling that out. Fantabulous. There we go. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4310.48s)]
*  By the way, just like in the midst of all this, you know, just to go back to some news, because I [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4314.8s)]
*  had this headline in front of me that I wanted to bring up earlier. RFK Jr. also today removed all [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4319.2s)]
*  17 members of a CDC advisory panel in his latest move to dismantle years of vaccine policy. So [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4323.92s)]
*  these are the people who advise the country on vaccine policy and on what vaccines we all need [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4330.32s)]
*  and how to proceed with vaccines and all that stuff. So that also happened in the mix. You know, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4335.36s)]
*  I know there's an impulse and I totally get it. And sometimes it's a hundred percent accurate. And [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4340.08s)]
*  I guess you can consider it, but you know, people like to say constantly, don't focus on this as a [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4343.84s)]
*  distraction. Don't focus on this as a distraction. I think one of the issues of the Trump administration [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4348.16s)]
*  and of reporting on the Trump administration is that these are actually a lot of important issues, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4354.16s)]
*  you know, before us every single day. And Trump does have a flood the zone with shit approach. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4358.8s)]
*  That comes from his, you know, 2016 run to the last administration. Steve Bannon said it out loud [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4364.08s)]
*  that their plan was to flood the zone with shit. Those were his words, right? Overwhelm the system [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4369.360000000001s)]
*  so much that people don't even have time or the ability to react. So on the one hand, sure, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4373.92s)]
*  are there distractions? Absolutely. He is the master of distraction. At the same time, there are a lot [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4379.84s)]
*  of important stuff that we need to be focused on. That's why I wanted to bring in this RFK story as [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4385.44s)]
*  well, because I don't want to want us to get in the lose sight of any of these issues in particular. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4389.36s)]
*  Right. What's happening in Los Angeles is important. What was happening between Musk and Trump, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4394.5599999999995s)]
*  also important. What's happening at the CDC, important. What's happening to social security [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4399.5199999999995s)]
*  and Medicaid and Medicare, also important. What's happening with these changes to the GOP bill, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4404.719999999999s)]
*  also important. These, it's just, we live in a world now where we're going to have to stay on, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4409.759999999999s)]
*  just keeping track of everything. So like Jordy said, I do want to thank you because just the [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4413.679999999999s)]
*  very fact that you are listening to these podcasts, that you're sharing these with friends and family, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4418.88s)]
*  you are doing such a great service. And we're so appreciative that you remain in tune because I [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4424.32s)]
*  understand, we understand, trust us, it's difficult to sometimes get up in the morning. It's difficult [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4430.639999999999s)]
*  sometimes to want to read the news, to want to watch videos about it. I totally get it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4436.72s)]
*  We live in it. We believe us. We understand. It's not easy. This is in my backyard right now. It's [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4442.96s)]
*  not easy. But I'm so proud of everybody, honestly, that you continue to use your voice, that you [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4449.12s)]
*  continue to speak out, that you just continue to do all the hard work that you all do. So let's keep [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4455.04s)]
*  pushing along. We got a big week ahead of us. I'm not going to sugarcoat things and say that this [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4461.6s)]
*  week is going to be easy. It's not going to be easy. But I can promise you that we at the Midas [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_2EceMqBI&t=4466.16s)]
