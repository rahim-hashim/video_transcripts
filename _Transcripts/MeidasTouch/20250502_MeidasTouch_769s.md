# JD Vance give HUMILIATING interview…SAYS HE’S SCARED
**MeidasTouch:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI)
*  JD Vance just sat down with Fox and gave a disastrous interview showing why he's one of the most detested, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=0.0s)]
*  if not the most detested, tied for first detested human being in the entire world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=6.16s)]
*  During this interview, JD Vance talks about how the idea of a president AOC haunts him at night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=11.6s)]
*  He's haunted by AOC. Play this clip. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=19.76s)]
*  The United States in 2028. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=22.48s)]
*  On the Democratic side, do you think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC, is the new leader? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=23.68s)]
*  Could it be Vance AOC in 2028? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  President AOC, the stuff of nightmares, Brett. Thank you. You've ruined my sleep for this evening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=34.0s)]
*  Who is the leader of the Democratic... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=38.16s)]
*  It's a weird thing, JD, for an alpha guy like you to say that AOC haunts you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=38.8s)]
*  By the way, JD Vance isn't even really his name. He's had like multiple names, multiple personalities. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=44.88s)]
*  This is the latest fraud that is JD Vance that you're seeing right here talking about [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=51.84s)]
*  being terrified of a president AOC. Then JD Vance in this disastrous interview says that the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=57.68s)]
*  real leader of the Democratic party right now is Donald J. Trump. And he says, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=64.4s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=69.44s)]
*  No, honestly, I think... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=71.6s)]
*  Do you think about it? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=72.64s)]
*  I think to the extent the Democrats have a leader, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=73.76s)]
*  Donald J. Trump is the leader of the Democratic party. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=76.4s)]
*  It goes against him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=78.64s)]
*  Because they're just against everything that he does. I mean, who could possibly disagree [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=79.28s)]
*  with rebuilding American manufacturing and ensuring these steelworkers have higher wages [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  and better jobs? But anytime Donald Trump does anything, they have this emotional response. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=87.6s)]
*  They have to be against it. Who could disagree with deporting millions of illegal aliens, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  many of whom are violent criminals, but they do. They have. And I think that what they do is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  whenever Donald J. Trump does something, they react negatively to it. They don't have real [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  leadership. And I think that's why I'm not too concerned about 2028. Because if I wake up in a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=108.08s)]
*  fantasy world... [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=114.16s)]
*  He says Donald J. Trump. This guy is so utterly pathetic. Then to Brett Baer's credit, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=114.88s)]
*  very little credit, but to his credit here, he goes and asks JD Vance, you know, like you and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=123.28s)]
*  Donald Trump have a very low approval rating right now. What's your response to the fact that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=127.92s)]
*  Americans just don't seem to like you? What do you think the response is? Fake news, fake news. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=133.28s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=138.72s)]
*  He talks about polls and he's not a fan of how the polls are done. But the approval ratings for you, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=139.68s)]
*  for the president, if you look at the polls, not just one, but a span of them, you know, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=146.72s)]
*  are not great 100 days in. They're great on border security, but on the economy and overall approval, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=152.24s)]
*  it's a little underwater. And how do you look at that? What do you think that is from? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm a firm believer, Brett, that in the modern era, in 2025, opinion pollsters just don't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=164.72s)]
*  know how to capture most Americans. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=171.52s)]
*  And here, Brett Baer asks JD Vance, do you think Donald Trump's going to be running in 2028? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=173.44s)]
*  And rather than say no, that would be unlawful. JD Vance, you know, thinks it's funny to talk [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=180.96s)]
*  about dictatorship. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see what happens in 2028. Here, play this clip. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=187.04s)]
*  So while JD Vance was doing that interview on Fox, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump announced to the press that he was holding a press conference. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=220.16s)]
*  And instead of actually speaking at the press conference, Donald Trump showed cartoons. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's cartoons of himself sleeping. Like, look at this. It's cartoons of Donald Trump sleeping. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=231.12s)]
*  And it says, promises made, promises kept. And then this is like, this was the press conference [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=237.68s)]
*  that they held in the White House. I mean, how pathetic can you get here? And it says, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  ending inflation, America is now affordable again. It says, the promise made, Donald Trump made the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=247.44s)]
*  promise in Pennsylvania, August 17, 2024, starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. Again. Then it says, promises [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=260.88s)]
*  kept. The White House has delivered emergency price relief for American families and it defeated the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=266.96s)]
*  cost of living crisis. It says, it's done. We're winning. We're winning. There's no more inflation, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=273.44s)]
*  they say right here. Oh, and then here, Donald Trump posted another cartoon again. He's sleeping [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=279.2s)]
*  in the photo. And then it says, restoring freedom of speech. Donald Trump promised January 19th, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=284.32s)]
*  I will restore freedom of speech. And then it says, promises kept. Now freedom of speech has been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=290.96s)]
*  restored by ending federal censorship. Literally the Trump regime goes around and attacks law firms, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=297.68s)]
*  universities, people, speaker. I mean, you know, all the attacking AOC, attacking everybody from free [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=307.04s)]
*  speech. I mean, this regime is dastardly and all they do is lie over and over again. I want to show [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  you this next clip of JD Vance though, just to show you who JD Vance really is. But I do want to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=322.8s)]
*  give a shout out to Ground News. And that's how I research things here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=328.08s)]
*  I often get asked, hey Ben, what research tools do you use to, you know, find out what the right [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=334.72s)]
*  wing's talking about or just what maybe we don't know is being reported that we should focus on? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=340.48s)]
*  I use Ground News and they've got this incredible feature called Blind Spot where I could see, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=346.88s)]
*  all the right wing media is focused on this and no left wing media is focused on it. What's going on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=352.96s)]
*  here? And so like a typical example I'll just give you, like while all of this is taking place, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=359.12s)]
*  is that you have the Trump regime, Stephen Miller and others, criticized media during White House [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=364.08s)]
*  press conference. Like all the right wing media talks about that and like no left wing media talks [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  about that. Because like that's their whole thing. We own the media, we own the libs versus actually [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=375.2s)]
*  getting things done. By the way, I think Ground News is essential to see through any double [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=380.0s)]
*  standards in the current media ecosphere. Go to ground.news.mtn, scan the QR code. We're giving [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=385.12s)]
*  our viewers 40% off Ground News' top tier vantage plan, which will get you unlimited access to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=392.48s)]
*  everything I've shown you and more. Ground News is subscriber funded so they don't rely on ads. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  That could also introduce bias. Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=404.8s)]
*  working to keep the media transparent. Again, go to ground.news.mtn, ground.news.mtn. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=410.32s)]
*  Here's the clip I wanted to show you of JD Vance. This is from like six years ago. Like this isn't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=420.16s)]
*  like 20 years ago. JD Vance used to be the biggest Never Trumper that there was. Just listen to what [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  JD Vance has to say. Play this clip. I'm a Never Trump guy. I never liked him. It makes you think [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=431.92s)]
*  that at a fundamental level, this is sort of a he said, she said, right. And at the end of the day, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=437.6s)]
*  do you believe Donald Trump who always tells the truth? Just kidding. Or do you believe that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=442.72s)]
*  woman on that team? I cannot stand Trump because I think he's a fraud. Well, I think he's a total [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=447.04s)]
*  fraud that is exploiting these people who is a total fraud. Like you said, I agree with you on [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=452.24s)]
*  Trump because I don't think that he's the person. I don't think he actually cares about folks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  There is definitely an element of Donald Trump's support that has its basis in racism, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  or xenophobia. I think there's a chance if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=466.48s)]
*  that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton. I think that I'm going to vote [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=472.72s)]
*  for, I'm going to vote third party because I can't stomach Trump. I think that he's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=478.24s)]
*  noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place. And by the way, this was, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=482.8s)]
*  what, two days ago when JD Vance was in that cabinet meeting. And he said, and this is how [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=488.96s)]
*  we got to where he is in the Trump regime. He looks at all of the portraits that are in the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  cabinet room and he's like, look at all these presidents, Donald. They're not real men. You're [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=502.08s)]
*  a real man. These are placeholders for you to step up. Here, watch this. I think what it shows to me [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=507.12s)]
*  is that the president, and you sit in the Oval Office and you see these portraits of presidents [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=514.24s)]
*  passed. And let's be honest, most of them have been placeholders. They've been people who have [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=518.32s)]
*  allowed their staff to sign executive orders with an auto pen instead of men of action. And the reason [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  the media attacks this administration as chaotic is because the president is solving the problems [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=531.2s)]
*  the American people set about to solve. He's actually doing the things that he promised that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=538.0s)]
*  he would do. And Mr. President, it's been an honor to be part of it for the past 100 days. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, JD, I'm here and ready to haunt your dreams right now. May I introduce AOC taking the stage at [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=547.52s)]
*  Jackson Heights in New York, the largest town hall they've held there ever. Play this clip. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=556.0s)]
*  And here is what AOC has to say about Tom Homan, the quote, unquote, border czar of the Trump regime. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=561.04s)]
*  Play this clip right here. And when we first did one of these seminars, Tom Homan, then acting [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=584.88s)]
*  director of ICE, said that he was going to threaten to refer me to DOJ because I'm using my free speech [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=591.04s)]
*  rights in order to advise people of their constitutionally guaranteed protections. And [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=598.48s)]
*  he may want to do it again today. And so that I say, come for me. You're going to have to come for me. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=604.32s)]
*  Do I look like I care? Because we the way that we guarantee in this moment, when people say, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=615.28s)]
*  how do we protect against everything that's going on? How do we make sure that we can, what can we do [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=623.68s)]
*  to prevent this erosion, all this stuff that's happening? We do it by exercising and using our [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=630.72s)]
*  constitutional rights. Our rights are use it or lose it. So we need to use it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=636.64s)]
*  And we need to challenge them. So don't let them intimidate you into thinking that you're doing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=644.88s)]
*  something wrong by telling people what their actual legal constitutional rights are. There's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_nveg6K2WI&t=650.64s)]
