# Trump has WORST DAY of HIS LIFE as No Kings CRUSHES HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog)
*  That was a ballistic missile sent by Iran, striking the center of Tel Aviv as the war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=0.0s)]
*  between Israel and Iran intensifies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=11.92s)]
*  While the Middle East is engulfed in all-out war, what was Donald Trump doing yesterday? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=15.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was holding a dictator parade for himself on his birthday, co-opting the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=21.52s)]
*  250th anniversary of the United States Army. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=27.76s)]
*  Donald Trump was on stage with the former Fox Weekend news host Pete Hegseth and the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=32.32s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=40.08s)]
*  They promised there would be 250,000 people who were going to be there in Washington, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=43.52s)]
*  D.C. for this dictator parade. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=48.8s)]
*  It seemed like less than 10,000 people showed up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=50.8s)]
*  It was an embarrassing event. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=54.46s)]
*  Donald Trump was sulking the entire time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=56.52s)]
*  And while you had that disastrous dictator day parade event, throughout the United States [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  there were massive no-kings protests in blue states, in red states, in purple states, in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=66.72s)]
*  big cities, in medium-sized cities, in small cities, in small towns, in medium-sized towns. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=75.12s)]
*  Over five million people in America at least showed up for the no-kings protests to protest [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=82.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's dictatorial actions and say no to tyrants, no to kings. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=89.92s)]
*  The split screen between, on the one hand, all of the pro-democracy protesters protesting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump on one screen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=103.68s)]
*  On the other screen, Donald Trump's disastrous dictator parade, where less than 10,000 people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  showed up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=111.98s)]
*  Empty seats, low energy, Donald Trump sulking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=112.98s)]
*  And then on another screen, war in the Middle East, Israel demanding that the United States [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  join the war efforts officially against Iran because Israel needs these bunker-busting [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=124.58s)]
*  bombs to reach one of Iran's nuclear facilities that it can't reach on its own. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=131.66s)]
*  Of course, you have the United States right now providing unofficial support to Israel [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=137.64s)]
*  through weapons and through other logistics in the war against Iran, although Donald Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  was out there over the past 48 hours basically taking credit for everything and trying to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=149.88s)]
*  escalate things in the Middle East. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=154.77999999999997s)]
*  And so while all of this was taking place, you have Trump's communication director just [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=157.04s)]
*  spreading the most ridiculous and humiliating lies for the regime. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=162.33999999999997s)]
*  Stephen Chung, Donald Trump's communications director, posted the following at approximately [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=167.16s)]
*  6.55 p.m. last night. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=173.32s)]
*  He goes, amazing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=175.72s)]
*  Despite the threat of rain, over 250,000 patriots showed up to celebrate the 250th anniversary [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=177.44s)]
*  of the U.S. Army. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=186.2s)]
*  God bless the USA. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=187.92s)]
*  We responded from the official Midas Touch account by saying, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=190.46s)]
*  catches breath, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=197.58s)]
*  That couldn't be further from the truth, what Stephen Chung was saying there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  Don't worry, we'll show you receipts in just a moment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  Stephen Chung also posted the following at 5.41 p.m. yesterday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=207.9s)]
*  The so-called no-kings protests have been a complete and utter failure with minuscule [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=213.74s)]
*  attendance. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  Sad Democrats and liberals would rather support criminals and illegals instead of celebrating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=220.1s)]
*  the 250th anniversary of our great U.S. Army and Flag Day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=226.14s)]
*  But many more Americans are commemorating our brave military men and women who have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=231.18s)]
*  given the ultimate sacrifice and who those continue to serve our country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=236.1s)]
*  See, it's all projection and confession with people like Stephen Chung. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  The reality is the failure and minuscule attendance was at Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=245.48s)]
*  The support of criminals and illegals is referring to Donald Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=252.32s)]
*  Donald Trump is a felon who engages in illegal conduct all the time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=257.2s)]
*  Trump is a sexual abuser. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=262.2s)]
*  He is a bankruptor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  And he co-opted and took over what should have just been an event for the United States [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=265.92s)]
*  Army not through massive tanks rolling into Washington, D.C. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=271.64s)]
*  But there could have been a right way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=275.96s)]
*  And I think actually it could have been a popular event if Donald Trump didn't turn [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  it into a dictator parade and make it about himself and make it about his birthday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=285.96s)]
*  And then when Stephen Chung goes, but many more Americans are commemorating our brave [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  military men and women, let's be clear, we should commemorate our brave military men [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=296.98s)]
*  and women. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=302.3s)]
*  But that's not what Donald Trump was doing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump was turning the event about his own dictatorial power and he was doing a very [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=305.26s)]
*  bad job at it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=310.38s)]
*  Where people were showing up to in the millions and millions and millions, somewhere between [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=312.66s)]
*  five and 10 million were the no-kings protests. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=317.12s)]
*  So let me just take out the receipts right here, shall we? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=319.74s)]
*  And let's just go over it together. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=322.54s)]
*  I want to show you this clip right here of you'll see some of the troops marching in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=325.02s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=330.3s)]
*  And you'll see the empty seats behind them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=331.98s)]
*  And you'll see just how low energy it is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=335.34s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=337.66s)]
*  As Doug Landry says, take a look at this poor soldier who is being forced by the Trump [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=338.7s)]
*  regime to serve as a crowd advance guy with the small group of people who actually ended [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  up showing up to this Trump dictator parade here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=365.62s)]

*  One of the interesting things was a speech that was given by J.D. Vance at this disastrous [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=498.70000000000005s)]
*  dictator parade for Donald Trump, where Vance says, we never ask you to go to war unless [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=503.82s)]
*  you absolutely have to. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=509.9s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  And so to our soldiers, we're so proud of you and let me tell you that the way that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=512.42s)]
*  we honor and respect you is, number one, we never ask you to go to war unless you absolutely [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=517.3s)]
*  have to. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=523.6s)]
*  And number two, when we do ask you to go to war, we give you the weapons and the support [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=524.6s)]
*  needed to kick the hell out of the enemy and come back home safely. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=529.26s)]
*  And notably, J.D. Vance was saying that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=535.9s)]
*  At the same time, Israel officially requested the United States to join its ongoing war [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=538.26s)]
*  against Iran, particularly targeting the underground nuclear facilities such as the Fordo fuel [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=543.74s)]
*  enrichment plant, which the Israeli Air Force does not have the means to effectively strike [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=549.14s)]
*  without the United States bunker busting bomb. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=553.84s)]
*  So it seems like Donald Trump is indeed dragging the United States and our troops into another [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  Middle East war. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=562.74s)]
*  And didn't Donald Trump say that he had the secret that he was going to keep America out [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=564.06s)]
*  of World War III? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=568.6199999999999s)]
*  No, you were bringing America into World War III. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=569.6199999999999s)]
*  You also promised that you were going to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=571.9799999999999s)]
*  But one of your main posts yesterday was bragging about Vladimir Putin giving you a call. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump posted yesterday, President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=582.9399999999999s)]
*  should be a happy birthday, but to more importantly talk about Iran, a country he knows very well. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=589.06s)]
*  We talked at length. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=595.02s)]
*  Much less time was spent talking about Russia, Ukraine. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=596.0999999999999s)]
*  But that will be for next week. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=599.26s)]
*  He is doing the planned prisoner swaps. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=600.8199999999999s)]
*  Large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged immediately from both sides. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=603.54s)]
*  The call lasted approximately one hour. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  He feels, as do I, this war in Israel, Iran should end, to which I explained his war should [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=609.38s)]
*  also end. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=616.8s)]
*  Donald Trump getting advice about what the United States should be doing in Iran from [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=618.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=624.68s)]
*  And then shortly thereafter, you can't make this stuff up. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=626.24s)]
*  The Department of Defense posted a happy flag day image. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  And on the happy flag day image, look at that flag right there under flag day. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=634.42s)]
*  Does that look familiar to you? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=639.16s)]
*  Because that ain't the US flag right there. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=641.0s)]
*  That's the flag of Russia that the Department of Defense posted right there. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=643.64s)]
*  How utterly embarrassing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=650.12s)]
*  You take a look right here, another photo of the empty stands for Trump's military birthday [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=651.68s)]
*  parade. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, now let's contrast that to what's going on with the No Kings protests. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  We could evaluate if what Stephen Chung was saying is truthful or not truthful. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=663.68s)]
*  Let's just pick a random city, a great city, but let's just pick anyone at random. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=668.16s)]
*  Boise, Idaho showing up for No Kings. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=672.5999999999999s)]
*  Take a look right there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=675.88s)]
*  How about Chicago? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=677.16s)]
*  How about San Diego? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  How about Los Angeles? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=680.4599999999999s)]
*  How about in New York? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=682.04s)]
*  As I said from the outset, big cities, small cities, medium-sized cities, big towns, small [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  towns, red states, blue states, purple states, people showed up. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=689.28s)]
*  In contrast, people did not show up to Donald Trump's dictator parade. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=694.64s)]
*  Look at Secretary of State Marco Rubio just sitting there, bored out of his mind, looking [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=698.84s)]
*  miserable as war rages in the Middle East. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=704.88s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=709.2800000000001s)]
*  Here's another photo coming from Trump's birthday parade. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=720.6s)]
*  You can see from this angle as well. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=723.88s)]
*  No one showed up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=725.84s)]
*  Let's compare and contrast that photo to even just say Boise, Idaho. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=726.84s)]
*  Far more people showed up in Boise, Idaho than showed up for Donald Trump's dictator [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  parade. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  Yesterday was also a very tragic day, though. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=739.32s)]
*  There was the assassination of a house, of a state representative in Minnesota, and an [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  assassination attempt on the life of a state senator in Minnesota. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=750.64s)]
*  You had all of the right-wing out there trying to spread these dastardly and despicable rumors [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=755.74s)]
*  that the assassin, who we learned to be someone by the name of Vance Bolter, they were trying [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  to act like this guy was a Democrat and he was close with Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  They spread that disinformation. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=777.66s)]
*  Elon Musk amplified it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=779.74s)]
*  The New York Post spread that information. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=782.1s)]
*  When you read the New York Post article, one of the first hints that this guy was actually [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=784.06s)]
*  not a Democrat is if you went to about paragraph 30, it says, despite serving under Dems, Bolter [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=788.6199999999999s)]
*  last registered to vote in 2022 as a Republican. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=796.5799999999999s)]
*  The only reason he served under Dems is because he was selected in a prior administration [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  and his service rolled over into the Democratic administration. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=805.7399999999999s)]
*  But this was a registered Republican who had a list of Democrats and pro-choice people. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=809.76s)]
*  And the reason that he had information about no kings is he was going after Democrats and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=816.68s)]
*  pro-democracy people. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=822.64s)]
*  This was a right-wing extremist nutcase whose views were similar to a Timothy McVeigh. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=824.28s)]
*  He was an extremist, radicalized, anti-abortion, anti-LGBT, pro-homeschooling type of extremist [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=830.72s)]
*  right-wing person. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=842.54s)]
*  And then we got the local news who tracked it down and it was clear that the Minnesota [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=844.02s)]
*  assassin was a big Donald Trump supporter after they spread all of these lies. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=849.64s)]
*  Here's what they talked about on the local news. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=855.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=857.5600000000001s)]
*  We even asked about Mr. Bolter's political affiliations and David Carlson, once again [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=858.56s)]
*  his roommate and best friend, known him since fourth grade, did say Bolter voted for Trump [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=865.56s)]
*  and that he was a strong supporter. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=871.3599999999999s)]
*  As we wrote on the Midas Touch account, remember this moment, everybody. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=874.0999999999999s)]
*  Remember all the people who lied in the morning to try to spread false narratives that this [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=878.66s)]
*  was, that the assassin was a Democrat. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=884.0s)]
*  There was a Democratic assassin going after all the Democrats out there. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=886.82s)]
*  Elon must amplify that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=890.86s)]
*  And as we say in the Midas Touch account, these are bad actors, these are horrible human [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=892.98s)]
*  beings. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=897.38s)]
*  Never trust them again. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=898.38s)]
*  And it's people like Stephen Chung and others constantly lie, lie, lie, lie, lie. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=899.38s)]
*  It's one of the things that's so important about independent media, what we're building [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=905.6s)]
*  here at the Midas Touch Network and what we're encouraging others to build this vibrant, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=910.7s)]
*  independent media ecosystem to get out the truth. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=916.86s)]
*  Here's a photo of me and my wife and our eight month old daughter. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=920.1s)]
*  I love the sign that we made for her. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=924.0600000000001s)]
*  I love naps, but I stay woke. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=926.1s)]
*  There was my sign, due process for all. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=928.62s)]
*  My wife signed liberty and justice for all. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=930.5s)]
*  We attended the Pasadena No Kings protests. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  It was an incredible event to be at with the family. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=938.12s)]
*  I saw so many Midas Mighty out there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=940.74s)]
*  I saw so many people with Midas Mighty signs at the No Kings protests across the United [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=948.5s)]
*  It was so cool to see all of that and to also see the impact that this network is having [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=949.5s)]
*  on everybody, bringing out the truth, getting out accurate information, and ensuring that [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=955.3399999999999s)]
*  all of this disinformation that's spread by bad actors on the right, but then that's amplified [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=962.9s)]
*  by corporate news and state regime media that we build the infrastructure to combat that [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=969.7s)]
*  together. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJLfdHdxPog&t=975.7s)]
