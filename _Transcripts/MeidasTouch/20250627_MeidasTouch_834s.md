# SICKLY Trump KILLS His OWN Term and SPIRALS IN PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI)
*  So utterly pathetic and desperate. All throughout the night Donald Trump was posting photos of himself with messages from GOP Congress members, each one trying to outdo the next, saying, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. And then it's a photo of Donald Trump, and he keeps on reposting these things. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=14.5s)]
*  I don't know, how about you do what you said you were going to do in the campaign? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=21.5s)]
*  Make housing more affordable. End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, which you now say, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's just too complicated to do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=25.0s)]
*  Stop inflation because inflation is rising. And by the way, the economy for the first quarter was just revised downward to negative point five percent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=34.0s)]
*  And it does seem at least to 70 percent of Americans that we're heading into a recession. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=45.5s)]
*  A lot of Americans feel that way now, but keep posting photos of yourself in that bordello. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=52.0s)]
*  That's what looks like a bordello, that oval office with all the things painted gold saying that you should get a Nobel Peace Prize. It's so ridiculous. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=57.5s)]
*  Then on Trump's social media platform, he sells ads that are like this in between his posts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=66.0s)]
*  Should the no-kings rioters be arrested? Yes or no. Go to Patriot Addict. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=73.5s)]
*  The no-kings rioter. Who are the no-kings rioters? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=80.5s)]
*  What I do remember is that you had a very low energy, pathetic and very much low attended dictator parade. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=83.5s)]
*  And the no-kings protests had millions of people and were peaceful. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=93.5s)]
*  Close to three percent of the population protested you. But OK, that's what you want to spend your time doing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=97.5s)]
*  Then Donald Trump reposts Tom Homan. The borders are. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=104.0s)]
*  The big beautiful bill should be nonpartisan. If we get this bill passed, we got more agents on the road. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what Americans really want, Trump and Tom Homan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=115.0s)]
*  More masked ICE agents, militarized, attacking Home Depot parking lots and restaurants [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=118.5s)]
*  and hardworking vendors on the side of the road and going into factories and waiting inside courtrooms with people who are lawfully pursuing legal process. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=129.5s)]
*  Most of the people who you're out there attacking have no criminal record. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=142.5s)]
*  But that doesn't matter. You're treating all migrants as though they're basically criminals and terrorists. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=146.5s)]
*  And you are terrorizing the streets with ICE agents. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=152.5s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts, The Democrats are the ones who leaked the information on the perfect flight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=156.5s)]
*  And he puts that in caps to the nuclear sites in Iran. They should be prosecuted. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=162.5s)]
*  Well, also, if it's so perfect, why were you excluding your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, from all congressional briefings? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=168.5s)]
*  You're head of intelligence. You've banned from the intelligence meetings on a bipartisan basis with Congress. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=179.5s)]
*  That's never happened before. And so now what? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=188.5s)]
*  You want to use the fact that our military analysis, our damage assessment from the Pentagon, as well as CENTCOM, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=191.5s)]
*  as well as the European analysis says that the nuclear facilities were not destroyed and Iran was able to move out the uranium. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=200.5s)]
*  Now you want to use the leak as a way to what? Prosecute all Democrats, go after everybody. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=208.5s)]
*  They should all be prosecuted. Again, you're just a dictator. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=214.5s)]
*  You're a pathetic clown of a dictator. And you're weak. You're weak. And Americans see your weakness. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=218.5s)]
*  The world sees your weakness. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=228.5s)]
*  Here's another poll that Donald Trump posts as an advertisement on his social media site. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=230.5s)]
*  Should Trump officially stop supporting Pride Month? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=237.5s)]
*  The hell are you talking about? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=241.5s)]
*  You know, one of the other things that Donald Trump says is like, we're trying to stop transgender for everyone. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=243.5s)]
*  That's what we're focused on. You leave your house, you become transgender. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=249.5s)]
*  Like, I don't know what y'all MAGA Republicans think happens in the world that you walk outside and all of a sudden you become transgender. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=253.5s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=262.5s)]
*  Stop bullying marginalized communities. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=263.5s)]
*  Can you stop doing that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=267.5s)]
*  And can you focus on the issues that matter to the American people? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=269.5s)]
*  Housing, making housing affordable so people can pay their rent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=272.5s)]
*  Let's stop people having to live paycheck to paycheck and endure the psychological torture. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=277.5s)]
*  When people are working a job, they shouldn't have to worry that they can't afford food or rent or their mortgage [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=284.5s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=291.5s)]
*  And I think about the contrast between Americans who can't get the health care they need, the education they need, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=293.5s)]
*  the housing they need, the food that they need to what? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=299.5s)]
*  Trump's billionaire friends like Jeff Bezos getting married in Venice. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=304.5s)]
*  They were having foam parties out on Bezos massive yacht that's $500 million. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=309.5s)]
*  And you see that image of Bezos having a foam party on the yacht. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=316.5s)]
*  That's like where you like dance in foam, I guess, on the yacht with his new wife and his stepson. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=321.5s)]
*  And so his stepson's playing in foam with Bezos. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=329.5s)]
*  His Bezos is dancing with his mom in a bikini. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=333.5s)]
*  And they're out there all partying and the Kardashians are flying in and everybody's spending $1 million [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=336.5s)]
*  and living their lavish lifestyles out in Venice and flaunting it in everybody's faces while Americans are struggling. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=342.5s)]
*  And that's screwed up. That's screwed up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=349.5s)]
*  And what I said should be a bipartisan issue. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=352.5s)]
*  We should be fighting for all Americans, not this crap right here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=355.5s)]
*  And just think about what was Donald Trump's promises. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=359.5s)]
*  He would stop inflation on day one. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=361.5s)]
*  He would make housing affordable. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=364.5s)]
*  He would stop the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=366.5s)]
*  Although now when it comes to Ukraine, as you know, what does he say? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=368.5s)]
*  He says he was being sarcastic when he said that he would end the war 24 hours. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=371.5s)]
*  He never actually meant that seriously. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=376.5s)]
*  That's what he's saying now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=379.5s)]
*  And now he wants a Nobel Peace Prize for being the cause and the arsonist of wars throughout the world. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=380.5s)]
*  That's what he thinks. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=388.5s)]
*  That if he partially puts out the fire he creates, he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=389.5s)]
*  Never has the world in recent years become more unstable than with what Donald Trump has created. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=394.5s)]
*  Donald Trump posts the following in all caps. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=402.5s)]
*  Fake news reporters from CNN and the New York Times should be fired immediately. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=405.5s)]
*  Bad people with evil intentions. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=409.5s)]
*  You know, when he posts that, it's all kind of projection and confession about himself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=412.5s)]
*  And then, you know, he gave that bizarre press conference yesterday, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=416.5s)]
*  the one where he claimed that there was a deal that he signed with China. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=420.5s)]
*  And then like the media reports that like there was a real deal with China. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=425.5s)]
*  Right, Trump goes, we did this great deal with China, right, guys? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=429.5s)]
*  Yesterday we did a deal with China. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=432.5s)]
*  So that would be Wednesday. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=434.5s)]
*  You mean you did a deal with China? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=435.5s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=437.5s)]
*  What deal are you referring to? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=439.5s)]
*  You did a trade deal, thousands of pages, with China? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=440.5s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=444.5s)]
*  Making this up, everything out of this fraud, this criminal's mouth, this sexual abuser's mouth is a lie. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=445.5s)]
*  Here's what he said about China. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=453.5s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=455.5s)]
*  Everybody wants to make a deal and have a part of it, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=456.5s)]
*  I know you and Howard and Scott are working overtime making deals with other countries. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=461.5s)]
*  You remember a few months ago, the press was saying, do you really have anybody of any interest? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=468.5s)]
*  Well, we just signed with China yesterday, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=473.5s)]
*  Just signed with China. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=476.5s)]
*  We have everybody. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=477.5s)]
*  We're not going to make deals with everybody. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=479.5s)]
*  Some were just going to send them a letter, say thank you very much. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=480.5s)]
*  You're going to pay 25, 35, 45 percent. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=483.5s)]
*  That's the easy way to do it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=486.5s)]
*  And my people don't want to do it that way. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=487.5s)]
*  They want to do some of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=489.5s)]
*  But we're having some great deals. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=492.5s)]
*  We have one coming up, maybe with India, very big one. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=494.5s)]
*  Well, we're going to open up India. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=497.5s)]
*  Then he refers to his governance as being a ruler. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=499.5s)]
*  I've ruled this way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=503.5s)]
*  I've ruled to stop the transgenders for everybody. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=505.5s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=509.5s)]
*  What does that even mean, transgender for everybody? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=511.5s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=514.5s)]
*  But no matter what you are, it's all about common sense. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=515.5s)]
*  And I think that's the way I've ruled. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=519.5s)]
*  I do what's right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=520.5s)]
*  I want to have borders. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=521.5s)]
*  I don't want to have transgender for anybody that happens to leave the house at a young age, the things they do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=522.5s)]
*  And then in a very creepy way, he starts to call the people around him pretty. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=529.5s)]
*  He's like, where's Angelina? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=534.5s)]
*  You're so pretty, Angelina. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=536.5s)]
*  You're so pretty. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=538.5s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=539.5s)]
*  Angelina Banks from Philadelphia. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=540.5s)]
*  Where's Angelina? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=542.5s)]
*  Where's Angelina? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=543.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=545.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=546.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=547.5s)]
*  Is that your mother? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=548.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=551.5s)]
*  You are very pretty. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=552.5s)]
*  And then he complains that he really wants to call waitresses pretty, but it's politically incorrect to call waitresses pretty now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=555.5s)]
*  I will never say good-looking waitress because looks don't matter anymore, you know, in our modern society. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=563.5s)]
*  She happened to be beautiful, but I won't say that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=568.5s)]
*  What are they talking about? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=572.5s)]
*  A new poll came out from Quinnipiac about the disastrous budget bill. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=574.5s)]
*  I guess that's what Trump was supposed to be doing at that press conference. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=578.5s)]
*  Only 29% of Americans support this disastrous budget bill. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=582.5s)]
*  It is wildly and deeply unpopular. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=586.5s)]
*  And you know from my reporting yesterday that a lot of the provisions have had to be stricken from the budget bill because the MAGA Republicans tried to pretend that these provisions could go in a reconciliation bill. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=588.5s)]
*  And the parliamentarian ruled that they can't go into the bill. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=603.5s)]
*  So the Senate's trying to figure out what it does next. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=607.5s)]
*  Also, the White House is signaling that the July 9th trade deadline, remember 90 deals in 90 days, may be extended. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=611.5s)]
*  The White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, said the July 9th trade deadline is flexible and could be extended. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=619.5s)]
*  Trump may impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that don't reach deals by then, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=626.5s)]
*  but could also offer terms unilaterally. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=631.5s)]
*  Offering terms unilaterally is not a deal. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=633.5s)]
*  So far, only a deal with the UK and a truce with China have been reached with other talks ongoing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=637.5s)]
*  How many a truce with China? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=645.5s)]
*  You mean Donald Trump imposed 145% tariffs on China and then withdrew it to basically 55%? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=647.5s)]
*  And China said that it will revisit every six months whether or not to supply critical minerals to the United States when the United States had that supply before. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=655.5s)]
*  And now China is asking United States businesses to give proprietary information if they want the critical minerals that China can then use to basically steal the intellectual property from United States corporations. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=666.5s)]
*  Great deal, Donald. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=678.5s)]
*  What a wise dealmaker you are. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=680.5s)]
*  What was the UK deal that certain UK automobile manufacturers like Rolls Royce and Land Rover and Jaguar get preferential treatment over United States manufacturers who were tariffed higher because they have factories in Canada and Mexico? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=683.5s)]
*  Oh, what a big deal. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=700.5s)]
*  And it's not a trade deal. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=702.5s)]
*  You addressed automobiles and airplanes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=704.5s)]
*  That's not a trade deal. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=708.5s)]
*  And as Peter Schiff writes, and he's accurate here on this point, he goes, tariffs aren't working. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=710.5s)]
*  The US trade, talk about data, the US trade deficit in goods surged to 96.6 billion in May, up 11% from April and 6.5% above expectations. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=715.5s)]
*  Most problematic was the 5.2% decline in exports. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=727.5s)]
*  Trump's goal to reduce trade tariffs while expanding markets for US exports has backfired. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=732.5s)]
*  So what's Trump doing with all of this now? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=739.5s)]
*  He's selling daddy merch. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=741.5s)]
*  It's a photo of him and it says daddy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=743.5s)]
*  He's actually selling this to the MAGA supporters. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=745.5s)]
*  You can wear Trump on your shirt and have it say daddy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=748.5s)]
*  I mean, that's really pathetic stuff. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=752.5s)]
*  That's not normal. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=754.5s)]
*  And again, I understand that Trump's approval rating is what right now? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=755.5s)]
*  It's like in the 30s, low 40s, depending on which poll you look at, but like 38%, 39%. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=759.5s)]
*  This is weird stuff. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=767.5s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=769.5s)]
*  And as I said, I'll tell you what Americans want. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=771.5s)]
*  Affordable housing, affordable housing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=774.5s)]
*  They want to be able to easily pay their mortgage and rent if they're working. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=776.5s)]
*  They don't want to live paycheck to paycheck. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=779.5s)]
*  The woman's reproductive rights should be protected. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=781.5s)]
*  Health care should be provided to all Americans. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=784.5s)]
*  It's a right. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=787.5s)]
*  Education should be provided to all Americans. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=788.5s)]
*  It is a right. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=791.5s)]
*  So we should be talking about. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=793.5s)]
*  And when Trump goes, oh, my gas prices are 198. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=795.5s)]
*  I brought him down to 198. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=799.5s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=801.5s)]
*  Lies. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=802.5s)]
*  They're all lies. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=803.5s)]
*  All lies. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=804.5s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlPwjPyQtI&t=805.5s)]
