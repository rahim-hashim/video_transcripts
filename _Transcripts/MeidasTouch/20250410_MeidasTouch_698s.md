# Republicans LOSE THEIR MINDS over Trump MARKET DISASTER
**MeidasTouch:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64)
*  Another volatile and disastrous day in the markets, at least as of this recording right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=0.0s)]
*  Who knows if Donald Trump's gonna make another post saying bye bye bye to potentially manipulate the markets again [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=5.64s)]
*  But this is where we're at right now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=12.52s)]
*  Our economy looks like a freaking Trump meme coin right now and what are the mega Republicans saying about this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=14.44s)]
*  Oh, they think it's absolutely great. They love the American economy looking like the dollar sign Trump or the dollar sign [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=21.36s)]
*  Smalania mean coin. Here's mega Republican Congressmember Carlos Jimenez. Here's what he's got to say. He goes no manipulation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=29.22s)]
*  I was sitting with a stockbroker and we is just cool because I'm sitting with a stockbroker [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=36.46s)]
*  Apparently that means no mark of manipulation here play this clip president put out a post on true social at what was it? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=41.3s)]
*  918 a.m [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=47.7s)]
*  We're 937 a.m. I should say where he said this is a great time to buy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  And then of course after 1 p.m. He announced the pause or the blinking on some of the tariffs there [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=55.34s)]
*  Do you have any questions about the timing there was he telling people when it was he tipping people off? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=63.1s)]
*  Was it market manipulation? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=68.86s)]

*  He had no idea what was gonna happen later. I mean look you buy when the market is low and the market [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=85.06s)]
*  I guess that solves the issue. I guess I mean you're literally Congress. I mean you're supposed to do oversight [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=91.66s)]
*  I mean, no [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=97.86s)]

*  We're gonna be able to do a lot of things that we can't do in the world [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=148.9s)]
*  In a much better position [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=152.54s)]

*  So I'm excited about what's happening right now and then just [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=168.06s)]
*  I'm excited about what's happening now remarkable time. Let's bring in Democratic Congressmember from Texas Greg Kassar congressmember remarkable [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  Remarkable times we're living in huh? It's just remarkable [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=180.06s)]
*  How much a culture of corruption has completely? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=184.5s)]
*  Infected and taken over the entire Republican Party. Look, this is all part of the same story [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=189.86s)]
*  They crash the market and then open it up to insider trading so that I don't know members of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  Congress k-street lobbyists the billionaire donor buddies of Donald Trump can cash in after everybody's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=203.86s)]
*  Retirement accounts got screwed over they put out these sorts of crazy blanket tariff proposals [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=211.3s)]
*  And then you've got the president's son out there basically saying I'm here ready to accept bribes or a deal from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=217.78s)]
*  Foreign leaders and foreign oligarchs. They are same thing with the whole doge scam [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=225.06s)]
*  They are threatening your Social Security and your health care all in order to pay for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  Billionaire tax cuts so at the end of the day [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  This is all about basically taking your hard-earned money and giving it to themselves or funneling it to their buddies [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=238.02s)]
*  That's all this is about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=245.56s)]
*  while that market manipulation [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=247.74s)]
*  appear to be [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  Going on while the markets as of this recording as I said at the beginning it's tanking right now [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=251.82000000000002s)]
*  But these trades like a Trump meme coin is he gonna do a post another pump and dump like what the heck is going [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=257.97999999999996s)]
*  Down well all of this is going on the priorities of the Maggots Republicans in the House and Senate was to put forward [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=264.42s)]
*  This budget to take the Senate's budget plan which like nothing like the house's plan [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=270.3s)]
*  But then pretend that they were somehow similar and pass that I guess the only area where they were similar is figuring out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=275.3s)]
*  How to give the most tax cuts for the billionaires? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=281.5s)]
*  I think they had disagreements and how to conceal it like the formula from the Senate looked different than the formula for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=284.9s)]
*  Concealment of the house, but but but talk talk to us about what what what this is and what's going on? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=291.5s)]
*  What they have spent the last couple of days fighting about on the Republican side is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  How much to destroy your health care to pay for billionaire tax cuts how much to destroy? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=302.82s)]
*  Social Security and the Veterans Administration in order to pay for billionaire tax cuts [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=309.02s)]
*  There one area of agreement like you mentioned is to give billionaires and the biggest corporations a tax cut [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  So the summary of the Trump administration [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=320.8s)]
*  So far is that they are jacking up your prices at the grocery store [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=324.6s)]
*  They're jacking up the prices of cars jacking up prices across the board in order to pay for billionaire tax cuts [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  they are stripping your services in order to pay for billionaire tax cuts and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  They want as many of your taxpayer dollars to go to billionaire tax cuts and then they throw in a little bit of variety [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=341.56s)]
*  With things like the bill they packaged in with the budget yesterday to say oh and we want your overdraft fees [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=347.68s)]
*  To go up if you just happen to go up pay a few dollars too much [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  For something at the bank. We want the banks to take more of your money [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  So they they throw in a few other ways to make things cost more [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=359.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=363.04s)]
*  They believe that you pay taxes in order to make them and their friends rich and they believe you need to work longer hours [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=364.24s)]
*  For less pay to make them and their friends rich and maybe they could do a little bit of insider stock trading on the side [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at the end of the day [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  I think this is an opening and an opportunity in the darkest hour [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=378.72s)]
*  For Democrats to again become the party of the everyday working person to put at the top of our agenda getting big money out of politics [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=382.48s)]
*  Getting billionaires out of running our government banning congressional stock trading and say look [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=389.04s)]
*  We've got to get rid of this unholy alliance between corrupt [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Government and corporate greed break that tie for good [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=398.88s)]
*  and I think that is what can rebuild the Democratic Party at this moment and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=402.24s)]
*  Sweep us into office in the upcoming elections [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=406.76s)]
*  You're one of the people leading the campaign to get make sure Elon Musk is done on [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  May 30th you posted by law Elon Musk must be removed by May 30th [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=415.56s)]
*  Tonight house Democrats and Trump a clear message the clock is ticking the law is clear the people are watching [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=420.84s)]
*  Fire Elon Musk tell us about that deadline and what you're doing to try to get that done [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=427.0s)]
*  I heard he was I heard Doge was at FDIC federal deposit insurance car corporation today [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=433.2s)]
*  Where people depend on that especially in times of this market manipulation? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  The biggest news that people at home need to know that maybe they haven't heard is that under the law [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=444.28s)]
*  Donald Trump must fire Elon Musk within the next 50 days [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=451.24s)]
*  there is this part of the law called special government employee status and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=456.72s)]
*  Musk has been exploiting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=462.56s)]
*  That loophole in the law in order to continue to funnel eight million dollars a day in federal government contracts to himself and to his companies [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=464.68s)]
*  While screwing everybody over well the clock is ticking and I just wrote a letter [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=473.24s)]
*  alongside over 75 other Democrats making it clear to Donald Trump that his days are [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=479.08s)]
*  Just running out as a federal government employee the gravy train is coming to a stop and over the next 50 days [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=486.72s)]
*  We need the entire country to make some noise and say that in 50 days Donald Trump has to fire Elon Musk [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=492.92s)]
*  Otherwise, he's breaking another [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=500.92s)]
*  Anti-corruption law and we just can't stand for it. I know you've been speaking in red districts purple districts where [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=503.8s)]
*  Republican Congress members have been too cowardly to hold town halls you were on the tour with Bernie and AOC [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=511.36s)]
*  Talked us a little bit about what you've been seeing what you've been hearing you were at the big hands-off protests [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=518.36s)]
*  I saw your speeches, you know, you're there as well. You're feeling a vibe shift even from when you and I spoke two weeks ago [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=523.64s)]
*  The push back against what the Trump Musk administration is doing. It's here [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=530.44s)]
*  There was a little while right after Trump's election where he said we didn't know if that movement would come well that movement is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  Here and it wants a Democratic Party that is going to stand for working people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=542.64s)]
*  No matter what period stop end of the day [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=548.12s)]
*  We've got to take this moment to be the pro working people [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=551.6s)]
*  Anti-billionaire party and that is what I'm hearing all across the country [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=556.36s)]
*  This message that I'm having here on Midas touch is the exact same message [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=560.76s)]
*  I used on Fox News live the other weekend the exact same message [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=565.72s)]
*  I used on only mission in Spanish the next day the exact same message that I bring into Democratic districts [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=570.36s)]
*  Republican districts and purple districts [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=577.6s)]
*  It's the kind of message that makes sense to the vast majority of the American people [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=579.48s)]
*  Which is you should work hard to be able to pay for the everyday things in your life save a little bit of money [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=583.52s)]
*  And make sure that your kids can have a better life than you've got and be able to have a comfortable retirement [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUYg-Owg64&t=590.3199999999999s)]
