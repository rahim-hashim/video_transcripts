*  Moving Palestinians out to different places. He says Donald Trump also says that he's not looking at pausing tariffs [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Let me show you what went down in the Oval Office [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  Here Donald Trump is asked about being open to pause the tariffs Trump says he's not looking into that play this clip [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  Would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=36.96s)]
*  Well, we're not looking at that. We have many many countries that are coming to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=41.0s)]
*  Negotiate deals with us and they're gonna be fair deals and and certain cases are gonna be be paying [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=46.32s)]
*  Substantial tariffs they'll be fair deals [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=53.12s)]
*  In this next clip here Donald Trump talks about moving the Palestinians to different countries and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=55.92s)]
*  Controlling and taking over Gaza himself play this clip [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  You think that's the way to pressure Hamas to get to a deal [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=74.04s)]
*  Do you think blocking humanitarian aid is also an effective pressure? Well, you know, I feel about the Gaza Strip. I think it's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=77.16s)]
*  an incredible piece of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=83.0s)]
*  Important real estate and I think it's something that we would be involved in but you know [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=85.4s)]
*  Having a peace force like the United States there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=91.96s)]
*  Controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=95.36s)]
*  Because right now all it is is for years and years all I hear about is killing and Hamas and problems [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=98.36s)]
*  And if you take the people the Palestinians and move them around to different countries and you have plenty of countries that will [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=104.56s)]
*  do that and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=111.6s)]
*  You really have a freedom of freedom zone. You go with the freedom zone [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=113.48s)]
*  Trump is asked about mixed messages coming out of the White House about tariffs and about other economic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=117.84s)]
*  Policy then Donald Trump randomly says we need open borders. Yes, we need open borders says Donald Trump play this clip [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=125.84s)]
*  Mr. President, who is going to represent the US in the talks with you? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=134.42s)]
*  Two questions. Do you expect any of these deals to be made before April 9th? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=141.22s)]
*  And secondly, there have been some mixed messages from your administration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=145.82s)]
*  You're talking about negotiations and yet others in your administration are saying that these tariffs are actually permanent. What is that? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=149.1s)]
*  Well, it can be it can both be true [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=155.42s)]
*  That can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs we need [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  Open borders, you know, we almost had a deal with China [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump is now the we need open borders president [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=168.66000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure the MAGA base won't care whatever the hell he says because literally he can say anything to their MAGA mush brain here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=172.62s)]
*  Donald Trump then falsely says that the richest period for the United States of America was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=180.9s)]
*  1870 to 1913 and we have to make America in 2025 look more like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  1870 America play this clip. He's setting a table and we're gonna have great trade and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=194.44s)]
*  we're gonna have a very strong country our country is gonna be at a level that is as [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=198.92s)]
*  Maybe never been or maybe you know, our country was the strongest believe it or not from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  1870 to 1913, you know why it was all tariff based. We had no income tax [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Then in 1913 some genius came up with the idea of let's charge the people of our country not foreign [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=215.96s)]
*  countries that are ripping off our country and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=222.68s)]
*  The country was never [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=225.88s)]
*  Relatively was never that kind of wealth. We had so much wealth. We didn't know what to do with our money [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  We had meetings we had we had committees and these committees works tirelessly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=233.76s)]
*  To study one subject we have so much money. What are we gonna do with it? Who are we gonna give it to? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=240.28s)]
*  Well, there was indeed a massive financial panic in the 1890s that nearly destroyed the country as far as ghost points out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=246.72s)]
*  JP Morgan had to bail America out. Yes. Donald Trump is truly a historically illiterate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=254.92s)]
*  imbecile as the account says [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=261.36s)]
*  Next Donald Trump says the price of groceries and then he keeps saying I like that word [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=263.26s)]
*  Groceries, they call these things groceries play this clip. We're really doing amazing. I mean we're cutting prices because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=269.24s)]
*  Prices got so high people couldn't live. I mean the prices for groceries the prices for standard [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=276.64s)]
*  Standard groceries standard things were going through the roof. They couldn't live and now those prices are coming down [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=282.4s)]
*  So call them groceries, but that's down energy is down and interest rates are down [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=288.4s)]
*  Everything's down and Donald Trump continued throughout this Oval Office meeting to show how demented he is by continuing to say the word [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  groceries and what an interesting word an [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=301.38s)]

*  Eggs, so when I got in the press went absolutely crazy the first week [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=314.82000000000005s)]
*  I said eggs have quadrupled in price. I said I just got here. Tell me about it and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=320.04s)]
*  Brooke Rollins and our team did a great job and eggs are down now [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=325.6s)]

*  Donald it's not an old-fashioned word the word groceries [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=336.76s)]
*  Again, could you imagine anybody in that position sitting in the White House saying groceries? It's kind of an interesting word groceries [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=340.72s)]
*  I can guarantee you it would be all over Fox [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=347.68s)]
*  24 hours a day it would be on the front page of the New York Post [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=351.2s)]
*  They would be mocking just that right but here we've got Donald Trump crashing international markets creating [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=355.0s)]

*  I mean it looks literally like a Trump meme coin at this point [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=380.24s)]
*  That's not the way it's supposed to look but here Donald Trump then lies and says we don't have any [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=383.88s)]

*  It's got to be fair. It's not fair. And again the things he says are so [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=409.2s)]
*  Outrageously false that you think to yourself sometimes you go. Wait a minute. Are we not selling cars to the EU? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjORv1M-i-c&t=413.52s)]
