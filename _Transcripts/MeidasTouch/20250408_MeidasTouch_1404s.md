# FED UP Dems SMACK DOWN Trump for TOTAL FAILURE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos)
*  We covered the massive hands-off protests over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's cover some of the Democrats who are now going on TV and fighting back, going gloves off, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=4.08s)]
*  going, I guess as they would say in Canada, elbows up. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Here is Democratic governor of Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz talking about Donald Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=14.48s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=21.52s)]
*  Donald Trump snatching up college grad students and sending them back or sending folks to El [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=22.64s)]
*  Salvador illegally, that's not the policy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=27.28s)]
*  But for us to them to say we don't care that violent criminals come in, we most certainly do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=29.76s)]
*  What we were asking for is the resources to make sure they don't get here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=34.88s)]
*  And the same thing with the other policies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=38.56s)]
*  It's not a woke policy to provide food for children, to get breakfast and lunch, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  and we get better outcomes from that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=46.32s)]
*  They defined things on their terms that weren't true. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=48.32s)]
*  And what I'm saying is are we going to turn away from being a country of legal immigration? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=51.6s)]
*  Are we going to turn away from a country that thinks diversity and making sure that we don't [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=56.24s)]
*  have gaps in income between blacks and whites? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=61.68s)]
*  Those are policies that have strengthened America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think what we allowed ourselves to do is we got timid. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=67.12s)]
*  And then when we got power, we didn't pass things that improved people's lives. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=70.4s)]
*  This whole idea, I think the Democratic Party gets theoretical, you know, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=75.12s)]
*  talk about food insecurity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  People are hungry, get them food. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  As I've said before, I wish we saw more of this side of Governor Walz during the campaign, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=82.08s)]
*  although I thought he was great during the campaign. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  I just like when he's a little looser and just speaking from the heart. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Here he is again saying, what are they even talking about woke policy? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=93.6s)]
*  Because we're trying to give people food and we're trying to give people an education. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=103.36s)]
*  Donald Trump snatching up college grad students and sending them back or sending folks to El [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=104.32s)]
*  Salvador illegally, that's not the policy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=108.96s)]
*  But for us to them to say, we don't care that violent criminals come in, we most certainly do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=111.44s)]
*  What we were asking for is the resources to make sure they don't get here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=116.56s)]
*  And the same thing with the other policies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=120.24s)]
*  It's not a woke policy to provide food for children, to get breakfast and lunch, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=122.8s)]
*  and we get better outcomes from that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  They defined things on their terms that weren't true. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=130.0s)]
*  And what I'm saying is, are we going to turn away from being a country of legal immigration? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=133.28s)]
*  Are we going to turn away from a country that thinks diversity and making sure that we don't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=137.84s)]
*  have gaps in income between blacks and whites? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=143.28s)]
*  Those are policies that have strengthened America. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=146.56s)]
*  And I think what we allowed ourselves to do is we got timid. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=148.88s)]
*  And then when we got power, we didn't pass things that improved people's lives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=152.08s)]
*  This whole idea, I think the Democratic Party gets theoretical. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=156.8s)]
*  Talk about food insecurity. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=160.56s)]
*  People are hungry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=161.84s)]
*  Get them food. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=162.56s)]
*  Next up, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=163.84s)]
*  He's been on the Midas Touch Network numerous times. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=167.12s)]
*  Here he is on Meet the Press talking about this enduring image of Donald Trump golfing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=170.24s)]
*  over the weekend as the markets were crashing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=176.72s)]
*  As Donald Trump told people, he doesn't give an F if people are upset. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=179.68s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, he's wrecking our economy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=185.52s)]
*  I think people have seen their retirement savings on fire. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=188.56s)]
*  And there he is out on the golf course. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=192.72s)]
*  That may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=195.2s)]
*  That is the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=198.48s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary saying that people aren't looking at where the retirement savings are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=204.32s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't have to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=208.72s)]
*  He's got the wealth. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=209.76s)]
*  He doesn't have to. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Maybe the president with his wealth doesn't have to. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=211.2s)]
*  But what I'm hearing from Californians is those that have just retired, those are on the EVA [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=213.44s)]
*  retiring, they're terrified of this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=219.44s)]
*  And I hope and pray we stay out of recession. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=223.12s)]
*  But if we head into a recession, it will be the Trump recession. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=226.72s)]
*  He will completely own it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=230.56s)]
*  This is a completely self-destructive economic act that he's engaged in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=231.92s)]
*  Senator Schiff is meeting the moment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=237.92s)]
*  He's got a great social media and digital team as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's take a look at what Senator Cantwell, Maria Cantwell of the state of Washington [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=243.68s)]
*  has to say. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=249.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=250.48s)]
*  Listen, I listened to your segment. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=251.52s)]
*  I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=254.0s)]
*  And the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=256.8s)]
*  letters in Greek out, all this stuff that makes no sense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=261.44s)]
*  That's what people, consumers are saying. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=264.16s)]
*  How is this helping me in a time of inflation? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=266.16s)]
*  You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=269.76s)]
*  And so I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=274.32s)]
*  And she's right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=278.08s)]
*  The idea of tariffing the entire world based on a completely fraudulent formula as well, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=279.6s)]
*  where penguins are being tariffed as well as islands that just no human inhabitants [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=288.64s)]
*  or islands that house American military bases and the entire formulas applied wrong as well, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=295.6s)]
*  with a recklessness and a carelessness, as Donald Trump literally says, I don't give [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=303.12s)]
*  enough. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=307.84s)]
*  She's on point right there and we should highlight more of her videos and her [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  interviews and her speeches as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Next up, Democratic Senator Cory Booker, you know, Senator Booker has been meeting the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=316.56s)]
*  moment. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=321.84s)]
*  Here he is saying I've never seen in my life any administration that is intentionally [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=322.56s)]
*  doing the destroying our country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=329.67999999999995s)]
*  My only thing is I would say I call him a regime, not an administration. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=332.32s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=336.64s)]
*  I said earlier in the program, he said there may be some increase in prices, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  but it's going to be worth it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=341.28s)]
*  Your response? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, God bless Kevin, but I've never seen an administration in my lifetime do something [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  so monumentally wrong and that so staggeringly hurts American people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=350.96s)]
*  You know, I've been hearing all day yesterday from frightened Americans who've saved for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  their entire lives for retirement in the coming months. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=363.28s)]
*  But now, no, they can't because in one fell swoop, Donald Trump has devastated their [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=366.0s)]
*  retirement counts, their 401ks. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=370.8s)]
*  I know millions of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck who already in their [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=373.76s)]
*  administration have seen rising prices, even though he promised they would go down, rising [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=377.68s)]
*  inflation, even though he promised it would go down. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=382.32s)]
*  And now they're bracing themselves for seeing their monthly bills go up because of what [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=385.04s)]
*  this president did. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=390.4s)]
*  And that will devastate them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=391.28s)]
*  Also at the protests, Aaron Parnas from the Midas Touch Network. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=393.68s)]
*  Also, Aaron Parnas has his own independent media network as well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=398.56s)]
*  He was on he was inside embedded in the protests. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=402.8s)]
*  Here he is speaking to a Democratic congress member, Jamie Raskin. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=412.16s)]
*  I'm here with Congressman Jamie Raskin from Maryland. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=413.12s)]
*  Now, Congressman, why did you choose to come to this protest? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=415.68s)]
*  And why is it so impactful in this moment right now? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=419.36s)]
*  Well, my congressional district is in Maryland and it borders Washington, D.C. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=422.0s)]
*  So we have tens of thousands of people from Maryland who come down here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=425.28s)]
*  So this is the one I did, even though I was in Florida, actually, with Maxwell Frost for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=429.28s)]
*  the rest of the weekend. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=433.44s)]
*  So this demonstration across the country with more than a thousand different protests is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=435.92s)]
*  going to is going to further catalyze popular resistance and opposition to this deranged [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=441.76s)]
*  program that they're imposing on the country. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=449.04s)]
*  Now, a lot of folks are concerned, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=450.56s)]
*  There are a lot of people have told me that they're being fired, especially the IRS right [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=452.08s)]
*  now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=455.52s)]
*  What's your message to those who have been terminated at the federal government? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=455.92s)]

*  The president has made it crystal crystal clear. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=878.8s)]
*  This is the policy. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=881.8199999999999s)]

*  holding up that chart that you helped make, that wasn't actually tariffs. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=956.4200000000001s)]
*  That was actually confusing to investors because it was some kind of other formula and the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  countries themselves seemed kind of random. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=966.7800000000001s)]
*  Like why are the herd and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=969.62s)]
*  are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face a 10 percent tariffs? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=974.02s)]
*  Did you use a I to generate this? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=980.1s)]
*  No, no, the idea. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=982.66s)]
*  Look, the idea is why are they on the list? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=985.22s)]
*  Because the idea what happens is if you leave anything off the list, the countries that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=989.86s)]
*  try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us, any country like we [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=995.18s)]
*  had tariffs. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1001.98s)]
*  The president put tariffs on China in 2018 and then what China started doing is they [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1003.26s)]
*  started going through other countries to America. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1008.34s)]
*  They just build through other countries through America. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1011.1s)]
*  And so the president knows that he's tired of it and he's going to fix that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1013.78s)]
*  So basically he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1018.74s)]
*  other countries can ship through them. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1024.66s)]
*  So he ended those loopholes, these ridiculous loopholes. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1026.94s)]
*  And now what he's trying to say is I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  of America. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a national security issue. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1037.1000000000001s)]
*  We need to make medicine. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1038.9s)]
*  We need to make semiconductors. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1040.02s)]
*  We need to make ships. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1041.74s)]
*  We need to have steel and aluminum. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1042.74s)]
*  Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1044.7s)]
*  And he's tired. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1048.8600000000001s)]
*  That's my Scott Bessent impression. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1049.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's offensive or not an offensive impression. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1051.3s)]
*  I think it's accurate of what the most arrogant guy imaginable, you know, saying, yeah, you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1053.78s)]

*  It's my Scott Bessent impression right there. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1067.5s)]
*  Here's a MAGA Republican Congress member Bacon here. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1069.74s)]
*  He's asked about tariffs and how it's going to raise prices and cause a recession or Great [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  Depression. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1080.66s)]
*  And rather than answer the question, because these MAGA Republicans are so cowardly, here [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1081.66s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress member Dan Bacon, he's like, let me just give you a history [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1086.6200000000001s)]
*  lesson on tariffs, which cause depressions, but I'm too cowardly to actually link it with [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1092.1000000000001s)]
*  the current regime. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1099.3400000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1100.66s)]
*  The president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1101.66s)]
*  He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1106.8600000000001s)]
*  He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to him. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1109.48s)]
*  Did Republicans just not take him seriously? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1114.64s)]
*  There's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1116.96s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1120.04s)]
*  You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republicans supported tariffs in the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1121.04s)]
*  1800s and up through 1930 when we passed the Smoot-Hartley Act that created one of the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1124.48s)]
*  worst, well, the worst depression we ever had. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1130.4s)]
*  We learned from that that tariffs and protectionism does not work in a free trade in the end, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1132.7s)]
*  as long as it's fair. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1138.92s)]
*  We want fair trade. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1139.92s)]
*  And I support the president wanting to get fairness. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1140.92s)]
*  So these countries do treat us wrong, but fair trade should be the goal. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1143.22s)]
*  And you're right, the president talked about this. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1146.6000000000001s)]
*  He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  But here's my take on it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1151.96s)]
*  And I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  People voted for President Trump because of the border and he is really delivered there. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1156.78s)]
*  They voted for him. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1160.52s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, have you seen the pins that they're wearing, the lapel pins that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1161.52s)]
*  these magas like the head of the Federal Communications Commission and others, they've got this like [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1166.6s)]
*  Trump pin that they wear with Trump's face on it on their lapel. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1175.52s)]
*  They wear Trump lapel people. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1178.9599999999998s)]
*  If you ever wonder how do you get like Putin and Kim Jong-un and how did you have, you [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1181.84s)]
*  know, how do these, these, these are the humans do this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1188.36s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1193.08s)]
*  These weak, frail humans behave this way. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1194.76s)]
*  Anyway, speaking of weak, frail humans behaving this way, here's the agriculture secretary [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1197.56s)]
*  Brooke Rollins being asked by Jake Tapper about tariffing penguins. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1206.92s)]
*  For example, President Trump laid out with a giant graphic of all the countries where [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1207.92s)]
*  tariffs were going to be, what he called reciprocal tariffs were going to be imposed. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1212.2s)]
*  And you're imposing a 10% tariff on the herd in McDonald Islands. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1216.3600000000001s)]
*  The herd in McDonald Islands have zero human inhabitants. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1220.64s)]
*  They had zero exports. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1224.22s)]
*  They had zero imports. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1225.54s)]
*  They do have a lot of penguins. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1227.1000000000001s)]
*  Why are you putting import tariffs on islands that are entirely populated by penguins? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1229.06s)]
*  Well, I mean that, come on, Jake, obviously here's the bottom line. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1235.5s)]
*  We live under a tariff regime from other countries. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1243.82s)]
*  We have too long seeded. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1247.66s)]
*  The McDonald Islands is not imposing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1248.66s)]
*  The idea that America goes first. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMmRf3TzWos&t=1250.3s)]
