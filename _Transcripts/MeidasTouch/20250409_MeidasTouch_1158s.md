# FURIOUS Canada DESTROYS Trump as WAR ESCALATES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA)
*  Elbows up Canada, Canada strong, Canada proud, Canada standing up to the Trump regime and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=0.0s)]
*  his co-opting of the United States of America. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=9.34s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney issued the following statement yesterday, not backing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=12.68s)]
*  down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=17.76s)]
*  He says, at 12.01 tonight, Canada's counter tariffs will come into force. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=18.76s)]
*  There will be 25% tariffs on all non-CUSMA compliant vehicles from the US and 25% tariffs [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=23.56s)]
*  on the contents of CUSMA compliant vehicles that are not from Canada or Mexico. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=32.04s)]
*  President Trump caused this trade crisis and Canada is responding with purpose and with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=38.36s)]
*  force. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=44.84s)]
*  The boycott by Canada of all things American is getting stronger. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=45.88s)]
*  By some counts 70, 85% of leisure tourism coming to a screeching halt from Canadian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=51.96s)]
*  tourism into the United States. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Also, the by Canada movement in Canada is absolutely crushing it and crushing the United [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=64.0s)]
*  States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=71.48s)]
*  He's also setting an example to the rest of the world, to Europe, to Australia, to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=72.48s)]
*  New Zealand, to Africa, to South America, to Central America, to Mexico, to others. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  How you stand up to the Trump regime. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=82.56s)]
*  Look, I got to hand it to Prime Minister Carney. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  He's standing up strong to the Trump regime. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=88.12s)]
*  He recently spoke in Richmond, British Columbia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to show you some key portions of the speech that he just gave. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=94.48s)]
*  Let's play this clip first. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=98.44s)]
*  The global economy has fundamentally changed because of these actions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=99.68s)]
*  The system of global trade that's existed all my life, most of, well everyone in this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=105.68s)]
*  room pretty much, the system of trade that was anchored on the United States that we [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=110.92s)]
*  as a country have relied on since the end of the Second World War. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  A system that while not perfect has helped deliver prosperity to our country for decades. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=119.72s)]
*  That system is over. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=128.02s)]
*  That system is over. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  And our old relationship, our old relationship with the United States, which in fits and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=134.02s)]
*  starts but in the same direction, was based on steadily deepening integration, getting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  closer with the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=146.08s)]
*  That relationship is over. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=148.86s)]
*  In many ways, this is a tragedy, but it's the new reality and we have to respond to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=154.26s)]
*  it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  And we are responding. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  We are responding as Canada. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=164.06s)]
*  We are responding with purpose and with force. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=165.54s)]
*  We will fight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=168.38s)]
*  We will protect and we will build. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  We will build. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  Contrast Prime Minister Carney like a real leader, a banker who guided Canada through [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=179.94s)]
*  the Great Recession of the early to mid 2000s, someone who as a banker led the UK through [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=187.3s)]
*  Brexit during its most difficult crisis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=195.52s)]
*  Cool, calm, composed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=198.34s)]
*  Contrast that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=200.82s)]
*  The banker to Trump, the bankruptor, the destroyer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=201.82s)]
*  Trump was never a builder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=206.38s)]
*  He just destroyed and bankrupted the things that he touched in his life despite being [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=208.26s)]
*  born with a golden spoon in his mouth from his daddy who gave him his money. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=213.38s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump last night at the National Republican meeting that took place last night [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=219.17999999999998s)]
*  in Washington DC, Congressional campaign meeting that took place in Washington DC. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=225.62s)]
*  Donald Trump's like, all the countries are calling me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  They're kissing my ass. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=232.7s)]
*  They're kissing my ass. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=234.18s)]
*  So take a look at the first clip I showed you with Prime Minister Carney contrasted [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  to this pathetic loser behavior by Donald Trump playing this clip. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  This is the largest transaction in the history of our country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=245.18s)]
*  And don't let some of these policies go around saying, you know, because I'm telling you, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=249.26s)]
*  these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  They are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=257.5s)]
*  They are dying to make a deal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=258.74s)]
*  Please, please make a deal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=260.5s)]
*  I'll do anything. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=262.14s)]
*  I'll do anything, sir. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=263.14s)]
*  I mean, look, when you've lost Rand Paul, Donald, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=264.85999999999996s)]
*  mega Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky, who no doubt knows Kentucky's economy is getting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=269.38s)]
*  crushed by the Canadian boycott. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=275.58s)]
*  Kentucky bourbon, other Kentucky booze getting crushed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=278.06s)]
*  When you lost Rand Paul, Donald, you've lost the plot. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=283.62s)]
*  Here's mega Republican Rand Paul saying, we talk about the truth. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=286.17999999999995s)]
*  We have to, Trump's lying about Canada play this clip. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=289.94s)]
*  We have to start from talking about the truth. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=293.06s)]
*  One of the things they say with Canada is, oh, there's a 270 percent tariff on dairy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=295.74s)]
*  products going from the U.S. into Canada. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=300.94s)]
*  Well, you know what the real tariff is? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=302.94s)]
*  Zero. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=305.02s)]
*  That's a big difference between what the truth is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=306.02s)]
*  So there's a certain amount of goods, dairy goods that go to Canada every year, and they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=308.5s)]
*  go at zero percent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=312.42s)]
*  If we exceed a certain amount, there's this ridiculous 270 percent tariff, but we've never [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=314.26s)]
*  encountered it, and the USMC renegotiated it and raised the level that's under zero. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=319.42s)]
*  Trump should be congratulated for USMC raising the amount of dairy that goes in at zero, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=325.54s)]
*  but we have to have an honest debate. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=331.62s)]
*  We can't go around saying that there's a 270 percent tariff when that's not really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=333.66s)]
*  the truth. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  Wild that I'm saying, I agree with what mega Republican Senator Rand Paul's saying there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's go back to Prime Minister Cardi's powerful speech in Richmond in connection with the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=345.06s)]
*  campaign for leadership. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=350.62s)]
*  The current snap election underway, the campaign is underway. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=353.82s)]
*  April 28th is the day of the election. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=358.74s)]
*  Prime Minister Cardi's Liberal Party keeps growing in support over Pierre Poliev's Conservative [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=362.22s)]
*  Party as Pierre Poliev was previously full maple maga. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=368.18s)]
*  He's trying to pretend that he wasn't. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=372.9s)]
*  Daniel Smith of Alberta not doing him much favors, trying to engage in election interference [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=375.5s)]
*  of the Canadian elections with Donald Trump and Donald Trump posting how Daniel Smith [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  and the Conservative Party are, they love Donald Trump, 51st state crap, so not exactly [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=386.17999999999995s)]
*  doing themselves much favors. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=391.26s)]
*  Anyway, here's Prime Minister Cardi in a speech in Richmond. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=395.34s)]
*  We as a country are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=396.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=402.41999999999996s)]
*  President Trump, President Trump wants to break us so that America, so that America [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  can own us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=412.02s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=415.38s)]
*  It will never ever happen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=416.38s)]
*  It will never happen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=418.38s)]
*  But we, we are over. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=421.38s)]
*  And this has been tough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=428.17999999999995s)]
*  We're over the shock now of the betrayal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=431.18s)]
*  But we should never forget the lessons of what's happened. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=434.18s)]
*  We have, we, elbows up is one, yes, we have to, we have to look out for ourselves and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=438.18s)]
*  we have to take care of each other. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=447.94s)]
*  And you know there's some regret here because we didn't ask for this fight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=452.7s)]
*  We didn't ask for it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=462.98s)]
*  But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=465.06s)]
*  And in, and in a trade war, in a trade war just like in hockey, we will win. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=470.5s)]
*  We will get stronger while they get weaker. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=481.94s)]
*  Now, hockey, hockey has played a big part of my life, as many of yours. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=491.94s)]
*  I'm not going to point out that there's an Euler fan here. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=502.7s)]
*  I grew up, I grew up with the values that I learned on the ice at the rink, at the kitchen table, in the classroom. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=508.46s)]
*  My parents were teachers who stressed the importance of hard work. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=515.46s)]
*  Of hard work. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=520.46s)]
*  You're a teacher, you're a teacher too? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=522.46s)]
*  The importance of supporting each other in community and the importance of caring for other people. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=524.46s)]
*  My coaches, my hockey coaches taught me to play hard, to be ambitious. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=530.46s)]
*  But because it's Canada, also to be humble. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=536.22s)]
*  And I kept those values close to me when I was managing crises here in Canada and around the world. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=539.22s)]
*  And I remembered them whenever I was working with others to build strong economies. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=545.22s)]
*  And now I'm drawing on them to stand up to Donald Trump and to build the strongest economy in the G7, an economy that works for everyone. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=551.22s)]

*  Here's another great line from Prime Minister Carney's speech. Let's play it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=682.02s)]
*  Once again, Donald Trump imposed massive tariffs on the world. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=686.78s)]
*  This time, he skipped Canada. We got the best of a series of bad deals. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=694.78s)]
*  We can handle him. We are going to handle him. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=703.78s)]
*  We can handle him. We can handle Donald Trump. That's what he misses, and I'm going to go into that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=709.78s)]
*  But there are three other sets of tariffs in place on auto, on steel and aluminum, and now they are threatening tariffs or announcing tariffs on softwood lumber. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=715.54s)]
*  They are threatening our businesses, our workers, our families. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=726.54s)]
*  And all of these tariffs, all of these tariffs, you have different excuses for them. They are all unjustified. They are all unwarranted. They are all misguided. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=733.54s)]
*  And here's the thing that I think that Prime Minister Carney recognized and former Prime Minister Trudeau recognized. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=745.54s)]
*  You can't give Donald Trump an inch. As I've said before from day one, you give Trump an inch, Trump takes your life. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=754.54s)]
*  He doesn't view concessions as good faith. He views it as weakness. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=764.54s)]
*  By the way, that's why Xi Jinping is saying, all right, Donald, you're ready to go? We'll fight. China will fight until the end. Donald, let's go. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=770.3s)]
*  And Donald Trump's now picking these fights, but Canada was, I think, the initial country to show the way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=778.3s)]
*  I mean, so even like the European Union Commission, they initially proposed to drop tariffs to zero and to do a zero to zero kind of tariff swap with Donald Trump. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=784.3s)]
*  And Donald Trump's like, nope, even if the EU reduces its tariffs to zero against the United States, we need to force them to buy American products. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=796.06s)]
*  They have to buy all American energy or else. So there's like nothing that you could absolutely do. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=807.06s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said when he was asked if the European Union agreeing to drop tariffs to zero would be enough to get a deal. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=814.06s)]
*  And Trump says, nope, it wouldn't. Here, play this clip. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=822.06s)]
*  Mr. President, you said the EU has said that they have offered zero for zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Is that not enough? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=824.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, the EU, no, it's not. The EU has been very tough over the years. It was, I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  That's the reason it was formed. It was formed with all of the countries from Europe, I guess most of them, not all of them, but most of them. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=846.58s)]
*  And they formed together to create a little bit of a monopoly situation to create a unified force against the United States for trade. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=854.58s)]
*  So they have NATO, which is largely the same countries, and they took advantage of us dollar-wise and militarily until I got there. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=863.58s)]
*  I was able to get $600 billion from NATO. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=873.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, here's Howard Lutnick then going on TV and whining that Europe won't buy our beef, Europe won't buy this. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=877.34s)]
*  I mean, just whiny. I mean, again, contrast the whininess to like adult leadership from Prime Minister Carney. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=886.34s)]
*  Here, watch Howard Lutnick. Let's play this clip right here. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=894.34s)]
*  I mean, the European Union won't take chicken from America. They won't take lobsters from America. They hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=897.1s)]
*  Folks, just turning to Germany for a second. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=910.1s)]
*  Germany economy minister Robert Habeck taking a jab against Trump and Musk with these three key statements yesterday. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=913.1s)]
*  The U.S. calculations for their tariffs are nonsense. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=920.86s)]
*  The U.S. is now in a position of weakness. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=924.86s)]
*  We can hurt them in pharma. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=928.86s)]
*  So he said we can hurt them in pharma. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=931.86s)]
*  So then what did Donald Trump do? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=934.86s)]
*  Then Donald Trump said, okay, we're going to impose tariffs on pharma. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=936.86s)]
*  That's what Trump said last night. We're going to impose tariffs on pharma. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=941.86s)]
*  Here's Trump saying that. Let's play this clip. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=944.86s)]
*  They're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals and once we do that, they're going to come rushing back into our country because we're the big market. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=947.62s)]
*  The advantage we have over everybody is that we're the big market. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=954.62s)]
*  So we're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals and when they hear that, they will leave China, they will leave other places because they have to sell most of their product is sold here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=958.62s)]
*  Going to impose tariffs on pharma. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=972.38s)]
*  Okay, Donald Trump. So now Americans who need pharmaceuticals or else they're going to die are not going to be able to get the medication they need because of your irrational, destructive, and outright stupid trade war. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=975.38s)]
*  I also want to mention this. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=991.38s)]
*  Here you have the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying, you know, can we be real here for a second? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=994.38s)]
*  When JD Vance was saying that we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called this ignorant and impolite. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1002.38s)]
*  Here he is saying that. Here's the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs minister. Let's play it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1018.38s)]
*  And again, you just see how other world leaders are like behaving like with maturity while the Trump regime behaves like literal petulant babies. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1032.3799999999999s)]
*  No offense to petulant babies. No offense to cornered rats. That's how the Trump regime is behaving is cornered rats and petulant babies behave better. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1043.3799999999999s)]
*  The futures are getting crushed as of my recording of this. We'll see what happens when the markets actually open. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1052.3799999999999s)]
*  And let me leave you with this right here. This is Prime Minister Carney. Again, here he's talking about how Trump's now trying to attack Canadian lumber. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1059.14s)]
*  Listen to what Prime Minister Carney has to say. Let's play it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1069.14s)]
*  Well, the U.S. is trying to keep high quality, sustainable Canadian lumber out. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1072.14s)]
*  We will use more of it here in our plan to double the pace of housing construction in this country over the course of the next 10 years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1079.14s)]
*  This is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1087.9s)]
*  We will build our way out of the housing crisis. We will build our way out of the economic crisis. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1093.9s)]
*  We will make housing more affordable in Canada once more. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1098.9s)]
*  I think you see how that leadership looks compared to whatever the heck Donald Trump's doing right there. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1103.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is an embarrassment, a fool. Donald Trump is a sexual predator. He is a felon. He is a fraud. He is a bankruptor. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1109.66s)]
*  He is a vile and despicable human being who's doing with the United States economy what he did to all of his bankrupt businesses in the past. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbr2KPwtGSA&t=1118.66s)]
