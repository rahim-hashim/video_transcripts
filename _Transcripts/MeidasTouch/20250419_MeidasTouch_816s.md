# Trump THROWS TANTRUM to HIDE IT ALL as he IMPLODES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c)
*  As Donald Trump's failures continue to mount, as his regime is showing what an utter disaster it is, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's plan now is what his plan usually always is, which is just attack the data. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=7.2s)]
*  Remember what he said back in 2020 with COVID, which he completely mishandled, didn't handle at [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=12.88s)]
*  all. If you don't do the testing, then you don't know, you don't have to know what's even going on. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  So here's what we know from today, a great article out from ProPublica. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=23.52s)]
*  Trump's war on measurement means losing data on drug use, maternal mortality, climate change, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=28.0s)]
*  and more. He's just going to try to erase the data gathering from the various agencies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=35.04s)]
*  And I'll just give you an example right now. There was a deadly E. coli outbreak that hit 15 states, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=41.44s)]
*  but the FDA chose not to publicize it. That would normally be something that would be publicized. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=47.36s)]
*  This is from NBC, which found out about it. The outbreak linked to romaine lettuce killed one [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  person and sickened at least 88 more, including a nine-year-old boy who nearly died of kidney [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=58.4s)]
*  failure. But that really didn't get reported anywhere until now. And had we known about that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=64.24s)]
*  people could have taken safety precautions. I was also thinking about that press conference [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=69.36s)]
*  that Donald Trump did in the Oval Office on Friday, where he tried to claim that the real [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=73.52s)]
*  issue with eggs and egg prices are that they're too cheap and there's too many eggs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=79.76s)]
*  Just play this clip of what Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=85.84s)]
*  And the egg prices are down 87%. But nobody talks about that. You can have all the eggs [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=88.96s)]
*  you want. We have too many eggs. In fact, if anything, the prices are getting too low. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  So I just want to let you know prices. Yeah, just entirely false. US egg prices have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  increased to record highs going into Easter. You know, literally, if you look at the remaining [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=108.24s)]
*  data that we have, you can see that, but they want to get rid of all of that data. And to me, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  it's a throwback, as I said at the outset of this video to what he was saying in 2020. Don't do the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=118.08s)]
*  testing. Then you don't know if there are cases. Remember this. We made this video a few years back [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=122.88s)]
*  at the Midas Touch Network. Here play this clip. So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=127.52s)]
*  Come on now. That was tongue in cheek. Please. I don't know that it was tongue in cheek. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=139.6s)]
*  I know it was tongue in cheek. He has said testing is frankly [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=144.0s)]
*  overrated. We absolutely need to significantly ramp up the number of tests. He said that you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  told your staff to slow the testing down to improve the numbers. Did you ask to slow it down? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=156.72s)]
*  It was a comment that he made in Jess. I don't kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=164.72s)]
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congress member Chris Pappas, who's also running for the Senate seat in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=170.56s)]
*  New Hampshire. Congressman Pappas, first off, welcome to the Midas Touch Network, your first [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  time on the network. Hopefully we get you back again. What do you make of all of that, though? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=181.68s)]
*  Trump's attack on the truth, on facts. Well, thanks. It's great to be on with you. And we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=185.68s)]
*  know how estranged Donald Trump is from the truth. And the fact is his administration isn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=192.16s)]
*  interested in data. They're not interested in science. They're only interested in power [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=197.6s)]
*  and making life more chaotic for Americans all across our country. And that's what they're doing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=203.04s)]
*  I was talking with folks that had contracts with the Department of Education recently, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=208.4s)]
*  and they were telling me how the Department of Ed has ceased the collection of data. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=213.92s)]
*  So just putting on a blindfold, not wanting to know what's going on in education across our [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=219.12s)]
*  country, not wanting to know how our kids are doing and where the gaps exist. They fired [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=224.48s)]
*  individuals that have been working in this space for decades and decades that have very specialized [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=229.76s)]
*  expertise into how our education systems work and how best we can approach improving our schools for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  the future. So this is a full out assault, not just on government, but really on our ability [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=240.72s)]
*  as a country and as communities to solve problems, to know where the challenges lie and to know how [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  best to address them collectively moving forward. So it's a deeply chilling moment, I think, for our [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=254.4s)]
*  democracy and the ability of our government to work for everyday Americans. And you know, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=259.6s)]
*  look, government needs to be a stabilizing force that's informed by reality, that's informed by [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=264.4s)]
*  the data in order to be able to fulfill its mission. But Donald Trump, we know, and the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=270.4s)]
*  folks around him, they don't believe in the mission of government. They only believe in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=276.4s)]
*  Donald Trump and amassing more power. And they're doing it at the expense of the American people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=279.92s)]
*  And we've got to continue to find ways to stand up, to be counted, to provide a full accounting of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=285.44s)]
*  the damage that's being done, and to work to try to put up guardrails wherever possible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=290.32s)]
*  Let's talk about that hostile takeover of the federal government by Trump and Musk, even in the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  data that we've seen. Federal spending is actually up right now. There's more federal spending than [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=303.04s)]
*  under former President Biden, and they've wrecked the federal government in the process. What are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=309.28s)]
*  you hearing from your constituents with all of these cuts to the programs from shutting down [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=314.64s)]
*  Social Security offices, the attack on Medicaid, the attack on the Department of Education, the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=321.2s)]
*  attack on veteran services, and basically every other essential service and service in general? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  People are deeply concerned with what they're seeing right now. And it is far reaching in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  terms of its impacts. It's the delivery of critical programs, including those earned benefits like [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=337.28s)]
*  Social Security. People are going to have to wait longer to be able to apply for benefits or to get [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  a question answered because they've moved to fire half the people that work for the Social Security [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  Administration. You think about the VA and the positive steps we've taken over the last few years [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=352.96s)]
*  on a bipartisan basis, mind you, to expand care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  and burn pits. But they're moving to fire 80,000 people, including people who provide direct care [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=364.64s)]
*  to veterans and others who answer crisis lines and process claims. That's all having an impact [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=370.56s)]
*  on the ability of our government to deliver on its promise to those who risk everything for our [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  nation and who defended our freedoms. So it's an urgent challenge right now. We are working to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=382.08s)]
*  hear directly from our constituents, from our communities, from local nonprofits, all of whom [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=388.0s)]
*  are really disturbed, angry, and anxious about what's happening in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=393.04s)]
*  And we've got to make sure that we're using every tool possible on the inside to address this. So [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=398.56s)]
*  we're signing letters, we're sponsoring legislation, we're signing on to court briefs, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=403.12s)]
*  we're giving remarks on the floor, we're holding press conferences, but we also need the public [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=407.04s)]
*  really to be engaged in this, in helping to bring the fight in Washington back home. So whether that's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=411.36s)]
*  talking about this in terms of jobs and livelihoods, on funding that's being withheld from our [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=417.04s)]
*  communities, on just the ability to deliver critical services, especially to some of our [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=422.56s)]
*  most vulnerable citizens, this attack is far ranging and we're deeply concerned about where [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  it goes next. We know that the reconciliation package with drastic cuts to Medicaid that could [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=432.4s)]
*  essentially end health care coverage for tens of millions of Americans and jeopardize the care [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=439.04s)]
*  provided by our community health centers and hospitals, all in the name of providing tax breaks [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=444.24s)]
*  to billionaires like Elon Musk. It is the most backward priorities that you could ever come up [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=449.6s)]
*  with in a bill and people are really incensed about it and we're going to continue to try to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=454.72s)]
*  fight on the inside as best we can to stop that legislation. And then you have Donald Trump [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  declaring a trade war against the world using a made-up cockamamie formula that was based on [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=464.8s)]
*  deficits to claim what the reciprocal tariff rate was and then he put him on and then he put him off [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=473.12s)]
*  and then he put him on against adversaries and allies alike. I mean constantly attacking Canada [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=478.88s)]
*  saying he wants to conquer it and annex it and saying that about other countries, picking fights [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=485.92s)]
*  against the EU, fights against Australia and now we're seeing real impacts of this. I mean we're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=490.88s)]
*  seeing the tariffs starting to impact the cost of goods affecting businesses. What's going on in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=497.76s)]
*  New Hampshire with these tariffs? Well as you can imagine New Hampshire which borders Canada has [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=503.68s)]
*  deep ties to our Canadian partners and our economy is very much interconnected and so we benefit from [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=508.48s)]
*  free trade with Canada. That's why updating the USMCA under the first Trump administration was an [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=515.44s)]
*  important step forward to protect those trading partnerships and to make sure that we're also [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=521.04s)]
*  protecting domestic industries in America. But what I'm hearing from small businesses is that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=526.32s)]
*  things are getting more expensive. 88% of small businesses import products in order to sell them [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=531.36s)]
*  to customers or to make something else that they're delivering to customers right here in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=538.08s)]
*  America. So that's making things more expensive. It's a huge tax not only on our small businesses [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=543.44s)]
*  but on the American public and I've heard that very directly from our small business community. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  In addition to that our businesses that export to places like Canada or China are also being hit [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=552.96s)]
*  hard. I had a an extensive conversation with businesses in our forest products industry which [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  is important here in New Hampshire. We're the second most forested state in the country [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=564.32s)]
*  and they have a huge market in China which now is being hit with 150% reciprocal tariff and so [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=568.32s)]
*  that market is going to go away. People are going to lose their jobs and so whether that's in logging, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  in the sawmills, or in the lumber yards there is tremendous pressure that they're just not going to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  be able to navigate. I was talking to them about some of the legislative efforts that we hope to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=587.44s)]
*  undertake and maybe pull some Republicans along with us and they said look we just can't wait. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=591.76s)]
*  This is urgent. This is existential for our business and if we don't get some relief from [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=596.56s)]
*  the president we can't just wait a few months for Congress to pass something. So we need to make [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=601.12s)]
*  sure that we are leveraging the voices that we're hearing in our districts from the small business [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=606.88s)]
*  community that are being heard on on both sides of the trading relationship. It's really devastating [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=611.52s)]
*  and it comes at a time where we should be taking every step possible to lower costs to make housing [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=616.48s)]
*  more affordable, to make sure child care is more available, and to lower the cost of energy. This [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=621.52s)]
*  is just hitting people where it hurts at a time where most families and businesses can't afford it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=626.88s)]

*  Our Senator Jean Shaheen decided to retire at the end of her term which comes up in 2026. And so I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=666.48s)]
*  decided to jump in this race. I think this is a moment where we all should look to go beyond what [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=673.76s)]

*  out how to build the kind of coalitions that we need to be able to confront the damage that is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBR0sAuz0c&t=713.52s)]
