# Fox News CAN’T HIDE as Trump COLLAPSE ACCELERATES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU)
*  State regime media known as Fox is in freefall as it tries to brainwash its audience into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=0.0s)]
*  not blaming Donald Trump on the economic collapse that is now taking place. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=7.16s)]
*  Bond markets are collapsing, the dollar is crashing, the 10 and 30 year treasury yields [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=13.1s)]
*  are rising to levels that we haven't seen in quite some time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=17.88s)]
*  Now state regime media known as Fox wants to blame it on former President Biden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=21.98s)]
*  Let's deconstruct the propaganda machine that is Fox aka state regime media and show [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=26.44s)]
*  you what they were doing last night for example. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  So Laura Ingraham devoted basically her entire show to blaming the economic collapse on former [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=34.4s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=40.22s)]
*  She brings on people who masquerade as economic specialists and they say, yeah, well, we actually [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=41.42s)]
*  can see that the Atlanta Federal Reserve predicts GDP contraction in quarter one, but obviously [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  that's because of former President Biden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=53.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=55.44s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=56.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, it means President Trump and his administration are doing what they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=57.44s)]
*  ran on and the people voted for it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=61.36s)]
*  And so they understand that he's executing what he said he's going to do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Now I think if it gets out of control at some point, things can change. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=68.44s)]
*  And there are some things living and coming up like the GDP now forecast from the Atlanta [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=72.34s)]
*  Fed, which is usually deadly accurate. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=76.4s)]
*  They say we're going to have a two and a two and a half point negative GDP, but that will [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=78.52s)]
*  be for the first quarter and that will be mostly on the last administration, not this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=82.72s)]
*  administration. But right now he's in good shape. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=87.24s)]
*  You know, you see how they say it with this degree of certainty and they present themselves [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  as though they're experts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=94.76s)]
*  You know, here on the Midas Touch Network, we come with receipts and we want to provide [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=96.0s)]
*  you with objective data. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=99.6s)]
*  So let's look at what the Atlanta Federal Reserve actually predicted and projected previously [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=101.4s)]
*  before Donald Trump imposed tariffs against the world and then took them off and put them [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=106.84s)]
*  on, then raised the tariffs against China to 145 percent and created an effective tariff [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=112.0s)]
*  rate when you blend the entire world together. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=117.2s)]
*  Now it's somewhere around 25 percent. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=119.84s)]
*  Take a look right here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=122.12s)]
*  Originally, if Donald Trump did nothing and just let former President Biden's economy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=123.36s)]
*  go on overdrive where there was GDP growth quarter after quarter, we were expecting 3.9 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=127.68s)]
*  percent GDP growth in quarter one under Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=133.52s)]
*  Then Donald Trump started messing with things and it was lower to 2.3 percent, but still [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=137.16s)]
*  growth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=142.2s)]
*  Donald Trump started messing with things and then the Atlanta Federal Reserve projected [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=143.2s)]
*  a 2.8 percent contraction or negative 2.8 percent GDP. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=147.76s)]
*  And now they projected negative 3.7 percent GDP or somewhere between negative 3.7 percent [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=152.68s)]
*  GDP and negative 2.8 percent GDP. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=158.64s)]
*  Those are the facts. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=161.52s)]
*  That's the objective data. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=162.52s)]
*  Had Trump done nothing, he could have taken credit for former President Biden's economy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=163.56s)]
*  and gotten like 4 percent GDP growth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=168.04s)]
*  He crashed it and you can see it right there in the chart how he crashed it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=170.6s)]
*  That's why you got to fact check what they say. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=174.88s)]
*  Then Laura Ingraham continued this theme. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=177.08s)]
*  Trump's fixing Biden's chaos. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=180.08s)]
*  And she watched what they do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=183.72s)]
*  Look at the Chiron. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=185.28s)]
*  They always try to flip what's really happening into their dystopian or wellian framing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=186.28s)]
*  Watch this clip. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=192.92s)]
*  Trump's trying to clean up Biden's chaos and it ain't easy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=194.48s)]
*  And on top of that, Trump's trying to reset the American economy after decades of economic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=199.16s)]
*  chaos forced on our working class. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  Of course, the media's understanding of all of this is very limited. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=206.48s)]
*  And frankly, at times sounds pretty condescending. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=210.76s)]
*  So then Fox brings on Donald Trump's chief propagandist, Caroline Leavitt, who's basically [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  The Trump version, I think a more ridiculous version of pink dress lady, the chief propagandist [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=219.44s)]
*  for North Korea. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=225.6s)]
*  As we wrote on the Midas Touch network account, I'm not sure if this is or isn't a real picture. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=227.68s)]
*  I'm just joking. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=232.32s)]
*  It's not a real picture, but it could be a real picture. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=233.32s)]
*  There's so much good news flowing out of this administration every day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  It's hard for the media to keep up with. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=238.16s)]
*  There are wins after wins every single week. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=240.06s)]
*  By the way, that's actually what she said. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=243.36s)]
*  She went on Sean Hannity's show and here's what she said. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=245.52s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=247.64s)]
*  So trust in President Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=248.64s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=250.92s)]
*  This is a proven economic formula. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=251.92s)]
*  What is he asking of Americans at this time? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  He talked about transition costs, transition problems. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Is he asking something specific for Americans to do? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  No, I think the president is asking for Americans trust in Trump, as I just said, trust in his [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  economic agenda and formula. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=268.4s)]
*  It's a proven formula that works. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=269.96s)]
*  And by the way, clearly American people do in fact trust him because they did just overwhelmingly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=271.52s)]
*  elect him to this office. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=277.12s)]
*  Here she is again. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=278.6s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here of Caroline Leavitt saying everyone's a rock star. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=279.6s)]
*  Win after win. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=283.12s)]
*  Everything's so great. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=284.2s)]
*  Here to play this clip. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=285.2s)]
*  The president invited the press into the meeting where he went around the table and instructed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=286.2s)]
*  each and every one of his cabinet secretaries to provide an honest update about what they [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=291.54s)]
*  are doing at their respective agencies. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=297.04s)]
*  And every cabinet secretary is a rock star. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=299.68s)]
*  They are passionate about the issues they are leading on and they are delivering on [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=302.22s)]
*  exactly what President Trump called upon them to do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=306.28s)]
*  There is so much good news flowing out of this administration every day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=309.68s)]
*  It's definitely hard for the media to keep up with. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=314.0s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely outrageous, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=316.92s)]
*  You know, maybe you started your business because it was your passion, but then somehow [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  you found yourself deep in spreadsheets, payroll forms and onboarding emails. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=322.12s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=326.56s)]
*  That's exactly how we felt running this podcast and the Midas Touch Network. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=327.56s)]
*  Nobody's an expert in every area, especially when it comes to HR. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=331.64s)]
*  That's why we are so excited about Bamboo HR and all in one solution that actually gives [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=334.8s)]

*  And then Sean Hannity, who again, why I call it state regime media is that they are an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=391.46s)]
*  arm of the regime, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=397.32s)]
*  That's what Fox is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=399.84s)]
*  So Sean Hannity gets his message from the regime and he's fed the talking point to feed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=400.96s)]
*  to Caroline Levitt. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=407.9s)]
*  And that's what he does. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=409.5s)]
*  He goes, I hear you're doing a deal and this is going to be a great deal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=410.5s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=413.34s)]
*  Is that as a result of the president saying it's either going to be free or fair trade [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=414.34s)]
*  or reciprocal tariffs. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=419.14s)]
*  They all want to come to the table. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=421.14s)]
*  They all want to deal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  And I'm told that deal number one is close to being finished. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=426.82s)]
*  It is true. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=427.82s)]
*  We believe that there could be some several deals very soon. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=430.46s)]
*  More than 75 countries have reached out to the administration. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=434.38s)]
*  More than 15 offers are on the table and the president's trade team and the president himself [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=438.18s)]
*  are working very hard to negotiate tailor made trade deals with every country that has [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  reached out. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=449.78s)]
*  No other president has had the courage to fully use the leverage of the United States [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=450.9s)]
*  of America, not just our economic might, but our military and national security might as [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=456.14s)]
*  well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=461.94s)]
*  And again, so utterly pathetic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=462.94s)]
*  I'm going to show you one more clip of Caroline Levitt and then I will not show you any others [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=464.29999999999995s)]
*  right now because I can't tolerate it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=467.85999999999996s)]
*  But I got a fact check and I got to show you what they're doing right here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=469.78s)]
*  Here Caroline Levitt's like our phones are ringing off the hook as countries are calling [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=473.9s)]
*  us play this clip. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=478.82s)]
*  Now the rest of the world is calling our administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=480.44s)]
*  The phones are ringing off the hook because they need the United States of America, not [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=483.6s)]
*  just our economy and our market, but they need us to continue providing peace around [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=488.12s)]
*  this world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  And they know that they are indebted to us for the stability that we have provided in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  their own countries for decades. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=497.68s)]
*  And the president has made that very clear that the American people are finally going [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=499.88s)]
*  to have the front seat at the table and thank God for it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=504.44s)]
*  Remember what Donald Trump said, why he's doing this? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=509.0s)]
*  He said he was doing this because he wants countries to kiss his ass. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=511.64s)]
*  Remember that's what he said when he was speaking before the National Republican Congressional [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=515.6s)]
*  Committee, the NRC. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=519.88s)]
*  Remember he was doing that dinner and he was everyone's calling me to kiss my ass. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=520.88s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=525.2s)]
*  The authoritarian playbook, break the economic order down, create disorder, create suffering [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=526.4s)]
*  here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=532.08s)]
*  Make corporations beg you for exemptions. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=533.08s)]
*  Make people beg you for breadcrumbs and handouts. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=535.0s)]
*  Make the world come and beg you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=538.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you what's happening. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=539.28s)]
*  The resistance and opposition here in the United States is growing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=540.56s)]
*  Corporate America is getting very pissed at Donald Trump finally. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=544.3s)]
*  And we're seeing countries across the world unite with each other, forming alliances that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=547.52s)]
*  isolate and alienate the United States, viewing the U.S. as this pariah state, a weirder version [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=551.96s)]
*  of North Korea that still has a lot of economic power based on its history, but is volatile. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=558.36s)]
*  That's why you see the 10 and 30 year treasury yields going up. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=565.44s)]
*  Our notes are not worth a lot anymore like they used to because people see it's an incredibly [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  volatile market based on the whims of an authoritarian leader in Donald Trump and an idiot one at [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=573.44s)]
*  that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=580.0400000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany right here, Donald Trump's former press secretary. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  She is a host on Fox. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  And again, this is the type of North Korea style crap that you see. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=591.36s)]
*  China was taking advantage of us and look at where we are. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=592.44s)]
*  We finally have someone in the White House saying enough is enough. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=596.12s)]
*  And it happens to be the guy who authored the art of the deal. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=599.36s)]
*  I'm going to peg my money on the guy authoring the art of the deal. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=603.0s)]
*  And to Mark Levin's point, he said, maybe this will be a great reset. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=606.52s)]
*  Like when we took down the Soviet Union during the Reagan years and we did it economically. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe to Mark Levin's point, that is what Donald Trump is doing economically with China. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=615.88s)]
*  I'm going to put my money on the art of the deal guy and good job. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=620.2s)]
*  And then on that same morning show, they then have all of their hosts glaze Elon Musk. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=624.24s)]
*  Where's the thank you? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=628.76s)]
*  We should be praising him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=630.24s)]
*  Please, let's thank him. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=632.12s)]
*  This is what this is exactly. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  This is crazier than what you see in North Korea. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=635.96s)]
*  Let me refresh. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  Let me reflect on that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  It's crazier. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=641.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=642.2s)]
*  Cheryl, talk to me about the attention that the left is placing on what seems to me a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=643.2s)]
*  misplaced target. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=647.76s)]
*  So they're obsessed now with getting Elon Musk out of there after the 130 days that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=648.64s)]
*  you can only work per 365 with no attention paid to the astronomical figures. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=652.8s)]
*  I read the ridiculousness of who we've been paying in the form of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=658.08s)]
*  Why is there no attention on that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=663.64s)]
*  And a thank you given to Elon Musk. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  How about a thank you for the transparency that he and the Doge team have put out there? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=667.36s)]
*  You can go onto the website right now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=670.8s)]
*  They've got a live tracker for Doge and it shows dollar per dollar how much they have [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=672.28s)]
*  saved the American taxpayer. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=676.88s)]
*  That is you, America. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  This is volunteer work being done by the world's richest man. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=679.92s)]
*  And then they criticize Governor Walz for criticizing Elon Musk. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=684.0s)]
*  The audacity. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=688.92s)]
*  How do you criticize Elon Musk? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=690.08s)]
*  One of our dear leaders as well here play this clip. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=692.0s)]
*  Which is the audacity of Governor Walz to single out Elon Musk as like a bad billionaire. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=694.72s)]
*  When we talk about contributions to society, he's done nothing but help this society. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=702.04s)]
*  Medical developments, rescuing astronauts and more. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=707.0s)]
*  And yet George Soros, for example, a billionaire that has led directly to the destruction of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=709.76s)]
*  society deaths. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=714.88s)]
*  And yet that's who Walz is calling to demonize. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=715.96s)]
*  And then they bring on Jameson Greer. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  Jameson Greer is the top US trade representative. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  And he's asked this question about the question is they say tariffs are going to cost the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=726.6s)]
*  American household forty eight hundred. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  What do you say to those households that are now going to be taxed because Trump's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=735.92s)]
*  tariffs are taxes? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=740.4s)]
*  Here's what Jameson Greer says. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=741.7199999999999s)]
*  You're playing this clip. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=743.4s)]
*  Companies. But in the meantime, they say it's going to cost the American household [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=744.4s)]
*  four thousand eight hundred dollars. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you say to those households? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would say with respect to those projections, a lot of those are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  Wall Street analysts who have a lot to lose themselves. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  In the first term, we put a lot of tariffs on China and we saw similar predictions. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=759.4s)]
*  Those ended up being wrong. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=763.16s)]
*  Inflation went down. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the economic fundamentals of our of our of our country are still very, very [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  good. And while there may be an adjustment, I think we're going to be on a good path. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=771.08s)]
*  And I don't think we're going to see that level of increase in household expenses. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=774.48s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of countries are still at 10 percent. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=778.52s)]
*  So many of those products maybe we can buy from other countries. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=781.04s)]
*  And by the way, that data comes from the Yale Budget Lab. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=784.2s)]
*  It doesn't come from Wall Street. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  It comes from the Yale Budget Lab, which, by the way, if you watch some of the other [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=790.64s)]
*  videos I've done, that's one of the reasons they attack Yale. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=794.2s)]
*  Fake data, fake news. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=797.2s)]
*  Everything's fake. You can't believe anything other than what dear leader Donald Trump [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=798.36s)]
*  says. But by the way, Jameson Greer, our tariffs, if tariffs are great, then why [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  are you pausing some of them? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=809.2s)]
*  If tariffs are bad, then why are you still implementing some of it? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=811.44s)]
*  There's no consistency at all because it is there. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=816.4000000000001s)]
*  There's no even ideology. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=820.24s)]
*  It's the honestly that Donald Trump is a malignant, narcissistic head case and he's [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=822.32s)]
*  got issues and he doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=828.64s)]
*  And they're entertaining the whims of like a crazy person who's out there just [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=831.44s)]
*  thinking about his own ego and how it's going to benefit him. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=836.84s)]
*  And he's like, oh, maybe I could make money if it dips. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=839.88s)]
*  Maybe I should say bye bye bye and then go. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=842.72s)]
*  It's based on nothing but sheer lunacy and Donald Trump's greed to enrich himself. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=845.48s)]
*  That's it. That's the motivation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=851.56s)]
*  It's the lunacy of his greed, his desire to have people kiss his ass and lunacy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPuwlOa-rxU&t=853.28s)]
