# SECRET Videos of Trump Dinner EXPOSES EVENT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc)
*  So, Donald Trump tried to keep his meme coin dinner on Thursday private. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=0.0s)]
*  He wanted to keep it all shrouded in secrecy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=5.8s)]
*  He didn't want to reveal the list of the individuals who attended. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=8.88s)]
*  Well, guess what, Donald? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=12.76s)]
*  We here at the Midas Touch Network, despite you closing this event to the press, we got [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  videos and photos of what went down at the meme coin dinner that you're not going to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=18.96s)]
*  see anywhere else. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=24.6s)]
*  And we went deep. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=26.88s)]
*  I can show you the food that was served, the steak, the salad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=28.04s)]
*  I can show you the Trump meme coin leadership board where the people were shown which status [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  they get in terms of preferred access to Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=38.2s)]
*  I can show you the types of things that Trump was saying at this event using the seal of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=42.64s)]
*  the United States presidency, despite the fact that Donald Trump's press secretary, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=47.84s)]
*  Caroline Leavitt, said this event is being held in Donald Trump's personal time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=53.0s)]
*  So, let's just rewind for a little bit here and remind you what this event was. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=57.6s)]
*  The top 220 meme coin holders of Trump's worthless meme coin got this invite to Donald Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  golf course in Virginia where they got access to Donald Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=72.02s)]
*  On the low end, a meme coin holder who was invited paid about a million dollars on average [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=76.44s)]
*  to attend this event. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=83.28s)]
*  Some of the meme coin holders paid upwards of 20 or 30 million dollars to be at this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=85.0s)]
*  event and to get that access with Donald Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=91.72s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump and his press secretary, Caroline Leavitt, his chief propagandist, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=95.32s)]
*  said Donald Trump was attending this event on his, quote, personal time while he was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=100.44s)]
*  using the presidential seal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=104.68s)]
*  He was using Marine Force One. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=106.72s)]
*  He was using the presidential motorcade. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=109.66s)]
*  So, he was using all of the indicia and all of the trappings of the presidency. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's take a look just even what was served. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  This is the steak that was served. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=123.8s)]
*  It looks absolutely gross. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Even the meme coin holders who are paying a million dollars got gross looking steak. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=127.6s)]
*  And you can even see it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that carrots on there? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it looks like the worst of the worst type of dinner that you get at like a wedding, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=134.32s)]
*  but like the bad kind. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know, the kind that I'm talking about. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  People also got a goodie bag filled with one hat, a fight, fight, fight hat with an image [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=143.2s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  This is the gross looking salad that was served here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  You see Marine Force One right there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=153.64s)]
*  Trump used metal detectors to ensure his crypto guests were disarmed before going into what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=155.76s)]
*  was referred to as a gun free and press free zone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=160.88s)]
*  Yes, we got photos of some of the people who attended. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=164.56s)]
*  Press crypto event posing next to a fight, fight, fight board. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=168.88s)]
*  You can see the quality control on Trump's crypto cards being pretty low. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=173.48s)]
*  You see cracks in it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=178.44s)]
*  Everything that Donald Trump does is absolutely cheap. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  In this next photo, you see some of the guests who attended this meme coin crypto dinner. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=183.1s)]
*  And you can see behind them where Donald Trump spoke. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=189.32s)]
*  You can see the presidential seal right there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=192.62s)]
*  Donald Trump spoke at this closed door crypto event and he derangely, delusionally tells [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=195.6s)]
*  the crowd the country is doing great. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=202.48s)]
*  We have zero inflation, he said. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  He says oil is a dollar ninety eight a gallon and we have zero inflation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=207.64s)]
*  This is what he said during his speech. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=212.42s)]
*  Again, I don't think you're going to see this video elsewhere. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=214.2s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=217.56s)]
*  The country is doing really well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=218.56s)]
*  We have no inflation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=219.92s)]
*  Costs are way down. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=220.92s)]
*  Oil just was a one ninety nine, one ninety eight a gallon, which you haven't seen in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=223.52s)]
*  years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=229.0s)]
*  Now, during his closed press crypto event, Trump also pretended to be hit in the ear [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=230.0s)]
*  after an unexpected loud sound was heard here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=238.34s)]
*  Did you know that just before the election, they went all crypto? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=239.34s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Because they know they can do that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's one of Trump's crypto investors entering into Trump's Virginia golf course wearing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=247.64s)]
*  a mask. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=272.28s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=273.28s)]

*  This is as Trump's motorcade came into the event. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=290.5s)]
*  You can see it right here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=293.73999999999995s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=294.88s)]
*  Now one of the attendees who actually purchased the highest value amount of the worthless [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=310.68s)]
*  Trump mean coin is a guy named Justin Sun. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=317.4s)]
*  to be a Chinese crypto billionaire who bought over 18 million dollars of Trump's coin starting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=323.44s)]
*  in January. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=329.26s)]
*  As the Citizens for Ethics Groups explains, the SEC charged him for market manipulation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=330.86s)]
*  fraud before the Trump regime took power. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=336.2s)]
*  The DOJ was investigating him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=339.62s)]
*  He invested in the Trump backed crypto venture. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=341.88s)]
*  The SEC paused its case. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=345.1s)]
*  Then he went to Trump's crypto dinner as the top holder of the Trump mean coin. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=347.36s)]
*  We can see that Justin Sun was presented with an award. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=353.48s)]
*  Looks like he was given a Trump watch right there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=358.48s)]
*  You can see Justin Sun holding the Trump watch. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=362.16s)]

*  Once again, you'll see the presidential seal right there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  And then Donald Trump tried to impress the crowd by saying, oh, did you like the helicopter? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=508.62s)]
*  Did you like the Marine Force One? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=513.6s)]
*  I was in here. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=515.04s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=516.12s)]
*  Did you get to see the helicopters? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=522.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=524.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=525.12s)]
*  Super cool. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=526.12s)]
*  Good seeing you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=527.12s)]
*  I don't see a lot of windows here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=528.12s)]
*  How do you like this location? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=530.12s)]
*  I want to remind you what Democratic Senator Murphy had to say about this event because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=534.0s)]
*  I think he put things in perspective nicely. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=540.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=543.04s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=544.04s)]
*  Donald Trump will have a secret dinner and meeting with the 200 individuals who have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=545.04s)]
*  spent the most money buying up his meme coin. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's meme coin has no value in and of itself. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=556.56s)]
*  Its only value is based upon how much demand exists for the meme coin. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=560.88s)]
*  He creates demand by essentially opening a channel for bribery. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=566.0s)]
*  If you buy his coin, the price goes up and he makes more money. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=572.2s)]
*  If you buy his coin, you get secret access to the president to be able to plead your [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=577.64s)]
*  case, to be able to ask for preferential treatment. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=583.2s)]
*  And the extra benefit is no one will ever know that you bought the coin or that you [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=587.68s)]
*  got the private access. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=593.08s)]
*  And so it provides cover for the most corrupt, for the most compromised, for the worst of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=595.92s)]
*  the worst to channel money to Donald Trump in order to get their private audience with [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=603.04s)]
*  him in order to plead their case for favorable treatment from the federal government or for [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=609.0s)]
*  investment from the U.S. taxpayer. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  And just to remind you, this is what Caroline Levitt said, that this was supposed to be [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  in Donald Trump's personal time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  But as you saw in this video with the footage that we have, you can see the presidential [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=625.7s)]
*  seal right there. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=630.1800000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip of Caroline Levitt. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=631.1800000000001s)]
*  Caroline, you guys are very proud of your record on transparency. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=632.9000000000001s)]
*  I have two transparency related questions for you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=635.7s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight, will the White House commit to making a list of the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=638.5400000000001s)]
*  attendees public so people can see who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=642.38s)]
*  Well, as you know, Gareth, this question has been raised with the president. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=647.1800000000001s)]
*  I have also addressed the dinner tonight. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=650.86s)]
*  The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=652.64s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=656.24s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=657.68s)]
*  But certainly I can raise that question and try to get you an answer for it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=659.8199999999999s)]
*  And I want to give a hat tip right here to Jessica Tarlov on Fox, who brought the receipts [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=663.04s)]
*  and brought the facts about this meme coin event. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=668.24s)]
*  And you'll see Greg Gutfeld and the other Fox hosts immediately clench down and try [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=671.68s)]
*  to basically yell at her and talk over her and act like sociopaths to try to stop any [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=677.7s)]
*  discussions about this meme coin event here. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=687.3000000000001s)]
*  And Greg mentioned a staggering level of corruption. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=688.3000000000001s)]
*  And I just got a note that the staggering level of corruption from last night's meme [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=691.6s)]
*  coin dinner. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  That's what you're focusing on. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  40% of Donald Trump's wealth has been accumulated since he became president because of two crypto [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=700.1800000000001s)]
*  coins. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=706.1s)]
*  The New York Times did interviews with foreign buyers of this cryptocurrency who came over [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=707.5s)]
*  here to have dinner with him. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=711.38s)]
*  A guy from South Korea. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=712.74s)]
*  This is not even part of the segment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=714.0600000000001s)]
*  So what? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=716.58s)]
*  You're talking about a meme coin. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=717.58s)]
*  No, I'm talking about who's corrupt and who is profiting off the American office. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=718.58s)]
*  Did he try to cover that up? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=723.22s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=724.62s)]
*  Yeah, Caroline Levitt said it was his personal time. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=725.62s)]
*  You're defending an administration that covered up a dying leader and you're sitting here [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=726.62s)]
*  going, but meme coin, meme coin. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=732.94s)]
*  I've seen billions of dollars. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=735.82s)]
*  Let's give Paul a chance to clean it up real quick. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=737.82s)]
*  Paul, final thoughts. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=740.14s)]
*  It is clean on my side of the screen. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=741.14s)]
*  I just want to let everybody know how unprecedented this is. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=743.14s)]
*  That Donald Trump is using the Oval Office to sell personal meme coins. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=746.98s)]
*  As you heard Jessica Tarlov explain, most of Donald Trump's wealth comes from the sale [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  of meme coins now. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=756.58s)]
*  Trump Media stock, despite the fact that Trump Media hasn't made a profit. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=758.86s)]
*  Not only that, it loses hundreds of millions of dollars and its revenue annually, less [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=765.3s)]
*  than four million dollars, annual revenue. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=771.74s)]
*  Not talking about profit, no profit. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=774.9399999999999s)]
*  Lost hundreds of millions of dollars and it loses tens of millions of dollars each quarter [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=776.6999999999999s)]
*  right now on a going forward basis. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=781.18s)]
*  That's where Trump's getting his wealth from and they want to act like it's his personal [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=784.14s)]
*  time. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=789.36s)]
*  Go back and watch the video I did though on this claim that this is Donald Trump's personal [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=790.36s)]
*  time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=794.26s)]
*  I said it's actually a good thing that she claims it's personal time in the sense of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=795.26s)]
*  the Supreme Court's absolute immunity ruling says that anything that a former president [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=799.66s)]
*  does or a president does on their personal time is not subject to the horrific absolute [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=804.66s)]
*  immunity ruling that the Supreme Court made. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=810.74s)]
*  And by calling it personal time was Caroline Levitt waiving Donald Trump's ability to claim [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=813.7199999999999s)]
*  immunity for any of the conduct that was taking place. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=819.52s)]
*  But we got pretty good footage of everything that was going on there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=823.4799999999999s)]
*  Our research team was looking to see what was taking place. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNMYBIbvvfc&t=827.92s)]
