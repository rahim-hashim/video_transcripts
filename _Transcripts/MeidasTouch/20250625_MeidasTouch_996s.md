# Fox News COLLAPSES ON AIR as Trump WAR FAILURE EXPOSED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4)
*  Uh-oh, state regime media known as Fox was collapsing live on air yesterday after it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=0.0s)]
*  was revealed that Donald Trump's strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities were not as [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=6.44s)]
*  successful as Donald Trump claimed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=12.32s)]
*  The Trump regime claimed that the nuclear sites were, quote, completely obliterated. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  We now learn from a damage assessment by the United States intelligence community, which [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=20.3s)]
*  was leaked first to CNN, then to the New York Times, that the strikes on these Iranian nuclear [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=26.24s)]
*  facilities indeed caused damage, but they did not destroy the facilities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  Also, Iran likely was able to move out about 880 pounds of uranium before Donald Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=37.76s)]
*  conducted the strikes based on Donald Trump telegraphing when the strikes were going to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=45.36s)]
*  take place. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  So Iran is withdrawing any further cooperation from the IAEA, and the Trump regime now is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=51.88s)]
*  trying to claim that denuclearization was actually never their objective from the outset. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=58.88s)]
*  So let me show you how Fox state regime media was trying to deal with this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=64.72s)]
*  You had Jesse Waters spring on MAGA Republican Ted Cruz, and Ted Cruz basically says this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=70.2s)]
*  was actually all just a massive CNN liberal conspiracy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=75.88s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=80.6s)]
*  Why do you think CNN would do this? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=81.72s)]
*  You know, look, I think it's who they are. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=84.24s)]
*  CNN and much of the corporate media, Donald Trump broke them and they're just that they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  have panels together discuss is Donald Trump the devil or is he Adolf Hitler? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=95.08s)]
*  That's just where they are. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=100.08s)]
*  It's why nobody watches them anymore because because it's just, you know, it's just who [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  they are. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=108.24s)]
*  And I think people are frustrated. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=110.04s)]
*  We know that they hate the president and it's look, they're an extension. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=111.56s)]
*  They are the left wing of the Democrat Party and the Democrat Party right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=115.64s)]
*  They have no positive agenda for the country. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=120.24s)]
*  They are a party of anger and hate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=122.88s)]
*  They hate the president. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=125.04s)]
*  We just saw an incredible military strike that successfully took out Iran's nuclear [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=126.12s)]
*  weapons capability. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=132.04s)]
*  And what are the Democrats doing this week? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=133.04s)]
*  They're voting on trying to disapprove President Trump defending America. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=135.44s)]
*  Then you had MAGA Republican Senator Mullen and he said, you know, look, this leak is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=139.84s)]
*  premature, but it's also false. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  But they leaked a lie. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not really sure I'm following this other than it doesn't make sense at all because [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=151.36s)]
*  they haven't got their talking points straight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=158.12s)]
*  I need to clarify. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=159.12s)]
*  The Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=160.12s)]
*  So the Defense Department, they don't have eyes on this like our IC community does. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=163.56s)]
*  It was a premature leak and without question, it needs to be investigated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=168.52s)]
*  This kind of information cannot be leaked because you have fake news like CNN running [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  with the story and it's absolutely false. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=176.84s)]
*  They were salivating. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Then you have Donald Trump's envoy to Russia, this guy named Steve Witkoff, who had never [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=180.52s)]
*  been any type of ambassador before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  He was like a New York real estate guy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=188.0s)]
*  So he goes on Laura Ingraham and he tries to act like an expert on leaks and that, you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  know, leaking this type of information, whoever leaked this information about the military [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=196.52s)]
*  strikes probably committed treason. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  Who told you about that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=204.12s)]
*  Vladimir Putin? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=205.12s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=206.12s)]
*  It's being used in the media and it's all over today that, aha, Trump said it was obliterated, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  but it's not obliterated. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  It's set back months, but not it's not over from Iran's nuclear programs perspective. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Your reaction to that and I assume you know what we're talking about with this leaked [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=224.52s)]
*  intel report. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, it goes without saying that leaking that type of information, whatever the information, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  whatever side it comes out on is outrageous. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=238.36s)]
*  It's treasonous. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=241.12s)]
*  So it ought to be investigated and whoever did it, whoever is responsible for it should [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=242.12s)]
*  be held accountable. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=248.08s)]
*  It could hurt lives in the future. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=249.9s)]
*  Leaking is a completely unacceptable thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=253.2s)]
*  By the way, one observation that I have is who won if there was a winner regarding Donald [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=255.4s)]
*  Trump's strikes in Iran? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=262.84s)]
*  I mean, the clear winner is Russia. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=264.36s)]
*  You could potentially also argue Iran, but just think about it right here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=266.88s)]
*  You have Iran provides Russia with the Shaheed drones that Russia uses to attack innocent [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=271.8s)]
*  civilians in Ukraine and uses in their invasion in Ukraine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=279.32s)]
*  Donald Trump had been posting messages that he wants Iran to start trading with China [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  and giving China cheap oil. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=291.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is now saying that the goal was what not denuclearization and now Donald Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  wants there to be a ceasefire after striking the nuclear facilities, but not destroying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=299.96s)]
*  them and allowing Iran to quickly build a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  All of that kind of points to Russia being the winner based on their alliance with Iran, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=313.36s)]
*  but that may just be me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  Here Steve Witkoff says it was never going to be war for war's sake. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=319.68s)]
*  Tell me if you even know what he's talking about here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=326.36s)]
*  You know, Laura, I listened to your introduction and you've got it right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=327.36s)]
*  So many people had it wrong about the president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  He had an objective. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=334.16s)]
*  He wouldn't have entered the war, entered this 12 day as he calls it war without that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=335.72s)]
*  objective. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=340.16s)]
*  The objective was to eliminate enrichment in Iran and weaponization capability on the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=341.48s)]
*  part on the part of Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=348.04s)]
*  And he achieved his objective and he achieved it after 12 days. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  And so it was never going to be a forever war. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  It was never going to be a war just for war's sake. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=356.68s)]
*  It was a war to achieve an objective that I think most Americans should be very, very [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=360.12s)]
*  satisfied with. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=366.64s)]
*  I can tell you that I was in those discussions. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=368.12s)]
*  I watched our commander in chief. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=370.64s)]
*  He is, he's got this uncanny ability to understand exactly when to push the button and when to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  pull out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=380.4s)]
*  He achieved his objective and that was the end of it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=382.0s)]
*  This next clip, I'll just say the following. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=384.32s)]
*  Don Jr. is living proof that this is not the case. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=386.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=389.64s)]
*  He is, he's got this uncanny ability to understand exactly when to push the button and when to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=390.64s)]
*  pull out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=397.52s)]
*  Then you have Jesse Waters, one of the top Fox propagandists. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=398.52s)]
*  He says that migrants should be sent to Greenland. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=403.28s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=406.56s)]
*  Jesse, you're saying that you thought they should all just go to Guantanamo Bay earlier [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=407.56s)]
*  and just live down there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=411.08s)]
*  No, that's too expensive. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=412.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=413.08s)]
*  They came from China or they came from Africa. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=414.08s)]
*  That flight is a fortune. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  Why should we have to pay all the fuel costs? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=418.08s)]
*  So I say we sent them to Greenland because it's shorter and it's cold. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  And most of these third world migrants don't like the cold. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=426.0s)]
*  So you put them in an island, they can't escape. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=428.76s)]
*  And it gives us leverage over Denmark when we try to annex the beautiful island. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=431.2s)]
*  So you ever put on a shirt and instantly feel like you've got your whole life together? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=435.84s)]
*  That's exactly what happened when I tried true classic. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  And I mean actually fit. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=443.36s)]
*  They're snug in the chest and shoulders looser in the midsection and the fabric soft, breathable, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=444.92s)]
*  zero stiffness. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm wearing mine right now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=451.12s)]

*  Notice over here how Fox deals with Donald Trump using the F word when Donald Trump earlier [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  yesterday morning just started cursing out Israel and Iran and say these F-ers, they [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=498.74s)]
*  don't know what they're doing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  But for Donald Trump, it was salty language but shows his power. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  When it comes to Jasmine Crockett, Fox says what a what a foul mouth she has. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  The president feeling very frustrated this morning and using some salty language as he [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=516.06s)]
*  lashed out at both countries. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=520.3s)]
*  They don't know what the **** they're doing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=522.38s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=524.46s)]
*  But it looks like the F-bomb diplomacy worked. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=525.46s)]
*  Guys, I was particularly repulsed by Rep. Jasmine Crockett's comments where she said, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=529.38s)]
*  I'm the one that's supposed to make the F-ing decision on bombing Iran. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=535.66s)]
*  And it reinforced to me why that's exactly not the case. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=540.2199999999999s)]
*  We know that constitutionally that indeed it was reserved for the commander in chief [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=544.3s)]
*  for that reason that we see and at the time commander in chief of the army and Navy, but [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  for that reason that that's the person elected by the people that we entrust those decisions [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=552.9s)]
*  to. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=556.78s)]
*  It's a pretty foul mouth of her for someone that went to a tidy little all girls Catholic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=557.78s)]
*  school. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=561.4599999999999s)]
*  But that's what we're seeing is all of these representatives lashing out trying to gain [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=562.4599999999999s)]
*  influence or attention and they're missing the whole point because they're not thinking [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=566.98s)]
*  about this critically or the gravitas that it deserves. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=569.98s)]
*  And then Fox just goes into its kind of full Kim Jong Un mode and says the real question [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=573.02s)]
*  we need to be asking is when's Donald Trump going to get his Nobel Prize? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=578.06s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=582.3399999999999s)]
*  Harold, the most serious question for you. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=583.3399999999999s)]
*  President Trump has been officially nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=585.98s)]
*  Do you agree that he's earned it? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=589.26s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=591.46s)]
*  I hope I hope I hope he gets it more from Jesse Waters, one of Fox's top propagandists [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=592.46s)]
*  here where he says that anybody who claims the bombs didn't work should be tried for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=597.22s)]
*  treason. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=604.1800000000001s)]
*  You're playing all right, Jesse, the media leak. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=605.1800000000001s)]
*  You gutless losers, the president said to CNN to the applause of millions of Americans. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=608.14s)]
*  And what do you make of this leak? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=612.54s)]
*  The New York Times trying to downplay the effects. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=615.1s)]
*  Talk to us about the media landscape. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=618.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, they're saying the bombs don't work. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=619.54s)]
*  I mean, this was a 30,000 pound bomb. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=623.02s)]
*  If these bombs don't work, then you should try this guy who leaked it for treason because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=626.9s)]
*  it just tells the entire world, the people that don't have nukes, go to your nearest [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=632.74s)]
*  mountain range and start enriching uranium. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=636.66s)]
*  The United States can't do anything about it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  That's probably the most serious leak I've ever seen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=641.7s)]
*  Now, I don't even believe it because the person who wrote it is the same journalist who wrote [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=644.66s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop is Russia disinformation. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=651.02s)]
*  So to me, it sounds like another hoax. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=655.1s)]
*  Oh, by the way, last night they were also in meltdown mode on state regime media known [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=657.26s)]
*  as Fox when Zoran Mamdani won the Democratic New York City mayoral primary watch. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=662.54s)]
*  How did he play this clip? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=670.26s)]
*  All right. Here with reaction. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=671.54s)]
*  Outkick founder Clay Travis. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=672.7s)]
*  All right. So if you want government control, grocery stores and rent control and socialism [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=674.18s)]
*  at a level we've never seen and wealth confiscation and basically chase anybody that makes any [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=681.34s)]
*  money out of New York, I bet it will be a mass exodus, the likes of which that city's [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=687.9399999999999s)]
*  never seen. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=693.06s)]
*  Sean, he's won according to the prediction markets right now. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=695.02s)]
*  Literally five seconds ago, I was checking right before we came on. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=698.7s)]
*  Ninety nine percent chance this guy is going to win the Democrat nomination to be the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=702.74s)]
*  next mayor of New York. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=708.1s)]
*  Yeah. And this was on Hannity to watch his guest here play this clip. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=709.3000000000001s)]
*  This guy said that he would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu for crimes against human rights if [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=712.82s)]
*  he came to visit New York City. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=720.14s)]
*  This is what this guy said. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=722.14s)]
*  This guy said he wants to replace police officers with social workers, Sean. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=723.66s)]
*  If you need help because you need the NYPD, this guy says, no, no, no, we're going to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=729.7s)]
*  send you a social worker instead. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=734.82s)]
*  This is a disaster, maybe unbelievably worse than Chicago, worse than L.A. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=737.34s)]
*  New York City is on the cusp of electing the worst mayor that they have ever chose. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=744.14s)]
*  Bill de Blasio. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=749.98s)]
*  People are going to be wishing that he was the guy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=751.34s)]
*  And just so I appropriately fact check everything that you just saw there on Fox, I want to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=753.7s)]
*  just show you these clips as well. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=759.98s)]
*  This was Donald Trump from about, what, a week and a half ago at this point, maybe two [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=762.02s)]
*  weeks ago or so where he had the Juventus Football Club, the soccer players behind him, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=765.9s)]
*  which was a very odd staging as he was talking about the objectives that he wanted to see [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=772.34s)]
*  in Iran. This is before the US struck Iran. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=777.34s)]
*  And Donald Trump says we're not looking for a ceasefire, we're looking for a complete [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=780.2199999999999s)]
*  and total victory, which he says is denuclearization. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=785.26s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=788.66s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron of France the other day, the G7. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=789.38s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=793.02s)]
*  Look, he said I was going back home to make a ceasefire, not a ceasefire. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=793.9s)]
*  We'll long be on ceasefire. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=801.3s)]
*  And I said, why do you say that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=803.54s)]
*  Why would you say ceasefire? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=805.78s)]
*  It's a bad term to use because a ceasefire means like everything's going swimmingly. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=806.98s)]
*  We'll take a little time off. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=811.26s)]
*  It's not. We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=812.4200000000001s)]
*  We're looking for a total complete victory. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=814.78s)]
*  Again, you know what the victory is? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=817.66s)]
*  No nuclear weapon. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=819.98s)]
*  I thought it was a very badly worded statement by him. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=823.4200000000001s)]
*  And obviously I let him know that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=826.02s)]
*  And just so you can see how full of it they are, here's Maga Republican Congress [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=827.62s)]
*  member Turner, one of the top people on the Intelligence Committee for the Maga [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=832.22s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=836.42s)]
*  And he says it was never the objective to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  That was never our goal. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=842.66s)]
*  Literally, that's all you were saying. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=844.38s)]
*  Your goal. What was the goal then? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=846.14s)]
*  Was the goal just to bomb for the sake of bombing? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=848.42s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=851.0999999999999s)]
*  But then let's go to the next step is that we have this headline that CNN is reporting [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=851.8199999999999s)]
*  with the headline says U.S. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=857.3s)]
*  bombs did not destroy Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=859.3399999999999s)]
*  Early Intel suggests. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=864.62s)]
*  What's what's troubling about that headline and Phil, let's let's try to get us all back [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=866.5799999999999s)]
*  on track here is that that headline is not fake news, but it's it's not news because [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=871.06s)]
*  the administration did not say that the bombs destroyed Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=877.5s)]
*  I have in front of me the president's statement and the president said that they had [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=884.26s)]
*  sent they had carried out massive precision strikes on three key nuclear [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=889.26s)]
*  facilities. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=895.74s)]
*  And then another Maga Republican congress member, McCall, who is the chairman of the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=896.66s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=902.14s)]
*  So, you know, these are the two kind of top foreign intelligence, foreign affairs people [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=903.38s)]
*  I'm showing you. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=907.62s)]
*  McCall says something similar and he goes, when I was briefed on this plan in the past, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=909.02s)]
*  we never wanted to destroy the nuclear facilities. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=914.1s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=917.26s)]
*  That's all you said you were doing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=918.14s)]
*  Trump says obliterated here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=919.62s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=921.26s)]
*  I'm interested to know your reaction to this, considering that President Trump has [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=921.98s)]
*  repeatedly said that the program was, quote, completely obliterated. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=928.5s)]
*  Well, it's unfortunate that intelligence gets leaked so quickly in this administration. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=932.7800000000001s)]

*  destroy these three facilities, but rather cause significant damage. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=956.26s)]
*  But it was always known to be a temporary setback where they could then rebuild the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=961.06s)]
*  centrifuges. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=965.54s)]
*  This thought it was important that I fact check to show you what it is and how insane [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=966.38s)]
*  it is, what the Maga Republicans are saying. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxt-Lnfc9_4&t=971.14s)]
