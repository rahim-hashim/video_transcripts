# Trump and Elon HATCH SCHEME as Elon VANISHES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec)
*  You know, it's like clockwork with these sociopaths. They never want to face the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=0.0s)]
*  consequences of their actions, and so they'll pretend that they're the victim. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=4.0s)]
*  I'm just going to have to sail into the sunset. We're seeing this with Elon Musk right now, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=9.68s)]
*  and frankly, it's absolutely pathetic. Don't buy what he is selling, quite literally. And also, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=14.8s)]
*  when it comes to this routine that he's doing, that he's somehow stepping away from the government, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=21.76s)]
*  and he's going back to sleeping on the factory floor, everybody. So that's the sob story that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=27.6s)]
*  Elon Musk is trying to sell the American people right now. I'm moving away from government. I'm [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=34.24s)]
*  not going to do any more political donations. I'm just going to fade into the background. I tried [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=39.92s)]
*  with Doge. I did my best. Elon Musk, you were still at Capitol Hill last week with the Congressional [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=45.28s)]
*  Energy and Commerce Committee, where you were talking about cutting Medicaid. You were with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=53.2s)]
*  Donald Trump in the Middle East, where you met with the leaders of the UAE and Qatar and Saudi [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=59.84s)]
*  Arabia. You were with Donald Trump in the Oval Office when South African President Ramaphosa [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  was there. There's literally nothing has changed other than the fact that you realize that your [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=74.16s)]
*  destruction of our government, the hostile takeover, the cruelty with which you've done [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=80.4s)]
*  everything, has made you one of the most detestable human beings in the United States and the world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Your cars and your other companies are suffering as a result, so you just want to pretend. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  You want to try to act like you're no longer involved with Doge or anything, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  and that you're just going back to Tesla. It's total BS, but it's all coordinated, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal article, angry Elon is back. That's good for Tesla. Now is the moment [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=108.96s)]
*  for Musk to channel his fury into executing on the company's long-promised pivot to driverless cars. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=116.24s)]
*  You want us to believe all of this crap? It's absolutely ridiculous. Here's what Elon Musk [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  just recently posted. He had his ex-account, he was calling himself Kecius Maximus, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=129.92s)]
*  and then he changed it back to Elon Musk. And Grok is his background to see, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=137.84s)]
*  see, I'm serious, everybody. I'm no longer Kecius Maximus. But here's what he posted. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=142.72s)]
*  I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=148.16s)]
*  Doge has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=154.88s)]
*  but the profligacy of the government means that only radical improvements in productivity [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  can save our country. In other words, you're just going to use a bunch of gibberish word salad, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=166.08s)]
*  big words, and be like, I tried, I saved us. That's where we are right now. He went from, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=171.36s)]
*  we're going to cut $2 trillion from the deficit to $1 trillion in the deficit to $500 million to $150 [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=178.56s)]
*  to we're actually adding to the deficit to, oh my God, we're adding $5 trillion to the deficit [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=187.84s)]
*  to, oh my God, we may be adding $20 trillion to the deficit. But now it's, I tried, I did my best. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=194.64s)]
*  I saved us for a few more years. No, you've absolutely made things worse. You made things [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=201.6s)]
*  much worse. Then you have other posts from Elon Musk like this because he's trying to make us feel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  bad for him. He's trying to make us feel like he's got to go back to the factory to work after [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  destroying our federal government. Let me be very clear also. Doge was never about efficiency. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=220.32s)]
*  It was never about cutting the deficit. It was always about one thing, stealing your data, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=227.12s)]
*  taking your social security information, taking your medical records, getting all of the data [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  aggregated with Elon Musk's crew, Mr. Big Balls or whatever they call themselves. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=240.48s)]
*  And once they did that, that's all they really gave a crap about. And the destruction was the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  point. They destroyed it all. There's no efficiency. It's not efficient now that in FEMA, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=253.6s)]
*  there's very little staff there who can actually respond to emergencies. It's not efficient that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  at the National Weather Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, there aren't [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=266.64s)]
*  people who can predict the weather patterns and do the forecasting. It's not efficient when you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=271.84s)]
*  don't have people answering the phones at the Veteran Affairs Suicide Hotline. It's not efficient [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  when you're not helping 9-11 survivors and first responders. It's not efficient when you shut down [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=281.84s)]
*  the Department of Education and you steal school lunches from the mouths of low-income students. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not efficient when you kick people off of Medicaid. It's not efficient when the Federal [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=295.52s)]
*  Aviation Administration just made a total disaster of our airports with massive delays. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=300.08s)]
*  The radars in Newark and Denver are shutting down. The flights are incredibly dangerous. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Planes are crashing. There's nothing efficient. That's not what they were doing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=314.24s)]
*  He put the poison pill or the nuclear bomb, blew up the federal government, and now he just goes, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm going back to spending 24-7 on the factory floor, everybody. I'm not sure why I'm doing a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=325.12s)]
*  Mickey Mouse voice for that, but here's what he says. I'm not even sure if that was a Mickey [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=330.4s)]
*  Mouse voice. This is his real post from May 24th. So yesterday, back to spending 24-7 at work and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=333.76s)]
*  sleeping in conference server factory rooms, I must be super focused on X and XAI and Tesla, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=341.6s)]
*  plus Starship launch next week as we have critical technologies rolling out as evidenced by the X [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=348.48s)]
*  uptime issues this week. Major operational improvements need to be made. The failover [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=354.32s)]
*  redundancy should have worked, but it did not. Let's just take a look at where you've been, Elon. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=360.08s)]
*  As Mark Pocan points out, Elon Musk was back on Capitol Hill today. This was a few days ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Anyone actually believe he's stepping back? He's just hiding in the closet, but he's still in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=373.76s)]
*  room. Trump and Musk are doing everything to get tax cuts for themselves and ripping away your [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=378.72s)]
*  Medicaid and Medicare, even cutting healthcare for 14 million people and food assistance. That's what [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=384.24s)]
*  he was doing. The week before that, here's a photo of Elon Musk and MBS in Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=390.8s)]
*  Elon Musk took that trip. Of course, you know that Elon was in the room with South African [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  President Ramaphosa, so you see all of that. But Elon makes the Saab video. He makes the selfie [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=403.2s)]
*  Saab video and he goes, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=410.56s)]
*  I think I've done enough here. Play this clip right here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  I think I've done enough. Is it because of blowback? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=433.28s)]
*  Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=442.32s)]
*  I don't currently see a reason. What about- You're smart enough to know when something's not [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=446.24s)]
*  working, like when you can't focus at work or when you're dragging by 2 p.m. or when your stomach [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=451.52s)]
*  feels like it's fighting you after every meal. Well, here's the thing. These aren't random symptoms. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=456.64s)]
*  Your gut impacts everything from your digestion to your brain function to your energy levels. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=462.0s)]
*  That's why we love Just Thrive probiotic. Unlike other brands that make big promises but fall apart [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=467.76s)]
*  in your stomach, Just Thrive is the only probiotic clinically proven to arrive in your gut 100% [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=474.24s)]
*  alive. For you, that means real results, like better digestion, healthy immunity, and more [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=480.96s)]
*  energy to tackle your day. But don't just take our word for it. Try Just Thrive probiotic for [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=487.44s)]
*  90 days and see how much better you feel. If you don't notice a difference, they'll refund every [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=493.28s)]

*  Oh, Elon, we're supposed to feel so bad for you, so bad for you that you were what, giving away [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=516.88s)]
*  like a million dollars in different elections if people were like registered to vote. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=522.08s)]
*  I want to share this with you as well. Message from Democratic Congress member Greg Kassar who goes, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=529.28s)]
*  Elon Musk is not gone and we can't let Republicans pretend he is just because he's unpopular now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  We have to keep up the pressure until we actually fire Elon Musk. And you see Jake Sherman, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=543.36s)]
*  a Capitol Hill reporter, talked about how last week Elon Musk is on the Hill meeting with the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=549.04s)]
*  ENC Republicans, Energy and Commerce, on energy and AI. Notably, I think Medicaid is in there as [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=554.56s)]
*  well. The $880 billion cuts are in there as well. Now, this was Donald Trump on a plane recently [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=564.32s)]
*  when he was asked, would you appoint Elon to any other position? Here's what Donald Trump said. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  That was on April 3rd. This is on April 3rd as well. Even when Elon leaves, will Doge still be [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=594.32s)]
*  around was the question here. Play this clip. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  Doge, Doge yourself. Yeah. At some point, just so you understand, I know we're getting [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=624.96s)]
*  wrong. I want Elon to stay as long as possible. Number one, I like him. Number two, he's doing a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=630.88s)]
*  great job. Number three, he is a patron. That's why he's doing this. And he's, you know, it's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  very costly for him. But I want him to stay as long as possible. But there'll be a point where [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=641.6s)]
*  he's going to have to leave. And what he does, the secretaries will take totally over and Doge [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=648.4s)]
*  will stay active. We have a lot of smart people. A lot of those people, I believe are going to go [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=654.96s)]
*  into the agencies. So as I mentioned, Elon Musk is not going anywhere. Oh, here was Trump with [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  Ramaphosa pointing out that Elon, the South African president Ramaphosa pointing out that [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk was in the room here. Play this clip. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=674.16s)]
*  You know, now who do you, where do you think the ideas originating from that the white Afrikaners [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=704.16s)]
*  are given this without basically any paperwork at all, their citizenship path to citizenship [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=717.68s)]
*  is fast tracked into the United States. Who do you think is giving Donald Trump that information, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=725.52s)]
*  that the white South Africans are going through a genocide, which they're not in South Africa? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=730.32s)]
*  Now, there is gang violence in South Africa, it affects white people and black people around the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=736.32s)]
*  same proportion. If we're talking about white and black farmers as well. And it's a horrific thing [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=742.72s)]
*  that there's that gang violence and deaths of farmers in general, but it's not a white genocide [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=747.52s)]
*  taking place in South Africa. Where do you think that's? Where do you think that's, you know, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=753.28s)]
*  that's originating from? I want to give you just a few more data points before we go as well. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=758.64s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the MAGA Republicans will be adding somewhere between five to 20, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=764.56s)]
*  maybe even $30 trillion to the deficit. That's what we get with Elon Musk and Doge. I mean, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZafGolAcec&t=769.92s)]
