# PANICKED White House holds DISASTER Presser OVER WAR
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI)
*  Donald Trump's chief propagandist, Caroline Levitt, just held a disastrous press conference [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=0.0s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=5.72s)]
*  It's beyond parody. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=7.24s)]
*  So she read a statement from Donald Trump about the potential for America to go to war [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=9.16s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=15.4s)]
*  Do you know what she said? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=16.4s)]
*  She said Donald Trump will be deciding in two weeks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Yep, the old Donald Trump, two weeks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=22.44s)]
*  Give me two more weeks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=25.16s)]
*  Two weeks for this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=26.44s)]
*  Two weeks for that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=27.44s)]
*  Two weeks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=28.64s)]
*  This was the statement that she read play this clip. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=30.26s)]
*  Now regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=33.68s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision making and whether [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=38.56s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=42.6s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president and I quote, based on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=50.8s)]
*  with Iran in the near future. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=55.56s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=57.6s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=62.52s)]
*  So then a reporter asked her, you know, Donald Trump says two weeks about everything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=65.8s)]
*  He said two weeks he would decide if he would sanction Russia, two weeks to decide what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=72.56s)]
*  he was going to do with Ukraine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=78.2s)]
*  So how do we know that this two weeks is not just another made up two week thing by [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=80.72s)]
*  Donald Trump play this clip? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=87.24s)]
*  There's still a substantial chance is my question. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=89.0s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the reasoning and the rationale. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=91.16s)]
*  The president believes that, but that's his position and he will make a decision within [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=93.32s)]
*  the next two weeks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=96.8s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=97.8s)]
*  President Trump has said previously in regards to Russia, he's used this phrase about two [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=98.8s)]
*  weeks several times in terms of like, we expect like a two week deadline and then you get [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=104.16s)]
*  another two week deadline. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=109.2s)]
*  How can we be sure that he's going to stick to this one on making a decision on Iran? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=110.48s)]
*  Well, in those deadlines, as you've seen in respect to Russia, Ukraine, might I add, these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=114.72s)]
*  are two very different, complicated global conflicts, as you know, that the president [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  inherited from our previous incompetent president in the weakness of the previous administration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=123.16s)]
*  And the president has spent a tremendous amount of time and effort cleaning up these crises [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=128.72s)]
*  that were caused by the last administration's just complete dereliction of duty on the world [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=132.88s)]
*  stage in American weakness. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=137.68s)]
*  Now we have American strength again with respect to Russia and Ukraine because of that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=139.0s)]
*  American strength and the president's leadership. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=143.24s)]
*  We have seen these two sides engage in direct negotiations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=145.56s)]
*  And the last time the president said two weeks, you saw Russia and Ukraine have direct [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=148.96s)]
*  negotiations for the first time in years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=153.12s)]
*  And so the president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the problems and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=155.28s)]
*  the global conflicts in this world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=159.52s)]
*  Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=161.12s)]
*  He is the peace through strength president. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=163.28s)]
*  And so if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always going to grab it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=165.6s)]
*  But he's not afraid to use strength as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=168.72s)]
*  I will add. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=170.64s)]
*  How pathetic was that response? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  She goes immediately into attacking former President Biden. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And then she claims that Donald Trump saying two weeks about Russia led to some sort of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=179.68s)]
*  negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, which never took place as Russia continues to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=186.72s)]
*  escalate and kill innocent Ukrainians as President Zelensky has agreed to an unconditional [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=194.4s)]
*  ceasefire while Vladimir Putin has not. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=201.24s)]
*  And she's saying that him saying two weeks was a brilliant strategy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=204.36s)]
*  These are the most pathetic, vile human beings. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  I mean, can you believe what I'm showing you right here? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  So then another reporter asks Caroline Levitt and says, well, is he going to go to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=216.52s)]
*  Congress to ask for war powers authorization? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=223.72s)]
*  You know what she says? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=227.12s)]
*  Two weeks, two weeks here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=228.68s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=230.56s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=231.4s)]
*  Wars take some type of military action. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=231.88s)]
*  Would the president go to Congress to seek war authority? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=235.92s)]
*  I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=240.6s)]
*  I gave you the statement from the president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=242.32s)]
*  He'll make a decision within two weeks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=243.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=246.04s)]
*  Somebody else then asks a question. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=247.16s)]
*  So is the two week thing that you're saying, was that influence because of pressure by [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene and other MAGA people who said that they would [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=256.24s)]
*  no longer support Donald Trump if he committed American troops to war in Iran with Israel? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=262.08s)]
*  She goes, all I can say to you is you guessed it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Two weeks to play this clip like that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=272.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=275.6s)]
*  To what extent is this two week delay with Iran the result of interventions by the likes [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=276.52s)]
*  of Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene or the entreaties of European leaders who [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  want to de-escalation? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=284.52s)]
*  Look, the president hears all voices across the country and he makes decisions based on [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=285.84s)]
*  his instincts. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=290.56s)]
*  And he has always said diplomacy is his first option. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=291.92s)]
*  And is he still planning to attend the NATO summit next week? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  He is. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=297.28s)]
*  Yes, we will be departing from Washington on Monday morning and hopefully we'll see some [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  of you there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=302.28s)]
*  Akela. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Two weeks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=303.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=305.36s)]
*  Then you have this person in the press pool says, Rhino war monger Lindsey Graham says [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=306.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump needs to go all in on an invasion of Iran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  And what do you have to say about that? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=319.64s)]
*  You know what her response is? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=321.88s)]
*  Yes, two weeks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=323.8s)]
*  But you know what it also is? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=324.64s)]
*  Trust Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  I tell them, put your trust in Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=328.44s)]
*  Whatever dear leader says is right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=331.56s)]
*  Just trust whatever the hell he does. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  You don't believe me? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=338.96s)]
*  Here's what she says. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  We bring receipts. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=341.68s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=342.68s)]
*  So Rhino War Monger Lindsey Graham, you recently called on the US to go all in. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=344.24s)]
*  That's quite the lead to a question. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=349.64s)]
*  What's your message to everyday Trump supporters? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=353.32s)]
*  Not the Tucker Carlson's or other big names, but everyday Trump supporters, grassroots [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=356.0s)]
*  who voted for President Trump to stop the wars, rejected this in the primary going into [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=361.4s)]
*  another war with voting against Nikki Haley. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=366.92s)]
*  And they want to see non-US involvement in this war. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=370.6s)]
*  What's your message? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=373.84s)]
*  Trust in President Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=374.76s)]
*  President Trump has incredible instincts and President Trump kept America and the world [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=376.8s)]
*  safe in his first term as president in implementing a peace through strength foreign [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=381.96s)]
*  policy agenda. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  So then another reporter over here says, so a few weeks ago, Tucker Carlson reported that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=388.96s)]
*  Fox hosts like Mark Laman were in the Oval Office with Donald Trump pushing for the war [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  with Iran and that Donald Trump was considering sending American troops because of that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=405.76s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=411.8s)]
*  Is there a leak investigation? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=412.88000000000005s)]
*  Here's what she says. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=416.44s)]
*  A few weeks ago, Tucker Carlson reported on a meeting between the president and Mark Laman [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=417.68s)]

*  permission to do so. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=433.0s)]

*  To be very clear, Donald Trump had been trying to do a deal with Iran that was a weaker [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=553.72s)]

*  a presidential candidate, but also as a private citizen. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I have some quotes for you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  In 2011, President Trump said America's primary goal with Iran must be to destroy its nuclear [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=600.4s)]
*  ambitions. We cannot allow this radical regime to acquire [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=606.04s)]
*  a nuclear weapon that they will either use or hand off to terrorists. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=609.32s)]
*  In 2015, the president said the problem is that Iran poses next essential threat to Israel, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  our Middle Eastern allies in the United States. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=618.72s)]
*  And of course, the president has repeated that in his first term as president and his [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=620.7600000000001s)]
*  second term as president as well. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=624.12s)]
*  That's why he was adamantly opposed to the disastrous Iranian nuclear agreement that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=625.84s)]
*  was implemented by President Obama. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=630.6s)]
*  And it's why he has given great latitude and given a lot of effort to achieving a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=633.12s)]
*  diplomatic solution. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  But he's been very clear. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=639.64s)]
*  Iran went for 60 days when he gave them that 60 day warning without coming to the table [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=641.3599999999999s)]
*  on day 61. Israel took action against Iran. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=647.52s)]
*  And as I just told you from the president directly, he has he will make a decision [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  within two weeks. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=656.0s)]
*  So then, of course, she needs to pivot to her next topic. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=657.92s)]
*  And she says that illegal criminals are hiding in sanctuary cities. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=661.68s)]
*  So we will be ratcheting up ice invasions of blue cities. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=667.8399999999999s)]

*  Illegal criminals who are hiding in America's largest so-called sanctuary cities will be [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=684.4s)]

*  When it comes to the president's position on foreign policy in general, is there a phrase [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  that the White House has coined? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=716.04s)]
*  Is there a Trump doctrine? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=717.4s)]
*  Does the president like to talk about this? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=719.16s)]
*  Anyone here in the White House talking about this? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=720.8s)]
*  And if so, if there is something akin to a Trump doctrine, how would you define it? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=722.64s)]
*  America first, always. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=726.64s)]

*  right now? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  She is a rising star. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=762.88s)]

*  I hope that she continues to be a rising star for the Republican Party, at least. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=766.5999999999999s)]
*  I think it's incredibly derogatory to accuse nearly 80 million Americans of mental illness. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=771.68s)]
*  The last time I checked, Jasmine Crockett couldn't dream of winning such a majority of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=778.48s)]
*  the public as President Trump did. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=782.48s)]
*  And the America First movement, which President Trump has built, is filled of hardworking [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=784.32s)]
*  patriots, the forgotten men and women, business owners, law enforcement officers, nurses and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=788.9200000000001s)]

*  And then without a shred of irony that Donald Trump always says two weeks for everything, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=807.68s)]
*  two weeks for the health care plan. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfS0pGpeYI&t=816.0s)]
