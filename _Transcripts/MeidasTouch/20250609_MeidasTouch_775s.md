# Trump has MELTDOWN at WH LAWN and LOSES IT on CA GOV
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU)
*  Moments ago Donald Trump was having a meltdown on the White House lawn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=0.0s)]
*  He was calling for California Governor Gavin Newsom to be arrested. He was asked a question about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=4.5s)]
*  Said Gavin Newsom. This is what the question from Fox Gavin Newsom is daring Tom Homan to come and arrest him [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=12.1s)]
*  Should he do it? That's actually not what Gavin Newsom was doing at all [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=19.68s)]
*  It was actually Trump's borders are making threats against a California Governor Gavin Newsom and others [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  I'll play that clip in just a moment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=29.18s)]
*  But before Donald Trump said that he then posted this about Los Angeles and California [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=30.8s)]
*  He wrote we made a great decision in sending in the National Guard to deal with the violent [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Instigated riots in California if we had not done so Los Angeles would have been completely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=42.94s)]
*  Obliterated the very incompetent governor Gavin Newsom and mayor and he puts that in quotes Karen Bash should be saying thank you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=49.46s)]
*  President Trump you are so wonderful. We would be nothing without you, sir [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=57.0s)]
*  Instead they choose to lie to the people of California in America [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=61.02s)]
*  But I don't want to read the rest because it's so utterly despicable [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=64.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's been targeting hard-working communities with ICE raids here [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=67.48s)]
*  He's been going into courtrooms with ICE raids into factories into Home Depot's into schools [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=71.34s)]
*  Terrorizing communities here and escalating things the LAPD just two days ago said the protests were peaceful [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=78.78s)]
*  Then Donald Trump federalized the National Guard [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=85.62s)]
*  Unlawfully and sent them against the people here in California and in Los Angeles [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=89.18s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said on the White House lawn moments ago saying that yes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=93.7s)]
*  He thinks that Gavin Newsom should be arrested here play this clip [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=98.66s)]
*  He's daring Tom Homan to come in a rectum should he do it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=107.22s)]
*  Gavin likes the publicity but I think it would be a great thing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=116.02s)]
*  He stood here what he said he said I think it would be great because Gavin likes the publicity so utterly despicable [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=120.34s)]
*  And then last night Donald Trump posted arrest the people in masks now looking really bad in LA bring in the troops [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=127.5s)]
*  I want to bring in California senator Alex Padilla [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=135.02s)]
*  I want to get your take on all of that first just your immediate response to what I showed you then let's talk more broadly about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=138.58s)]
*  What's going on? Yeah, sadly, it's not shocking. You know, we have in Donald Trump is a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=144.34s)]
*  President who is had the biggest ego of any president I ever [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=150.94s)]
*  Can think of combined with the cruelty and big dick vindictiveness [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=155.18s)]
*  That is Donald Trump and it's playing out in Los Angeles right now my home. So this is actually very personal for me [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=160.66s)]
*  He this is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making when you have the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=169.3s)]
*  using increasingly cruel and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=176.86s)]
*  aggressive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=180.02s)]
*  tactics for immigration [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=181.5s)]
*  Enforcement, of course in a community as diverse as Los Angeles [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=183.26s)]
*  you're gonna have people speaking up in defense of our fundamental rights and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=186.86s)]
*  Due process to due process rights that the Trump administration consistently has been [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=191.58s)]
*  Ignoring and so at every turn Donald Trump will seek an excuse make up an excuse if necessary to further [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=196.34s)]
*  Escalate the situation. So that's what's transpired in Los Angeles. I want to thank all the folks that have been out there peacefully [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  protesting the vast majority of folks are peacefully and righteously [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  Protesting and as the folks that are involved with the vandalism what not that's that's not helpful [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=215.88s)]
*  Has no place in this protester or anywhere else [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=220.94s)]
*  but it's hurting us by taking the attention away from standing up for immigrants rights and due process and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=223.62s)]
*  Having the president and some of the press focuses strictly on some of the violence and vandalism that's going on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=230.06s)]
*  You know, my wife is first-generation American her family's from Guadalajara [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=237.86s)]
*  They became citizens a few decades ago [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  Her mom did they live in Huntington Park and her nieces and nephews are at their graduation as we're recording this interview and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  There's ice trucks right around there [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=254.22s)]
*  Where the graduation is taking place at Huntington High School at the middle school right there, you know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=257.9s)]
*  And I can you know, just I hear from them how terrified they are about, you know, what's going on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=263.86s)]
*  You're seeing people arrested in the in the streets [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=270.38s)]
*  And it seems that ice is specifically targeting not the criminals like they said they were focused on but they're going into the hard-working [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=273.18s)]
*  Latino communities here people who were living their American dreams [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=282.5s)]
*  Almost seeming knowing that that would prove that's how you provoke the people because when you rip people apart from their families [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=286.82s)]
*  People get pissed. So what do you say to what do you say to people who are scared right now? Yeah [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=294.14s)]
*  Hang in there know your rights, right because regardless of your immigration status [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=299.38000000000005s)]
*  You do you do have due process rights if you are approached by an ICE officer or federal agent [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=304.5s)]
*  You are not forced to respond to their questions. You have the right to access all those basic things [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=310.94000000000005s)]
*  But sadly, we know that Donald Trump has been working for this moment for years and years and years [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  Right the the cruelty of his speech started when he came down that escalator at Trump Tower to launch his campaign for president the very first time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=324.58s)]
*  So as you point out, we're a far cry from him only targeting violent dangerous criminals [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=333.86s)]
*  That's what he talked about at a campaign trail and I don't think frankly there's any disagreements [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=339.3s)]
*  With that if that was the priority and the mission [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  But when we hear story after story of an otherwise, you know [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=347.58s)]
*  law-abiding innocent working man working woman providing for their family being caught up with detention and deportation [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=352.02s)]
*  Operations without access to counsel without due process that is absolutely wrong when you hear stories of a four-year-old girl in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=359.29999999999995s)]
*  Central Valley whose depends on life-saving [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  Treatment to keep her alive being noticed that she's going to be deported [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=371.34s)]
*  Thankfully, they rescinded that but only because of the public pressure that was mounted against the administration in that particular case [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=376.34s)]
*  You know for a federal agent to show up in houses of worship in schools [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=383.74s)]
*  You're talking about, you know the highest graduation in HP. Yes, we call Huntington Park HP [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Or even in elementary schools recently in Los Angeles [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  Misrepresenting that they had parental [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=398.14s)]
*  To talk to kids what is Donald Trump doing and so of course it's enraging [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  We have to continue to speak up not just [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=406.74s)]
*  Organizing in the communities in Los Angeles and around the state and around the country [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=410.94s)]
*  But know that we're gonna fight and keep pushing here in Congress demanding information and calling them on every [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=414.74s)]
*  Overreach every out of policy or every unconstitutional tactic that they continue to try to deploy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=421.14s)]
*  No, and here's a prime example of what Trump's ice is doing. I think this needs to get more attention [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=426.78s)]
*  So David Huerta us citizen president of the SCIU [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=433.02s)]
*  Very important union here in California across the country. He was the president of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=438.14s)]
*  California's SCIU [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=444.18s)]
*  He was there peacefully [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  Explaining to people what their rights were and I want to just show our audience and what is what happened to him here play this clip [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  And [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=456.26s)]
*  So based on what everybody saw there the DOJ then doubled down they charged him with [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=471.5s)]
*  conspiracy to impede an officer [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=479.14s)]
*  There's a criminal complaint his arraignment [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  Is today and so we're seeing the weaponization of the Department of Justice as well and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  In trying to make example of a union leader like like David Huerta. What's your response to that situation? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=491.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, my heart goes out to David and his family. I've known David for many many years [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=498.86s)]
*  He's not just a local leader. He's a local hero for his advocacy for working people [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=503.66s)]
*  As president of his SCIU local and his leadership at the state level, but look I can't help but take this personally [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=510.38s)]
*  Born and raised in Los Angeles proud son of immigrants from Mexico [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=518.78s)]
*  So let's for a moment go back to California in the year 1994 when Governor Pete Wilson was struggling in his reelection campaign [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=522.5s)]
*  So what does he do? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=530.78s)]
*  He starts trying to blame all of California's woes at the time on immigrants and the immigrant community [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=531.84s)]
*  He championed a ballot measure known as proposition 187 sort of a precursor to all this anti [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  Immigrant rhetoric that we're hearing coming out of the White House today [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=545.12s)]
*  It was to me personally offensive and insulting so much that I left an engineering career behind to get involved in politics to commit [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=548.56s)]
*  To public service and thankfully California is much different politically today than it was back then but the attacks keep coming [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=556.4s)]
*  and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=564.72s)]
*  The if anything we should look at that California narrative of people like my parents who had been here for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=566.2s)]
*  Years and years and years without any urgency of becoming a citizen [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=572.28s)]
*  Finally doing so and so many others like them doing the same you had my generation [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=576.04s)]
*  We were a little bit younger at the time but committing ourselves to organizing and advocating [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=581.16s)]
*  That's why California is the California of today. That should be a [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=585.88s)]
*  Model for other communities across the country to follow [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=590.36s)]
*  Let's get through these difficult challenging times but build on them and build that better future consider this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  California it's not just the most populous state in the nation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=602.2s)]
*  We are the most diverse state in the nation home to more immigrants than any state in the nation mostly documented [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=604.9s)]
*  Yes, some undocumented but California is also the largest economy of any other state in the nation by far [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  The fourth largest economy in the world not despite its immigrant population [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=618.36s)]
*  but thanks to the contribution of the immigrant community as workforce as [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=623.92s)]
*  consumers as [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=629.16s)]
*  Entrepreneurs, so not only is the administration attacking the immigrant community in the way that they're doing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=630.76s)]
*  Cruel and inhumane in some ways unlawful and unconstitutional [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=636.84s)]
*  But they're doing it against our own interest focus on the violent criminals [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=641.28s)]
*  But leave the hard-working people that our economy and our nation depends on they deserve better and to be a whole different thing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=645.2s)]
*  Entirely if Trump said we focus a little bit on enforcement and then here's the plan to modernize our immigration system [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDhybOaijcU&t=652.48s)]
