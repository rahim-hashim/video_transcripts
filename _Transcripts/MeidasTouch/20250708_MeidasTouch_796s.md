# Trump gets TERRIBLE NEWS in AM and FREAKS OUT in PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM)
*  Donald Trump is off to a terrible morning on Tuesday, and we've also learned that one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's top advisors was actually born in the Soviet Union and has been keeping that a secret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=4.64s)]
*  More on that in just a moment. Donald Trump ranting and raving like a lunatic on his social [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=11.6s)]
*  media platform. He's talking about those letters that he sent to countries that he couldn't do [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=17.2s)]
*  deals with in his failed trade war. Here's what he writes, as per letter sent to various countries [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=22.48s)]
*  yesterday in addition to letters that will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=28.96s)]
*  short period of time. Then he puts this all in caps. Tariffs will start being paid on August 1, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=33.68s)]
*  2025. There has been no change to this date and there will be no change. In other words, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=39.84s)]
*  all money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025. No extensions will be granted. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=45.68s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. Again, a tariff is a tax on the American company. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  The foreign countries are not paying the tariff. The importer is paying the tariff. This is a tax [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=58.4s)]
*  on American companies. Then Donald Trump held a disastrous cabinet briefing. In about 90 minutes, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=64.96s)]
*  I'll do a longer video because this thing was off the rails. But Donald Trump said that everybody [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=71.36s)]
*  did a great job in Texas. He said, congratulations on a job well done. Then he takes credit for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=76.48s)]
*  saving so many lives. And he says, this is the way it's supposed to happen. This was great. We [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=83.92s)]
*  crushed it. We did amazing. This is what he says at the cabinet meeting this morning. Play this clip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=89.36s)]
*  Response has been incredible. And the fact that we got along so well, I don't know. I don't even [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=94.4s)]
*  think that's a political thing, but we got along so well and it was so unified. I think a lot of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=100.56s)]
*  lives have been saying that could have been as bad as it was and you could have lost double or [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=107.12s)]
*  triple. This thing was just really horrible. Well, congratulations on a great job and I appreciate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=111.6s)]
*  to know you're going down. I'll be going down on Friday with you. Now I'd like to show you what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=118.64s)]
*  former National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration head Richard Spinrad had to say. And we've shown [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  you videos of him before about two months ago where he was warning about what would happen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=130.72s)]
*  with the cuts to NOAA, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, and the NWS, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  the National Weather Service, which is under NOAA. This is from this morning where Richard [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  Spinrad says that he is convinced, he uses that language, that the staff cuts were a contributing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  factor to the inability of the emergency managers to respond. Here, play this clip. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  I am convinced that the staff cuts that we saw were a contributing factor to the inability of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=160.96s)]
*  the emergency managers to respond. The staffing was just fine and the White House has concurred [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=167.44s)]
*  with this to get the forecast out, to get the watches and warnings issued. But when you send [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=172.8s)]
*  a message, there's no guarantee it's being received. So someone needs to follow up and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=178.24s)]
*  that's the warning board nation meteorologist, a position that was vacant. Now, as he mentions in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=182.72s)]
*  that clip, the vacancies were there in Texas. There were key vacancies within the National [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=188.48s)]
*  Weather Service and specifically the position of the meteorologist coordinator and the emergency [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=196.0s)]
*  coordinator was missing at the National Weather Service. So there's more than just pushing a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=203.04s)]
*  button and then an alert goes out because you get alerts all the time, right? That doesn't necessarily [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=209.28s)]
*  mean that when you see an alert, you immediately respond to it. It would be great if everybody did, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=216.32s)]
*  but the whole reason why you have the federal government create these positions is precisely [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=221.84s)]
*  for this reason, that people could be sleeping or not paying attention or they could be inundated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=227.92s)]
*  with so many alerts that one alert on their cell phone doesn't trigger the emergency as it should. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  So the feds were supposed to be in there immediately and the feds were supposed to be leading or at [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=239.28s)]
*  least running a joint task force or co-leading with the state. Now, I'll show you again more of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=245.2s)]
*  this in another video I'm going to do, but this is Christine Ohm, the Department of Homeland Security [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Secretary, which controls FEMA. And here, Christine Ohm says that the federal government does not [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=257.44s)]
*  manage disasters. The state does. This is not true. What she's saying is incorrect. Sure, the state [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  has a role at a local level in doing a lot of work and the state has local functions, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=272.48s)]
*  but the feds are supposed to go in there and take the lead and help run the show. Here, play this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=279.36s)]
*  clip. We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. The state does. So as you go [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  from Christine Ohm, then you take a look at some of Trump's other cabinet members, you have people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=291.68s)]
*  like Brooke Rollins, Donald Trump's Secretary of Agriculture this morning. And this is the new [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=296.88s)]
*  talking point from the Trump regime and Brooke Rollins. I think Aaron Melnick says it the best. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  So the Trump administration's new talking point on the budget bill is that we're going to deport [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=307.84s)]
*  all of the farm laborers and we're going to make people on Medicaid work in the fields [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=314.32s)]
*  to earn their health insurance. Now, you may be saying, Ben, what in the world are you talking [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=321.12s)]
*  about? Well, the Secretary of Agriculture from the Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=326.56s)]
*  she gave a press conference this morning where she said they're going to go after [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=332.16s)]
*  the migrants, not criminals, the migrants who did not commit crimes who are working on the fields. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=337.2s)]
*  But she goes, we'll be able to replace them because there are 34 million able-bodied adults [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=344.0s)]
*  in our Medicaid system. Here, play this clip. Single day. The second thing to your question [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=350.72s)]
*  about mass deportations. The President and I have spoken about that once or twice and he has always [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=355.52s)]
*  been of the mindset that at the end of the day, the promise to America to ensure that we have a 100% [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  American workforce stands, but we must be strategic in how we are implementing the mass deportation. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=367.52s)]
*  So is not to compromise our food supply. Ultimately, the answer on this is automation, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=373.84s)]
*  also some reform within the current governing structure. And then also when you think about [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=379.52s)]
*  their 34 million able-bodied adults in our Medicaid program, there are plenty of workers [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=383.92s)]
*  in America, but we just have to make sure we're not compromising today, especially in the context [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=389.44s)]
*  of everything we're thinking about right now. So no amnesty under any circumstances. Mass deportations [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=394.8s)]
*  continue, but in a strategic and intentional way as we move our workforce toward more automation [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=400.64s)]
*  and toward a 100% American workforce. As Jordan Weissman says, LOL. So we've gone from [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=406.16s)]
*  the USAID program analysts will make shoes to people will pick strawberries in order to keep [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=412.4s)]
*  their health care. You then had MAGA Republican Congress member Jim Jordan. And Jim Jordan goes [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  on Fox and he says, you know how we know this budget bill is great? The left hates it. And if [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=428.64s)]
*  they hate it, it must be amazing owning the libs by taking the health care away from your [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=435.04s)]
*  own constituent. Great job, Jim Jordan. Play this clip. If there's an able-bodied adult out there [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=442.0s)]
*  now who is in our welfare system, guess what? That person's going to have to work. That is fair [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=447.92s)]
*  to taxpayers. That's good for our economy. Maybe most importantly, that's actually good for that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=453.04s)]
*  recipient, for that individual gets them on a better path to to attaining work and skills and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  everything else to get to a better position in life. That is far from immoral. But we, I always [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=461.84s)]
*  say, David, we know this is a good bill because the left hates it and the left hates it because [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=466.56s)]
*  it does not empower government. I love going out with friends, but I don't always feel like drinking. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=471.84s)]
*  That's why I've been reaching for Sol's out of office gummies instead. They are the perfect [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  little lift to keep the good vibes going and give me that light social buzz without the hangover. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=480.4s)]
*  Sol is a wellness brand that believes feeling good should be fun and easy. Sol specializes [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  in delicious hemp derived THC and CBD products designed to boost your mood and help you unwind. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=490.96s)]
*  Their best-selling out of office gummies were designed to provide a mild relaxing buzz, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=496.4s)]
*  boost your mood and enhance creativity and relaxation. And what I love is the flexibility. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=500.4s)]
*  They come in four strengths. So whether I want a micro dose or a more noticeable effect, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=505.44s)]
*  there's something for every vibe. Plus they're vegan, gluten-free, low in sugar and made from [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  USA grown organically farmed hemp. So I feel good about what I'm taking. Oh, and their out of office [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=514.24s)]
*  beverage is my new favorite. It's a crisp alcohol-free drink. That's perfect for those [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=520.08s)]
*  warm summer nights. Bring on the good vibes and treat yourself to Sol today. Right now, Sol is [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=524.96s)]
*  offering our audience 30% off your entire order. So go to getsol.com and use code MIDAS. That's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=530.32s)]
*  getsol.com promo code MIDAS, M-E-I-D-A-S for 30% off. And here you have a Fox host with a MAGA [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  Republican Congress member, Greg Stube. And the Fox host and Stube cannot be more cruel. They're [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=546.16s)]
*  like, most people, lots of people work 80 hours a week. And then Stube's like, I would cut even [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=552.8s)]
*  more from the government, but we have some more moderate members who don't let us cut. I would [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=558.16s)]
*  have cut everything from the government. Here, play this clip. But within Medicaid, and I think [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=562.48s)]
*  this is where the messaging has been interesting, it's 80 hours a month that you have to show that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=567.12s)]
*  you worked. 80 hours a month. A lot of people, congressmen, work 80 hours a week. Things like [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=573.5200000000001s)]
*  that that were in those Medicaid decisions, those cuts. At the same time, you've got reconciliation [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  coming. You've got rescissions coming. So aren't there more places that we can cut? And where would [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=585.6s)]
*  you be willing to make cuts in spending so that we don't completely blow out the debt in this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=590.72s)]
*  country, which is already sitting at 37 trillion? Yeah, I support massive cuts to a whole entirety [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=597.12s)]
*  of government programs that we have. But unfortunately, we have, well, not unfortunately, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  but we have moderates in our party that obviously can't support the type of cuts that somebody like [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=609.12s)]
*  me would support. Like folks, we need a functioning government. What is wrong with these people? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=613.92s)]
*  Well, that's why I call this a death cult. Then you had Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=620.32s)]
*  It was each cabinet member be clowning themselves worse than the next. No offense to clowns. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=628.08s)]
*  These are fascist clowns. Sean Duffy then says, you know what? He goes, all of these stupid, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=633.6s)]
*  liberal, stupid policies in New York are so stupid. That's how they talk now. That's how [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=641.04s)]
*  they communicate. Here, play this clip. They're taking roads for buses and for cars, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=645.68s)]
*  and they're making them bike lanes. So you take away lanes, you get more congestion. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xJzBMtEyIM&t=652.16s)]
