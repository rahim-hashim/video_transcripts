# MISSING Footage UNCOVERED in Trump COVER UP of FILES
**MeidasTouch:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4)
*  The security footage is missing one minute. Yep, the Trump regime released what it purported to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=0.0s)]
*  video footage right by the prison cell of Jeffrey Epstein and the surveillance footage as you go [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  through it. You'll see right here it's missing a minute from 11 58 59 p.m. to 11 59 59 p.m. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=14.08s)]
*  One minute is missing from the Epstein security camera footage. Where did it go? What happened [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=23.04s)]
*  there? Now this comes as the Trump regime's DOJ is now claiming that there is no such thing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=28.96s)]
*  as an Epstein list. They're saying the Epstein list never existed, that Epstein did not keep a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=36.32s)]
*  list to try to blackmail rich men. Seriously, that's what you're going with. And Donald Trump is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=43.52s)]
*  posting on his social media platform moments ago, congratulations to Cash Patel and Dan Bongino, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=51.04s)]
*  his FBI director and deputy FBI director, and saying they are doing a great job. Those two [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=59.84s)]
*  individuals before being appointed to the top positions at the FBI were some of the biggest [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  purveyors of information relating to Epstein. Then Trump appointed them to lead the FBI and now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=72.88s)]
*  they're claiming Epstein, they say, definitely died by suicide and nobody killed them after they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=80.16s)]
*  seem to suggest when they were podcasters that there was a deeper conspiracy at play and after [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  they had been talking about the Epstein list. So just let me show you again. Let's just show people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  the security footage. Look again, you can see right here how it skips 11 58 59 p.m. to 11 59 59 p.m. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=99.36s)]
*  You see it for yourself right there. OK, now here's what Donald Trump has posted. The FBI [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  under the direction of director Cash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino is back to the basics, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  locking up criminals and cleaning up America's streets. We have the greatest law enforcement [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=121.52s)]
*  professionals in the world, but politics and corrupt leadership often prevented them from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=126.32s)]
*  doing their job. This is no longer the case. And now they have been unleashed to do their jobs and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=132.0s)]
*  they are doing just that. Keep it up. Make America safe again. How about you just release the Epstein [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=137.76s)]
*  files like you claimed you were going to? Oh, wait a minute. Isn't it because you were very [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=145.04s)]
*  close to Epstein? You said Epstein in the early 2000s, great guy, likes women on the younger side, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=150.88s)]
*  you said Epstein trafficked women from Mar-a-Lago, underage girls as well from Mar-a-Lago like [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=157.6s)]
*  Virginia Joufray, who was underage, was homeless, working at Mar-a-Lago. Guilain Maxwell, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=163.68s)]
*  one of the sex traffickers for Epstein, found Virginia Joufray at Mar-a-Lago, brought her back [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=170.4s)]
*  so that Epstein could traffic her. You partied with Epstein. We have all of the videos of that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=175.68s)]
*  You're on Epstein's flight log over and over again. You're on his call log over and over again. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  You're in the Epstein files that have been released already in the civil cases. You're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  number, you have your DOE 178 or DOE 172. You're literally one of the DOEs that were named in the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=190.4s)]
*  Epstein cases. At Guilain Maxwell's criminal trial, a woman who at the time was a girl, 14-year-old [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  underage girl at the time, said that she was introduced to Donald Trump by Epstein and Guilain [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=207.2s)]
*  Maxwell. Why don't we see what her testimony is? In depositions of women and girls trafficked by [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=212.48s)]
*  Epstein, Donald Trump's name appears. Epstein's on his plane. He says he's going to go to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=217.76s)]
*  Atlantic City to see Donald. There were all of those connections there. That's clearly why Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  didn't want this to be released. Now, again, the cover-up continues. Earlier today, you had a press [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=230.16s)]
*  conference. Trump's propagandist, Caroline Levitt, says that this is the ultimate transparency, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=237.6s)]
*  that there's an exhaustive investigation and that there's nothing to see with Epstein at all, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=244.72s)]
*  and nothing was found. No lists. Here plays clip of Levitt. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=250.72s)]
*  But they committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did. And they provided the results [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  of that. That's transparency. Now, even Peter Ducey was the Fox host. He was asking Caroline [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=259.44s)]
*  Levitt, what happened to the client list? Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said it was on her [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=268.88s)]
*  desk. And then Caroline Levitt tries to say, I think if you go back what she really said, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=275.44s)]
*  and Ducey goes, I have the quote. She says, the list is on my desk. Here, watch this. Let's play. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  That's transparency. Oh, okay. So the FBI looks at the circumstances [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. According to the report, this systematic review [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=291.2s)]
*  revealed no incriminating client list. So what happened to the Epstein client list that the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=298.0s)]
*  attorney general said she had on her desk? Well, I think if you go back and look at [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=304.24s)]
*  what the attorney general said in that interview, which was on your network on Fox News, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=309.04s)]
*  John Roberts said, DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. Will that really [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=313.76s)]
*  happen? And she said, it's sitting on my desk right now to review. Yes. She was saying the entirety of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=318.56s)]
*  all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. That's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=325.04s)]
*  what the attorney general was referring to. And I'll let her speak for that. But again, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  when it comes to the FBI and the Department of Justice, they are more than committed to ensuring [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  that bad people are put behind bars. They have an operation going on right now called Summer Heat, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  which has our murder rate trending in the lowest direction in United States history. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=344.16s)]
*  Their emphasis on violent crime and locking up violent criminals has led to the arrest of 14,000 [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=349.12s)]
*  violent criminals. That's a 62% increase from the same time period last year. So this attorney [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=354.88s)]
*  general and the FBI director are committed to putting bad people behind bars where they belong, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=360.08s)]
*  that they promised an exhaustive review. That's what they did. For any further details, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=365.36s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. Here's the official memo we've got our hands on [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=369.76s)]
*  from the Department of Justice. Take a look right here. So this is what they're releasing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  instead of the files and instead of the list. Here's what the DOJ and FBI saying. The systemic [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=378.96s)]
*  review revealed no incriminating client list. There was also no credible evidence found that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=384.64s)]
*  Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not uncover evidence that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=390.88s)]
*  could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties. Now remember, when Epstein died, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump was in office in the first term. Remember back August 2019, what the headlines were? FBI [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  studies two broken cameras outside the cell where Epstein died. Broken cameras now, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=412.0s)]
*  they're releasing footage that has a minute missing. And then remember earlier several months back, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=418.48s)]
*  the White House invited all those right-wing influencers to the White House and they were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=424.24s)]
*  given a binder. Look right here what the binder says. The Epstein files, phase one, there were [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=428.96s)]
*  going to be multiple other phases. Now, one of the things that we called out right away when we saw [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=434.32s)]
*  what they gave these influencers, they gave these influencers a phone log, a list of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=439.52s)]
*  individuals whose phone numbers that Epstein had and it was mostly all redacted. But this had been [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=446.08s)]
*  released many years ago and Trump's name was on there because they were close friends and Epstein [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=451.84s)]
*  had all of Trump's contact information on there. And all of these right-wing influencers you see [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=458.0s)]
*  right here promised us, don't worry, we're going to release the list. This is just phase one. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=462.56s)]
*  There's a bigger plan here when it was clear that they were just given the old documents that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=467.76s)]
*  already came out in the civil cases, which had Trump's name all, which we knew had Trump's name [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=472.32s)]
*  all over it. Remember when Fox reported back on February 21st, 2025, the DOJ may be releasing the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  list of Epstein clients. Will that really happen? Bondi, it's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=484.8s)]
*  That's been the directive by President Trump. You can hear her say it for yourself right here. Let's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=490.32s)]
*  play it. The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. Will that really happen? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=494.56s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=500.88s)]
*  reviewing that. I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. That's all in the process of being reviewed [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=506.56s)]
*  because that was done at the directive of the president from all of these agencies. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=512.4s)]
*  So have you seen anything there? You said, oh my gosh. Not yet. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=515.76s)]
*  Okay. Well, we'll check back with you. And then she started claiming that the prosecutors [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=520.4s)]
*  from SDNY, New York, were hiding stuff and FBI officials in New York were hiding stuff. Play this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=527.76s)]
*  clip. I want to get into this Epstein thing a little bit. I think the American people are [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=534.16s)]
*  very curious about who's on this list or these lists. You have been doggedly trying to get all [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=538.24s)]
*  the information. And now we learn thanks to you that you've been stonewalled by people in New York. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=544.32s)]
*  Do you want to explain that? Yes, Mark. So as you know, we released about 120 pages of documents. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=553.12s)]
*  And I started asking for these documents right when I came into office and before Cash Patel was [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=561.84s)]
*  in there. So I ended up getting about 120 pages. We carefully redacted them, of course, to be sure [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=568.56s)]
*  the 254 young girls, women who are victims of sex crimes and sex trafficking, their personal [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=576.64s)]
*  information was redacted and out of there to protect them. So I'm going through it and I kept [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=584.2399999999999s)]
*  saying there has to be more. There has to be more. I'm assured that's it. Cash, ask the same questions. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=588.8s)]
*  Assured there's no more. Last I found out, you know, this week that a source told me New York, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=594.48s)]
*  SDNY, they're sitting on thousands of pages of documents regarding Epstein, thousands, thousands. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=601.84s)]
*  And of course, you've seen the very strong letter. We will get everything. We will have it in our [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=609.52s)]
*  possession. We will redact it, of course, to protect grand jury information and confidential [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=615.28s)]
*  witnesses. But the American people have a right to know. And Donald Trump is the most transparent [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=622.0s)]
*  president in our nation's history. So not only will America get the full Epstein files, they will [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=627.2s)]
*  get JFK, they will get Martin Luther King. But what seemed to be very clear is that Donald Trump [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=632.96s)]
*  was terrified of releasing these files because he's going to be on them. I know he's going to be on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=638.4s)]
*  them because he's a doe in the cases. That means he's one of the men who names were redacted by the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=643.92s)]
*  court. And you can tell which doe he was. You don't know what it's specific being alleged that he did [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  or didn't do in relation to that doe. But we do know that again, Epstein trafficked woman from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=659.76s)]
*  We know what Trump's statements were about that. Now, here was Donald Trump on Fox saying when he [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=667.76s)]
*  was asked, are you going to release the Epstein files? And he was like, well, you know, there may [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=674.48s)]
*  be a lot of phony stuff on there. You're playing this clip. Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=677.76s)]
*  Yeah. Would you declassify JFK files? Yeah, I did. I did a lot of it. Would you declassify the Epstein [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  files? Yeah, yeah, I would. All right. I guess I would. I think that less so because, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=689.36s)]
*  you don't know. You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because there's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=695.52s)]
*  a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would. Okay. And then in preparation for [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=699.52s)]
*  the release of the Epstein files in the list, he had all of his right-wing media and news anchors [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=706.88s)]
*  and propagandists, not real news anchors, propagandists trying to spin it when his name was [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=713.12s)]
*  going to be on it. So you have Sean Hannity here basically saying no one should rush to judgment. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=719.52s)]
*  There's a lot of rich men who were friends with Epstein. So don't rush to judgment. Here's what [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=724.88s)]
*  Hannity said. Play this clip. Today, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi released phase one of the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=729.6s)]
*  Epstein files. That's transparency. There are a lot of names in there. And Epstein was obviously a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=734.08s)]
*  star chaser who wanted to hang out with people that are famous, people with money. So let me be [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=740.64s)]
*  very clear at the start here. And I said this on my radio show today. People, because they're in the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=745.84s)]
*  Rolodex, they're on the list does not mean they did anything wrong on this show. And we have done [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=750.0s)]
*  it over and over again. We don't rush to judgment. We believe in the presumption of innocence. And I [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=756.56s)]
*  am appealing to people not to rush to judgment, even though these names are now public information. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=762.48s)]
*  There are names that I'm certain were not involved or knowledgeable. This I could be certain of it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=768.24s)]
*  Charlie Kirk said something different. If you lived in Palm Beach, you were friends with Epstein. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=772.88s)]
*  That's what they were going with here. Play this clip. Now, 10 years later, we're supposed to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=776.72s)]
*  believe there's going to be a smoking gun of something in the Epstein files. But what is in [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=780.96s)]
*  the Epstein files is yes, President Donald Trump has probably mentioned he was mentioned in the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=785.44s)]
*  Epstein file dump back in February. You know why he lived in Palm Beach? There's probably thousands [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=789.84s)]
*  of names in the Epstein files. Was he part of the Epstein client list? Absolutely not. That is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=795.52s)]
*  complete nonsense. But to say that Donald Trump is not releasing the Epstein files because he's in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=801.04s)]
*  them in some incriminating way. Yes, it's very clear that if you live in Palm Beach, you might [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=808.56s)]
*  have been mentioned and caught up in some sort of conversation with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=815.04s)]
*  If you lived in Palm Beach, you were friends with Epstein. That's what you were going with. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  But now it's miraculously gone. Now, in May, we had Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=823.12s)]
*  a former federal prosecutor, top federal prosecutor out of New York. He saw what was happening in real [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=830.4s)]
*  time in May. He called it out in May. He goes, I know what they're going to do. They're going to try [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=835.76s)]
*  to bury these files. Here's what he said in May. Let's play it. And so there was a mad dash and a [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  big rush to release everything and everyone was talking about it. And now there's radio silence. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  And the begs the question, why has the attorney general gone dark on this? Why has Congresswoman [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=851.12s)]
*  Luna and others stopped calling for it? What is it that's in the Epstein files that they were so [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=860.16s)]
*  eager to have that now are just not being released according to the attorney general's promises of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  transparency, but are still there? And there's no explanation. And the concern I have, of course, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=875.36s)]
*  is we know Donald Trump had a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. We know Jeffrey Epstein had [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=884.56s)]
*  numerous numbers for Donald Trump. And the question then is, was this some sort of directive from [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump or someone on his staff or an agent of his to the attorney general to kill this? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=898.2399999999999s)]
*  And that would be yet another pretty egregious act of corruption using his position as president. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  For his own personal benefit, it is incumbent upon the Republicans currently in the majority to do [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  their damn job, do their job and conduct oversight over the president of the United States. Stop [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=920.0s)]
*  sucking up to him so much. And finally, here's just so you see for yourself the video of Donald [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=927.28s)]
*  Trump partying over and over again with Epstein. I mean, real sick. Look at it. Look how sick Donald [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=932.08s)]
*  Trump looks in this video here. Like disgusting. The predator play this clip. I'm going to get [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  great ratings on your show. Trump is surrounded by women as music blares in the background. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=942.24s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=948.08s)]
*  More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. Later in the footage, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=956.32s)]
*  Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=962.32s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=967.52s)]
*  and telling Epstein about the cameras. Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=972.48s)]
*  as they discuss the women and their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=979.68s)]
*  look at her back there. She's hot. And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=987.04s)]
*  that makes him double over with laughter. But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=996.08s)]
*  I was not a f- And of course we know that Donald Trump is indeed a sexual predator. He has been [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=1003.2s)]
*  found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case and he's on camera bragging about sexually assaulting [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=1008.32s)]
*  women. He says when you're rich, you get away with it. And he says that that's locker room talk and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=1014.08s)]
*  that's how you, that's how people like him talk, he said. There you have it. Tell me what you think. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B51pRQxnh-4&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
