# Middle East Dialogues: Jared Kushner in conversation with Tarek Masoud
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3.64s)]
*  It's a great pleasure to welcome you this evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5.36s)]
*  My name is Tarek Massoud. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=9.48s)]
*  I am a professor of public policy here at the Kennedy School, and I'm the faculty chair [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=11.36s)]
*  of our Middle East Initiative. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=17.36s)]
*  And it's really my great pleasure to welcome you to this first in our spring series of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=20.0s)]
*  what we are calling Middle East dialogues, which are a series of conversations that I'm [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  having with individuals whom I believe hold varied and vital perspectives, not just on [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=31.2s)]
*  the conflict in the region, but on the paths towards a more peaceful and prosperous future [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=38.0s)]
*  for the people of that part of the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=43.76s)]
*  And our guest this evening is one of the few people on the planet who doesn't need an introduction, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  and that's Mr. Jared Kushner. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=53.64s)]
*  He was a senior advisor to President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021, where he handled [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=55.9s)]
*  a number of vital portfolios, from prison reform to trade agreements with Canada and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=62.3s)]
*  Mexico to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic to the reason that we're here tonight, which [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=69.82s)]
*  is peacemaking in the Middle East. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=76.8s)]
*  And when I put together this series, Jared Kushner's name was the very first name on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=79.14s)]
*  my list, and that's because he was the architect of the Abraham Accords, which I personally [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=85.46s)]
*  believe to be one of the most significant developments in the Middle East in recent [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=90.88s)]
*  memory. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=95.58s)]
*  And he's just generally a dealmaker par excellence. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=96.58s)]
*  And if there's any part of the world that I think needs really excellent dealmakers [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=100.86s)]
*  right now, I think it's the Middle East. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=104.13999999999999s)]
*  So I'm honored that he accepted my invitation to return to Harvard, his old stomping grounds, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=106.58s)]
*  to have an open and candid conversation about some of the toughest issues on the planet [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=112.54s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  And so here's what we're going to do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk for about 45 minutes, and then we'll take questions from my students [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  who I will call on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  And those of you who know me know that you should never put a middle-aged Egyptian male [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=128.34s)]
*  in charge of timekeeping, so I'm going to try to keep everything on time so that we [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  can end at the appointed hour. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  So first, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Jared Kushner. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=141.14s)]
*  Jared, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=147.1s)]
*  So I just want to dive right into the war on Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=154.7s)]
*  We all know of the gruesome terrorist attack that happened on October 7th. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  innocent Israelis brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, more than 200 people taken hostages. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=165.54s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed a fearsome military response, which was designed or intended [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  to make sure that this never happens again. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  And now today, four months later, more than 25,000 Palestinians are dead. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=185.26s)]
*  I can't tell you what percentage of them are Hamas terrorists, but we know that half of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  them are women and children. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=196.78s)]
*  We know that more than a million Gazans are trying to shelter in the south of the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=198.98s)]
*  They're amassing on the border with Egypt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  Many reports indicate that Gazans are now enduring a famine, and Israel is poised to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=206.66s)]
*  begin a ground operation in Rafah that we think will take many more civilian lives. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=212.22s)]
*  We know Israel's being accused of genocide in front of the International Court of Justice, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=219.22s)]
*  and even President Biden says that the Israeli operation has been over the top. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=223.06s)]
*  But I'm guessing you don't support calls for a ceasefire, and I want to ask why. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=228.62s)]
*  Or jump right into it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=234.38s)]
*  So it's good. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=237.24s)]
*  First of all, it's really great to be here, and thank you for putting on this dialogue [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=238.24s)]
*  on the Middle East. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=241.54s)]
*  I think it's a topic that I spent a lot of time, I spent four years working on when I [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=242.54s)]
*  was in the White House. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=246.5s)]
*  It wasn't an issue that I had a lot of experience with, so I really came into it with a blank [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=247.5s)]
*  slate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=251.7s)]
*  I wish I'd been in some classes like this and gone to lectures like this when I was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=252.7s)]
*  at Harvard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=254.94s)]
*  Maybe it would have actually given me a worse outcome. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=255.94s)]
*  But I hope today I'll share with you some of my experience and perspectives. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=258.86s)]
*  But I will say that throughout my time, a lot of the things that I would say, a lot [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=265.54s)]
*  were fairly heavily complained about or criticized from, I would say, the consensus thinking. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=273.08s)]
*  And so I think that, number one, when looking at the current situation, I tried to look [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=278.96s)]
*  at everything kind of first principles, and I try to say, you know, what's going on? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=286.68s)]
*  What should it be? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=291.08s)]
*  What are the right actions? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=292.36s)]
*  And what I find is that there's a lot of emotion with this issue. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Some of it justified, some of it unjustified for a whole host of it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=297.5s)]
*  And what I would say is this, I think that, number one, I take a step back and say, like, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=301.74s)]
*  why are we here? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  You go back to 2021, and when I was able to go back to my normal life after leaving office, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  our four years in service, we basically left the Middle East where it was very calm. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=315.42s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  It was calm. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  It had momentum. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  You think about ISIS, they were basically, the caliphate was gone. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=323.6s)]
*  Syria, the civil war, had mostly stabilized in the sense that you didn't have to think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=327.42s)]
*  500,000 people were killed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=331.86s)]
*  When we started, Yemen was destabilized. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=333.98s)]
*  Libya was destabilized. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=336.26s)]
*  ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio, and Iran was flush with cash. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  And they were basically using that money to fund Hamas, to fund Hezbollah, to fund the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=341.1s)]
*  Houthis, and they were on a glide path to a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=344.86s)]
*  So we inherited a really, really bad hand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=347.5s)]
*  And then with the JCPOA agreement, which was probably one of the dumbest agreements, I [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=351.8s)]
*  think, ever negotiated, just as anyone who studies agreements and deals, that really [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  left us in a bad situation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=361.18s)]
*  So we worked hard. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=362.5s)]
*  We tried to regain trust. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=363.5s)]
*  We did a lot of work, and we could talk about that later. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=364.5s)]
*  But the way we left the region was basically we had six peace deals in the last six months [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  that we were there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=372.38s)]
*  Less, I think in the last maybe four or five months that we were there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=373.38s)]
*  So we took a different approach to the Palestinians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=376.26000000000005s)]
*  We were able to make peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=380.54s)]
*  Bahrain, then Sudan, then Kosovo was able to recognize Morocco. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=383.5s)]
*  And then finally, we resolved the GCC dispute, which put everything on a pretty good glide [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=389.14s)]
*  path. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=392.58s)]
*  Iran was basically broke. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=393.58s)]
*  They were out of foreign currency reserves, which meant that no money was going to any [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=395.14s)]
*  of these terrorist organizations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=397.94s)]
*  And then in addition to that, the Palestinians basically were out of money, too. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=399.74s)]
*  We'd stopped funding UNRWA. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=402.62s)]
*  We saw that UNRWA was basically taking the money that we were giving them to the United [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=404.58s)]
*  Nations. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=408.74s)]
*  It was taxpayer dollars that we were giving to the United Nations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=409.74s)]
*  We thought it was going to fund terrorists to give them energy, to give them resources. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=412.06s)]
*  We saw a lot of their schools and their mosques were basically where they would hide the bombs [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=417.5s)]
*  and the missiles and their munitions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=422.18s)]
*  And we thought the education that they were giving was really a very, very poor education [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=424.58s)]
*  that was radicalizing the next generation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=427.66s)]
*  So we said, oh, OK, there we go. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=429.38s)]
*  So basically, we thought that the right thing to do basically was to stop funding that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=434.02s)]
*  And that was the way that we wanted to kind of advance. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=439.54s)]
*  So we went forward. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  We were able to create the peace deals. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  Then you kind of move forward in the region for three years. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  We thought that Saudi had the ability to do a normalization deal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=449.26000000000005s)]
*  And we had worked with the Biden administration in order to help them get that pathway to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=452.86s)]
*  follow the pathway that we were in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  So now you forward three years. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=463.54s)]
*  You have the attack, which was awful. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  Not enforcing the sanctions on Iran, they were able to get funding, which they were [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=468.14s)]
*  able to then give to all these different groups. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=471.7s)]
*  You saw a lot more rise up in the extremism. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=473.62s)]
*  And I think that America not standing with Israel in the way that they should be led [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=475.78s)]
*  to a lot of this occurring. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=480.62s)]
*  So you have a situation now where Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=481.78s)]
*  They're in a position where they had a brutal attack. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=486.26s)]
*  Imagine America, somebody coming over the border, brutally raping, killing civilians, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=489.06s)]
*  doing all these different things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  That's something that I think would be quite horrific for a lot of us. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  And then I think the sentiment was basically, how do we put this in a position where we [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=498.98s)]
*  attack back? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=504.06s)]
*  So I think that what Israel's done is they're saying, how do we secure ourselves? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=504.74s)]
*  This doesn't happen again. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, one death is too many deaths. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=509.70000000000005s)]
*  You don't want any deaths in Israel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=511.42s)]
*  You don't want deaths of Palestinians. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=512.5s)]
*  But I think right now the situation is a complex one. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=514.46s)]
*  But I do hope that with the right leadership, they'll be able to find a right way to get [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=517.4200000000001s)]
*  it to a better place. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=520.78s)]
*  So this is great, because you definitely preempted one question that I was going to ask you, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=522.14s)]
*  which was President Trump has been saying that this would never have happened on his [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=529.1s)]
*  watch. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=534.22s)]
*  But before we get to that, I just want to ask, I just want to think about this problem [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=534.7s)]
*  for a minute. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=539.78s)]
*  One thing I associate Jared Kushner with is creative dealmaking, thinking outside the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=540.62s)]
*  box. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=546.34s)]
*  Do you have a proposal or an idea or a sketch for how we end this crisis? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=547.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=553.54s)]
*  So I think that the dilemma that Israeli leadership has right now is, do you do a short [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=553.8199999999999s)]
*  term deal that leaves you more vulnerable in the future? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=558.06s)]
*  Or do you take this current situation and try to figure out a way where you can create [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=561.18s)]
*  a paradigm where your citizens will be safe and this will not happen again? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  So it's a very, very tough dilemma to be faced with if you are the leader of a country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=568.62s)]
*  So what I would do right now if I was Israel is I would try to say, number one, you want [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=573.86s)]
*  to get as many civilians out of Ra'a as possible. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=578.74s)]
*  I think that you want to try to clear that out. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=581.34s)]
*  I know that with diplomacy, maybe get them into Egypt. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=583.5s)]
*  I know that that's been refused. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=585.9000000000001s)]
*  But with the right diplomacy, I think it would be possible. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  But in addition to that, the thing that I would try to do if I was Israel right now [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=590.34s)]
*  is I would just bulldoze something in the Negev. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=594.5s)]
*  I would try to move people in there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=596.86s)]
*  I know that won't be the popular thing to do, but I think that that's a better option [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  to do so you can go in and finish the job. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=601.6600000000001s)]
*  I think there was one decision point they had. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=603.74s)]
*  Do we go into Gaza? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=605.6600000000001s)]
*  Do we not go into Gaza? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=606.6600000000001s)]
*  They had the hostages. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=607.6600000000001s)]
*  There really was, I think, no choice but to do that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=608.6600000000001s)]
*  I think that they were smart to go slowly and deliberately. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=611.4200000000001s)]
*  Gaza is booby trapped like crazy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=614.5400000000001s)]
*  They have over 400 miles of underground tunnels. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=616.46s)]
*  And so I think that they've taken some of the right steps in order to go there. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  But you have to, again, I think Israel's gone way more out of their way than a lot of other [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=623.3000000000001s)]
*  countries would to try to protect civilians from casualties. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=628.38s)]
*  But I do think right now opening up the Negev, creating a secure area there, moving the civilians [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=632.06s)]
*  out and then going in and finishing the job would be the right move. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=636.7399999999999s)]
*  Is that something that they're talking about in Israel? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=639.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the first I've really heard of somebody aside from President Sisi suggesting [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=641.5s)]
*  that the Gazans who are trying to flee the fighting could take refuge in the Negev. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=646.66s)]
*  Are people in Israel seriously talking about that possibility, about hosting Gazan refugees [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=652.42s)]
*  in what is considered, quote unquote, Israel proper? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=656.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=659.5s)]
*  But that would be something you would try to work on. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=660.54s)]
*  I'm sitting in Miami Beach right now and I'm looking at this situation and I'm just thinking [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=662.46s)]
*  what would I do if I was there? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=667.1s)]
*  And again, you look at, I mean, with Israel, it's just a different thing. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=669.06s)]
*  Right? In Syria, when there's refugees, Turkey took them, Europe took them, Jordan took them. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=673.98s)]
*  For whatever reason, here in Gaza, there's refugees from the fighting, from an offensive attack [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=678.78s)]
*  that was staged from Gaza. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=683.42s)]
*  Israel's going in to do a long-term deterrence mission. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=684.86s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that nobody's taking the refugees. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=689.14s)]
*  Again, I think that the American government should probably have done a little bit of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=692.94s)]
*  a better job to find a solution to that as a broker. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=697.38s)]
*  I think that there would have been a way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=699.82s)]
*  But if that's not a viable option, I think from Israel's perspective, it's just something [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=701.46s)]
*  that should be strongly considered. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=706.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=707.7s)]
*  I mean, you know, obviously, the reason they're not, you know, for example, the reason the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=708.7s)]
*  Egyptians don't want to take the refugees in addition to, of course, there being the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=711.5400000000001s)]
*  domestic unrest that could result or the instability that could result. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=715.9s)]
*  But also, there are real fears on the part of Arabs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=720.62s)]
*  And I'm sure you talk to a lot of them who think once Gazans leave Gaza, Netanyahu is [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=723.74s)]
*  never going to let them back in. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=729.78s)]
*  Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=733.74s)]
*  So, you know, if you think about even the construct like, you know, Gaza, Gaza was not [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=736.78s)]
*  really a historical precedent. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=741.74s)]
*  Right. It was the result of a war. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=743.1s)]
*  Right. You had tribes that were in different places. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=745.26s)]
*  But then Gaza became a thing. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=747.0600000000001s)]
*  Egypt used to run it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=749.14s)]
*  And then, you know, over time, you had different governments that came in different ways. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=750.4200000000001s)]
*  So you have another war. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=753.82s)]
*  You know, usually when wars happen, you know, borders are changed historically over time. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=755.0600000000001s)]
*  And so my sense is, is I would say, how do we deal with the terror threat that is there [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=759.62s)]
*  so that it cannot be a threat to Israel or to Egypt? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=764.46s)]
*  Right. I think that both sides are spending a fortune on military. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=767.14s)]
*  I think neither side really wants to have a terrorist organization enclave right between [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=769.58s)]
*  them. And Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable to if people would [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=774.42s)]
*  focus on kind of building up, you know, livelihoods. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=779.5s)]
*  You think about all the money that's gone into this tunnel network and into all the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=782.26s)]
*  munitions, if that would have gone into education or innovation, what could have been done? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  And so I think that it's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=789.4599999999999s)]
*  But I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=793.2199999999999s)]
*  clean it up. But I don't think that Israel has stated that they don't want the people [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=797.0999999999999s)]
*  to move back there afterwards. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, OK. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=802.06s)]
*  There's a lot to talk about there. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=804.06s)]
*  The last thing I wanted to just get your reaction to on this is the you know, you saw [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=806.26s)]
*  Tom Friedman's column on Tuesday about, you know, where he put forward a plan to get out [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=813.34s)]
*  of this. And it's called Only MBS and Biden can redirect the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=819.86s)]
*  And he says Biden should recognize the Palestinian authority unilaterally as a state and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=825.6999999999999s)]
*  MBS should go to Jerusalem like Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did in 1977. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=831.26s)]
*  And he should say, I'll normalize with Israel, I'll recognize West Jerusalem as your capital [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=835.9399999999999s)]
*  and I'll even pay to rebuild Gaza if you recognize a Palestinian state with East [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=840.62s)]
*  Jerusalem as its capital. What do you think? Good idea? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=845.62s)]
*  No, I don't think that's a good idea. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=848.42s)]
*  I think that there's certain elements of it that are correct. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=849.86s)]
*  I think proactively recognizing a Palestinian state would essentially be rewarding an act [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=852.06s)]
*  of terror that was perpetrated to Israel. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=857.66s)]
*  So it's a super bad idea in that regard. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=859.5799999999999s)]
*  The way that we did it was like a little bit inverted from there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=864.02s)]
*  Right. So when we were working on the Palestinian issue, which we spent a lot of time on [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=866.38s)]
*  and up until October 7th, the Biden administration really did not burn a lot of calories on [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=871.42s)]
*  it. They basically said this is a lost effort. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't spend time on it. But we spent a lot of time developing a plan. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=878.0999999999999s)]
*  And you go online, go Google Peace to Prosperity. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=881.66s)]
*  You'll find the plan that we put out in the White House, about 180 pages, very detailed. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=884.54s)]
*  We started out, I met with Palestinian negotiators, the Israeli negotiators, and I asked them [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=888.22s)]
*  basically a form of simple questions. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  First, identify like what are these people actually fighting over for 70 years? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=894.82s)]
*  Right. And it came down to a list of like 11 issues of which there were only really three [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=897.7s)]
*  of them. Right. One was kind of the land barrier. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=901.38s)]
*  And I kind of looked and I said, well, any outcome is kind of arbitrary, right, to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=903.9s)]
*  compromise between two positions. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=907.02s)]
*  You have the religious sites where they threw in a lot of issues like sovereignty, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=908.94s)]
*  does sovereignty belong to God? Does it belong to this? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=912.22s)]
*  You have basically two sites, one under the other, that both religions think is very [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=914.26s)]
*  critical to them. But I said, well, what do we really want if we, you know, get all the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=917.7s)]
*  technical people out of the room? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=921.58s)]
*  What we want is people to have the ability to pray freely. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=922.74s)]
*  And if you think about Israel, the Jerusalem was was really controlled by Jordan until [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=925.26s)]
*  the 1967 war. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=931.5s)]
*  Israel took over. It was a defensive war, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=932.82s)]
*  Israel was attacked by Jordan. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=934.82s)]
*  They basically came in, attacked by Egypt and Jordan. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=936.1400000000001s)]
*  Preemptive. Preemptive. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=938.94s)]
*  But Egypt was amassing all of its planes and border. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=940.82s)]
*  Jordan had given over its military under the control of the Iraqis at the time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=944.3s)]
*  And so what they did is they did a preemptive attack. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=948.22s)]
*  They knocked out the Egyptian Air Force. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=950.34s)]
*  They sent message to the Jordanians saying, please do not attack us. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=951.7s)]
*  The Jordanians started martyring, mortaring in. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=954.9s)]
*  They basically then went over. They took over Jerusalem. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=957.38s)]
*  They were surprised they got so far and they kept going and were able to go all the way to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=960.18s)]
*  the to the sea. Right. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=963.54s)]
*  So so that was kind of the history of where that was. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=964.62s)]
*  So but before then, no Jews were allowed to pray in in Jerusalem. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=967.1s)]
*  Right. And then you basically had a situation where a lot of the Jewish cemeteries, a lot of [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=972.3s)]
*  the religious sites were used as places to store animals. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=976.2199999999999s)]
*  They were they were really desecrated in bad ways. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=979.42s)]
*  Israel then wins the war. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=982.6199999999999s)]
*  Israel is a very, very poor country at the time. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=983.8599999999999s)]
*  What do they do? The first thing they do is they pass something called the protection of [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=986.54s)]
*  holy places law, which basically took money that they really didn't have at the time and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=989.2199999999999s)]
*  said, we're going to restore all the religious sites. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=992.6199999999999s)]
*  So if you think about it, from 1967 until today, Israel has been a fairly responsible [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=994.8599999999999s)]
*  steward of all these religious sites for Christians, Jews, Muslims. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=999.78s)]
*  Every now and then you have tussles when people try to make it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1002.4599999999999s)]
*  They've allowed King Abdullah to be the custodian of the mosque. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1004.98s)]
*  And if you think about that, that second issue, it's really just about allowing people to live [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1007.4599999999999s)]
*  freely. The third issue that I thought was critical was really just security. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1010.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. And you think about it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1014.38s)]
*  I mean, we think about it with different countries, but imagine you're like the governor of [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1015.62s)]
*  New Jersey and then there's people in Pennsylvania who are trying to kind of cross the border [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1018.62s)]
*  and kill your people. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1022.62s)]
*  You have to make a deal where you're making it less likely they're going to be able to harm [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1024.58s)]
*  your people than war. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to win an election and it's not [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1028.66s)]
*  a prudent thing to do. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1031.7s)]
*  So those are really only the three issues that mattered. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1032.94s)]
*  And so we did is we basically went and we said, asked each side, if you were the other [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1035.02s)]
*  side, what would you accept? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1038.5800000000002s)]
*  I found we weren't getting anywhere. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1040.5s)]
*  So I started giving them much more detailed plan to react to. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1041.66s)]
*  We started going back and forth. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1045.5s)]
*  It ended up turning into like a 50 page operational plan on how to run things. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1046.7s)]
*  And by the way, you'll find most people in politics don't want to put details out because [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1050.1000000000001s)]
*  details you get attacked when I got attacked even for taking my job. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1053.7s)]
*  So I kind of after like the third day stopped cared about being attacked. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1056.7s)]
*  So I basically said, let me start putting things out and get people to react to it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1059.5400000000002s)]
*  So that was kind of the first part, which was the political part. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1063.26s)]
*  The second thing we put together was an economic plan, because as I was progressing down that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1065.66s)]
*  road, I said, OK, let's say miraculously, I get people to agree on borders. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1069.26s)]
*  Let's say I get them to agree on a security regime. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1073.26s)]
*  And let's say I get them to agree that we could all pray properly and respect each other. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1075.14s)]
*  Then what happens the next day? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1080.66s)]
*  A lot of the region, a lot of what Israel's been used for has been a scapegoat, I believe, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1082.18s)]
*  from leaders in the region to basically deflect from their own shortcomings at home. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1087.14s)]
*  So I felt like most human beings want the ability to live a better life. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1091.42s)]
*  And if we can create an economic plan that would basically allow people to live a better [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1095.0200000000002s)]
*  life, then maybe that would give them an ability to actually start focusing on the future, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1098.66s)]
*  how to make their kids' lives better instead of focusing on how do we solve problems in [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1103.22s)]
*  the past. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1106.5800000000002s)]
*  So that was really what we put together. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1106.98s)]
*  And that was really a framework for how we thought we could make progress. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1109.34s)]
*  So what Tom's talking about is basically saying, why don't we recognize a Palestinian state? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1113.78s)]
*  When we were looking at a Palestinian state, the problem we saw there was basically that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1119.86s)]
*  they didn't have really institutions that could govern. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  The last person actually who did a good job governing there is actually here at Salam [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1128.5s)]
*  Fayyad. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1131.34s)]
*  He was doing such a good job. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1132.34s)]
*  He wasn't corrupt. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1133.58s)]
*  People were making more money. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1134.5s)]
*  The services were being delivered. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1135.54s)]
*  And he did such a good job that the leadership basically saw him as a threat and figured [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1137.02s)]
*  out how to run him out of town. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1139.98s)]
*  I don't know if I'm speaking for you, but... [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1141.46s)]
*  I think you might also say the Israelis didn't help him either. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1143.74s)]
*  But anyways, let's go. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1146.18s)]
*  The Israelis are all so complicated. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1147.18s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1149.18s)]
*  But what I would hear is that for a Palestinian state, when we looked at it, you say, what [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1150.18s)]
*  are the prerequisites that people need to live a better life? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1153.26s)]
*  Number one is you need a functioning judiciary. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  You need a business climate. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1157.74s)]
*  You need property rights. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1159.46s)]
*  You need reasons for people to invest capital in order to give people an opportunity to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1160.46s)]
*  grow. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1166.1399999999999s)]
*  And so those conditions really don't exist. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1167.1399999999999s)]
*  And so the Palestinian leadership really has not passed any of the tests over the last [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1168.82s)]
*  30 years in order to, I think, qualify for it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1173.8999999999999s)]
*  Now, I do think the notion of a Palestinian state that doesn't have the ability to harm [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1177.46s)]
*  Israel from a security perspective is a worthy objective. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1181.86s)]
*  But I think you need to figure out how do you make them earn it and at least have a [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1185.46s)]
*  viable pathway towards creating the institutions that can make it thrive and viable. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1188.94s)]
*  Because if you call it a state and then people are their lives are less good in five years [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1193.4199999999998s)]
*  from now, people will be angry and that will lead to more violence and conflict. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1198.4599999999998s)]
*  OK, so there's a lot of threads to pull on here. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1202.1s)]
*  So the first thread I just want to pull on is, you know, you offered a diagnosis for [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1204.98s)]
*  how we got to October 7th and your diagnosis is basically the Biden administration by [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1210.86s)]
*  allowing the Iran by, you know, allowing the Iranians to amass more wealth and spend it [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1216.98s)]
*  on their proxies. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1221.74s)]
*  That's how you get October 7th. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1223.3s)]
*  If President Trump had been in charge, none of that would have happened. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1225.78s)]
*  You know, the Iranians would have been continued to be starved of resources, etc. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1228.46s)]
*  Right. Am I correct? I'm correct on interpreting that hypothesis. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1233.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'll add one more element, which is they squandered momentum. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1237.66s)]
*  Yeah. And what I would say is like whether it's in business, whether it's in politics, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1240.6200000000001s)]
*  momentum is one of like the most valuable things to try to seek. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1243.9s)]
*  And it's funny, I was talking, I wrote about in my book actually with Peebee that, you [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1247.54s)]
*  know, I was with him after he lost an election, not a lost election. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1250.86s)]
*  He was trying to form a coalition. Somebody put a knife in his back and he basically lost [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1254.22s)]
*  it. And I was with him the next day. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1257.86s)]
*  We thought we were going to announce something and move forward. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1258.9399999999998s)]
*  And he was pretty despondent. And we met the next day and he was basically, you know, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1260.98s)]
*  I figured, let me ask him questions about his history, his story. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1264.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, he's a historic figure that's been through so many different iterations. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1266.6599999999999s)]
*  And he told me, you know, when I was when I was a politician, I have bad patches. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1270.4199999999998s)]
*  I would always try to get little wins because little wins lead to bigger wins and then [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1274.78s)]
*  bigger wins. And momentum is a very hard thing to get. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1277.7s)]
*  We left the region with momentum. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1280.54s)]
*  Again, the last piece. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1282.0600000000002s)]
*  So we got Bahrain to do the deal with with Israel. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1283.7s)]
*  Saudi was basically watching this all very closely. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1287.5800000000002s)]
*  We got Saudi to allow us to put flights over Saudi Arabia between Israel and UAE. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1289.9s)]
*  Then in addition to that, they've said we need you to solve the issue with us in Qatar. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  So we went through, we got that negotiation done, which was very, very intense. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1298.26s)]
*  I finished that on January 5th and then flew back to the U.S. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1301.22s)]
*  Thinking I would have a very quiet last couple of weeks in office. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1305.74s)]
*  That turned out not to be the case. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1308.1000000000001s)]
*  And and so basically everything was good. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1309.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, we basically what they could have done was then said, let's sit with Saudi. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1313.34s)]
*  Let's go finish the job. Let's finish the momentum. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1317.02s)]
*  And so they basically changed policy. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1319.5s)]
*  And I think that led to a reversion of momentum. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1322.1s)]
*  They waited two years to get started and then get a stronger Iran, less trust. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1324.4599999999998s)]
*  And I think that also contributed to it as well. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1328.8999999999999s)]
*  OK, so what would you say to the alternative hypothesis that says, actually, the reason [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1330.86s)]
*  we got October 7th is because the strategy that you had for peacemaking, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1335.22s)]
*  which, you know, whose creativity were I'm not going to question, it was quite creative. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1341.74s)]
*  But by essentially neglecting the core of the issue, the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1346.02s)]
*  Palestinians desire to determine their own fate, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1350.82s)]
*  that you just created the circumstances where, you know, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1355.34s)]
*  the the the the rejectionists would have the upper hand. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1360.7s)]
*  That this is basically not the result of, you know, Iran or whatever. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1364.38s)]
*  It's a result of the fact that, you know, the Trump administration spent four years [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1368.5800000000002s)]
*  completely ignoring, isolating, bypassing the Palestinians, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  handing them defeat after defeat after defeat. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1376.66s)]
*  And then what do you expect? You're surprised when they act out. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1379.42s)]
*  Right. So what I would say to that is that whoever would say that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1382.98s)]
*  that we didn't address the root cause of the situation, I don't think truly [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1386.5800000000002s)]
*  understood what the root cause of the situation actually is. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1390.18s)]
*  And this is what was actually so intriguing to me. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1393.5400000000002s)]
*  And what made me very insecure about my job in the beginning was that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1396.0200000000002s)]
*  I came into this with, like I said, no foreign policy experience. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  Everyone who is criticizing was probably right. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1402.38s)]
*  But I think my father-in-law, who was the president, basically said, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1404.42s)]
*  you know, it can't get any worse. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1407.74s)]
*  Like, he can't do any worse than the last people who, you know, worked on it [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1408.7800000000002s)]
*  for 10 or 15 years and all failed. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1411.6200000000001s)]
*  And then basically went and wrote books about how they didn't fail. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1413.7800000000002s)]
*  It's just that the problem was too hard. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1415.94s)]
*  And then somehow they move on and they are considered the experts on the situation, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1417.26s)]
*  having had zero accomplishments on these on this file. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1421.34s)]
*  So that's like that's the underlying function of what you're talking about. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1425.1399999999999s)]
*  I saw this very simple. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1429.5s)]
*  And actually, when I went to the United States, the UN Security Council, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1430.54s)]
*  because they're always trying to condemn Israel on everything. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1434.74s)]
*  It was very anti-Semitic, I think, the way that they conduct their business there. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1436.4599999999998s)]
*  I basically made a PowerPoint presentation. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1441.02s)]
*  I don't know if anyone's ever made them a PowerPoint presentation. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1442.62s)]
*  But coming from the business world, I said, maybe I can try to explain [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1444.6999999999998s)]
*  to these people, you know, why this is a rational thing in a very like, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1447.1s)]
*  you know, realistic place. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1450.9s)]
*  I actually put this slide in my book where I basically made a slide [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1452.06s)]
*  from Oslo Accords up until that day where I showed two lines going this way. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1455.42s)]
*  And then I had a I had a dove for every time there was a peace talk that failed. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1460.86s)]
*  And then I had a tank for every time there was a war. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1467.42s)]
*  The two lines represented the following things. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1469.78s)]
*  One was the settlements, basically the land that Israel was was taking. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1471.78s)]
*  And then the other one represented money going to the Palestinians. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1475.62s)]
*  Right. So what happened was, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1478.46s)]
*  every time a peace talk failed or a war occurred, the same two things occurred. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1480.06s)]
*  The Palestinians got more money and the Israelis took more land. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1484.42s)]
*  So both sides essentially got what they wanted. Right. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1486.8600000000001s)]
*  So neither, I thought, had really motivation to make the deal [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1489.5800000000002s)]
*  based on their own politics and their own interests. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1493.5800000000002s)]
*  And then the second thing was, is I kind of looked at and I said, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1496.06s)]
*  these issues actually are not that hard to solve. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  Which, again, a lot of people laughed at me for saying that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1501.42s)]
*  But I basically said, we have to figure out how to just kind of push this forward. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1503.7s)]
*  So when I looked at the Palestinian leadership, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1507.74s)]
*  I basically said, it's kind of like, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1509.38s)]
*  and there's a lot of other situations of refugee groups. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1511.9s)]
*  They just haven't been able to internationalize their situation. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1514.1000000000001s)]
*  The Palestinians were getting like three or four billion dollars a year [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1519.7800000000002s)]
*  in international aid. Right. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1523.0200000000002s)]
*  We had a meeting in Washington with Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1524.7s)]
*  They have like a 500 billion dollar GDP economy. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1527.2600000000002s)]
*  They're a nuclear power, military superpower, technology, you know, superpower. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1529.46s)]
*  And he would fly in on an El Al commercial plane with his team. Right. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1534.7800000000002s)]
*  We meet with the head of a refugee group, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1538.3799999999999s)]
*  Mohammed Abbas, and he would fly into Washington on a 60 million dollar [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1540.06s)]
*  Boeing business jet. I mean, the whole thing was like strange. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1543.46s)]
*  I went and I met with him one night. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1546.26s)]
*  We're talking about different issues and he wants a cigarette. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1547.74s)]
*  He puts a cigarette in his mouth and so someone comes in. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1550.7s)]
*  They like the cigarette for him. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1552.74s)]
*  I'm saying to myself, is this guy from a refugee group or is he a king? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1553.74s)]
*  And so the whole situation, I thought, was designed for them not to solve it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1557.18s)]
*  And again, a lot of people were getting rich there. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1562.3799999999999s)]
*  A lot of interests were being fed and not a lot of people were doing it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1564.22s)]
*  So what we basically said is we're going to actually address the issue. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1567.62s)]
*  We're not going to deal with the systems of the issue. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1570.6999999999998s)]
*  We're going to try to address the issue. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1572.58s)]
*  And I think that was what we actually tried to do. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1573.9799999999998s)]
*  OK, so there's a lot to pull on here, too, with respect to Mohammed Abbas. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1576.3s)]
*  So I'm going to just stipulate at the outset, some of the my favorite [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1582.5s)]
*  bits of this book are your descriptions of conversations with Mohammed Abbas. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1586.1s)]
*  And I'm not on his list of fans, but let me try to [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1590.26s)]
*  let me quote somebody who is on his list of fans, your father-in-law. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1595.9s)]
*  So he said he told Barack Ravid, you know, Abbas, I thought he was terrific. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1600.3s)]
*  He was almost like a father. Couldn't have been nicer. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1604.8200000000002s)]
*  I thought he wanted to make a deal more than Netanyahu. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1607.1000000000001s)]
*  What was your father-in-law getting wrong? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1609.94s)]
*  Well, I think it was he was saying relative. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1612.02s)]
*  OK, relative. Relative. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1614.06s)]
*  OK, relative to Netanyahu, though. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1615.5s)]
*  His view on Bibi was that Bibi was always working something. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1617.3400000000001s)]
*  And and I think that he did not have faith that Bibi would come through. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1621.54s)]
*  But I also think he was in his mind trying to kind of challenge Bibi to say, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1626.5s)]
*  you're not going to come through, you're not going to come through to kind of [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1630.98s)]
*  make Bibi kind of prove to him that he was going to come through. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1633.3s)]
*  And that was kind of the way we were setting the table. Right. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1635.58s)]
*  So what we did is we did things that we wanted to do anyway. Right. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1638.1s)]
*  President Trump campaigned that he was going to recognize Jerusalem [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1641.66s)]
*  as the capital of Israel. His view was Israel is a sovereign nation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1644.3s)]
*  America is a sovereign nation. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1647.34s)]
*  They have the right to determine their capital. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1648.42s)]
*  And we have the right to recognize their capital. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1649.82s)]
*  Right. Move the embassy to Jerusalem, Golan Heights. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1651.74s)]
*  I mean, who are you taking it from? Syria barely existed at the time. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1654.5s)]
*  Right. So and Israel had occupied it for a long time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1657.38s)]
*  Recognizing Golan wasn't that big of a deal. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1659.74s)]
*  And so we did all these things that built a lot of trust for us [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1661.9s)]
*  with the Israeli public. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1664.3400000000001s)]
*  And what happened was, is because of that, the Israeli public trusted President Trump. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1666.8200000000002s)]
*  He got out of the JCPOA. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1670.66s)]
*  He was strong on Iran. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1672.18s)]
*  And he felt that he had the ability to say this is a fair deal [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1673.5s)]
*  and push Bibi to that place. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1676.6200000000001s)]
*  Abbas would come and in the meetings, he would say, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1678.38s)]
*  we're going to do a deal with you. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1681.5s)]
*  We're going to do a special deal. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1682.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do things for you like I've never done for anybody else. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1684.18s)]
*  We're going to make a deal. We really want to do it. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1687.18s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, it's amazing. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1689.3000000000002s)]
*  So that was my first meeting. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1690.3000000000002s)]
*  I walked in and I'm like, that was incredible. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1691.22s)]
*  This guy is great. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1692.8200000000002s)]
*  Then I went for my second meeting. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1694.5s)]
*  I go all the way to Ramallah. I go in. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1695.7800000000002s)]
*  It's think myself, how is like a Jewish kid from New Jersey here in Ramallah? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1697.3000000000002s)]
*  I got all the security guards. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1700.6200000000001s)]
*  And then I meet with him again and I say, OK, I'm ready to talk like, you know, borders. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  What are we going to do? Like, what's your proposal? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1706.74s)]
*  I want you to tell me, what would you do that you think the Israeli would? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1708.1000000000001s)]
*  It would accept Jared. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1711.26s)]
*  We're going to make a deal. We're going to make the best deal. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1712.74s)]
*  I'm going to make a special deal for you. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1714.74s)]
*  I'm saying myself, I really want to get to the details here. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1715.94s)]
*  You know, I found was not a very patient person. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1718.34s)]
*  And what I found was it was kind of like a broken record. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1720.94s)]
*  And what I kind of realized, if you go back, what I did at some point, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1723.06s)]
*  I read actually Jimmy Carter's book, which was which was interesting. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1726.18s)]
*  I really want to get the full piece, not apartheid or something. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1728.62s)]
*  He's not apartheid. Yeah, I was I tried to get like everywhere from like [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1730.94s)]
*  Dorygold to Jimmy Carter. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1733.74s)]
*  Like, I really tried to get the spectrum of perspectives. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1734.98s)]
*  And in the back of it, he had in the the annex. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1738.18s)]
*  The Camp David peace agreement, I was kind of reading through the agreement. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1741.5s)]
*  I was like, you actually should go read all the different drafts of agreements [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1744.14s)]
*  and let me go read some peace agreements to see what they actually are. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1747.7s)]
*  Right. Everyone's there trying to negotiate. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1750.62s)]
*  But I said, let me go read some. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1752.54s)]
*  And so then as I pulled up all of the different agreements that have been done, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1754.26s)]
*  I saw the Arab peace initiative. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1757.14s)]
*  And that's what Abbas was said, I want to align with the Arab peace initiative. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1758.34s)]
*  And so I pulled up the Arab peace initiative and it was 10 lines [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1761.58s)]
*  and had no detail. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1764.14s)]
*  And it was a concept and it was generated, you know, in a different place. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1765.18s)]
*  And one of the tenets of it was we want a capital in East Jerusalem. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1768.62s)]
*  And so I had a guy on my team who was awesome, a guy, Scott Leath. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  He was a military guy. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1775.4199999999998s)]
*  And I said he worked for John Kerry is his whole life has been working on this issue. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1776.26s)]
*  But he was from the State Department, which was a much more [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1780.34s)]
*  a different perspective than, say, a former business guy [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1783.22s)]
*  who's more of a pragmatist would have. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1786.34s)]
*  And I asked him, I said, well, where does the Palestinian claim [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1788.9399999999998s)]
*  for East Jerusalem come from? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1791.62s)]
*  East Jerusalem as a capital, not a capital, not as belonging to the. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1794.46s)]
*  Sorry, as a cow. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1797.86s)]
*  So where does that come from? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1798.6999999999998s)]
*  And he says, I actually don't know. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1800.2199999999998s)]
*  I said, OK, we'll go go research and get back to me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1802.86s)]
*  Normally, he'd be back in my office in two hours. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1804.8999999999999s)]
*  He didn't come back for two days. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1806.9399999999998s)]
*  And he basically came back and he says, you know what, Jared, this is very interesting. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1808.5s)]
*  He said before the Palestinians kind of said that they were in charge of the West Bank, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1812.26s)]
*  right, which basically was the the declaration, which I think was in the late 80s. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1816.26s)]
*  Late 80s. Right. I think so. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1821.34s)]
*  Until then, the the Palestinian lands were basically territory of Jordan. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1823.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. Jordan, the Palestinians were basically fighting with the Jordanians, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1827.02s)]
*  causing problems there, and the Jordanians basically said, we've had enough of these people. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1831.54s)]
*  Let's get them out of here. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1834.5s)]
*  And they basically exiled Yasser Arafat to Lebanon, where he went there, caused a lot of trouble. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1835.22s)]
*  They exiled him to Tunisia. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1839.26s)]
*  So during that time, when the Palestinians were in the West Bank, their capital was Amman. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1841.06s)]
*  So he's saying, like, actually, it was just through this declaration of the Palestinians [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1846.34s)]
*  when they said, this is how we're forming our charter. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1849.66s)]
*  This is what our rights are. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1852.06s)]
*  They just said, and we're taking East Jerusalem as our capital. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1853.06s)]
*  So it was just one of these things that kind of came down. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1855.7800000000002s)]
*  Declaring East Jerusalem as their capital. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1858.0200000000002s)]
*  Declaring. Yeah. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1859.8200000000002s)]
*  In other words, East Jerusalem was always going to be part of what a Palestinian state was [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1860.7s)]
*  because they had never ceded it. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1865.42s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1866.98s)]
*  Apart. OK. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1867.9s)]
*  What I would say about that, and this is also another notion, is that, again, because there's a lot of [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1868.8200000000002s)]
*  you'll hear people say, throw around a lot of words like they'll throw apartheid or [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1873.0600000000002s)]
*  Jerusalem, but my view is these words are like always up here. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1877.38s)]
*  And then, again, somebody who wasn't part of the club of foreign policy experts, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1880.5400000000002s)]
*  I said, well, explain this to me. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1884.62s)]
*  East Jerusalem, the boundaries of East Jerusalem have changed like eight times over the course of history as well. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1886.1s)]
*  So when they were saying that, I said, well, there's no way we could expand East Jerusalem, give them a different part of it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1890.9799999999998s)]
*  So it's one of these things that if you're pragmatic about it, there's ways to solve a lot of these different issues if you want to do it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1895.3s)]
*  And what we found with Abbas was that there wasn't a great desire to engage because he was protecting the status quo, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1901.78s)]
*  which was leading to lots of inflows of money. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1908.9399999999998s)]
*  OK, so I do not want to be the guy defending Abbas. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1911.06s)]
*  But to just make this interesting, let me offer you the alternative argument. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1914.18s)]
*  First of all, there's a really amazing negotiator who said you always let the other guy go first. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1920.98s)]
*  Who was that? Oh, it was Jared Kushner. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1926.3s)]
*  It's in this book. OK, so you go to Abbas and you say, hey, draw a map for me. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1928.1000000000001s)]
*  A smart negotiator is going to say, hey, the map is resolution 242. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1932.7s)]
*  OK, the entire West Bank. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1936.78s)]
*  If you've got an offer you want to make, go ahead. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1938.6200000000001s)]
*  But I'm certainly not going to negotiate against myself. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1942.1399999999999s)]
*  Why didn't you recognize that that's what he was doing? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1945.06s)]
*  Yeah, so that's what I saw was this situation. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1947.82s)]
*  So what I did was since both parties were doing that, I just went and started drawing my own map. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1950.3799999999999s)]
*  And I basically said, OK, I don't really care what happened before. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1954.98s)]
*  Because if you think about the Middle East, a lot of it's just arbitrary lines drawn by foreigners anyway. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1958.5s)]
*  Right. You go back to Sykes-Picot and you could argue that there's a lot of there's a lot of lines. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1963.22s)]
*  Again, as I started unraveling this history, I was realizing that a lot of this was not as as logical or sacrosanct as everyone thought it was. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1968.54s)]
*  So so what I basically said is I said, OK, let me come up with a 2017 version. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1978.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. What I'm basically going to do is look at, say, if you go back to 2006, Israel unilaterally withdrew all of their settlers from Gaza. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1983.14s)]
*  And it was a political disaster. What did they get for it? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1990.3s)]
*  They left all these greenhouses. They left all this industry. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1993.3s)]
*  It was all destroyed. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1995.58s)]
*  They ended up with a group with a terrorist group took over. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1996.86s)]
*  And then since then, they've been firing rockets into Israel. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=1999.86s)]
*  And Israel has been less safe because of their withdrawal. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2001.98s)]
*  And October 7th proved that. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2004.06s)]
*  But this was even before that, I said, there is no way Israel is uprooting any of these settlers. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2005.7s)]
*  So I said, let me just say, if I want to give the Palestinians a state, let me figure out how can I draw a line and just take all the places where there are settlers and just make a new line here and then figure out how do you swap land here and there and then make whatever is not contiguous, continuous. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2010.02s)]
*  Today you've got tunnels, you've got bridges, all these different things. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2023.94s)]
*  How do you make it connectable so that it can be a functioning state and then go from there? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2026.94s)]
*  So I started drawing a line. And then I figured I'd let each party react to it one way or the other. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2030.7800000000002s)]
*  We ended up putting it out. Again, I fought a lot with Bibi and his team. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2034.94s)]
*  I threw it to show them the map. You can't have this. You can't have that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2038.22s)]
*  I said, OK, let's move the line here and there. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2041.14s)]
*  But that was how I started. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2043.14s)]
*  I was never able to get the Palestinians to engage off of that map to say, we want this, but. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2044.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So this is interesting. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2050.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you're a great negotiator. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2052.1s)]
*  I'm a fat professor who's never even negotiated his salary properly. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2054.5s)]
*  But, you know, so but but. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2057.5s)]
*  That's usually what the people who are doing well say. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2060.7s)]
*  You know, you know, but but but the the the way you present, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2062.46s)]
*  I did think it was you really deserve a lot of credit for getting Benjamin Netanyahu to put down on paper [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2067.7799999999997s)]
*  the borders of a Palestinian state that he would accept. OK. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2074.8199999999997s)]
*  You're the first person to really get them to do that. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2078.3399999999997s)]
*  Not just him. You got the opposition during a heated election to agree to agree to it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2081.54s)]
*  To agree to a massive step forward. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2085.78s)]
*  Massive step forward. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2087.46s)]
*  And one of the great things that you say in this book, by the way, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2088.58s)]
*  which I actually think is exculpatory of the Palestinians, as you say, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2091.26s)]
*  everybody says Camp David 2000, the Palestinians walked away from a really detailed agreement. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2095.34s)]
*  There wasn't a detailed agreement. Right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2099.94s)]
*  So that's actually a little bit exculpatory for the Palestinians. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2101.7s)]
*  But in any case, you finally get Benjamin Netanyahu to put down on paper his what he will accept. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2104.5s)]
*  And just from my research, I was not able to find like any text of a deal that was anywhere near close to a negotiation. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2111.22s)]
*  I also thought the power dynamics were different, where is what I was told is that Arafat was basically not being supported by the Arabs. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2117.1s)]
*  The Arabs wanted to keep this thing alive and they didn't want him to make a deal. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2124.98s)]
*  Whereas today, you know, when we got in, I recognized a different dynamic where kind of the Arabs, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2129.06s)]
*  I felt, wanted him to finish this, which gave me a lot more ability to lean into things. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2133.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's interesting. So so. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2137.46s)]
*  But the point is, so you've got now Benjamin Netanyahu's drawn the map. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2139.66s)]
*  Why do you why do you take this to Abbas or why do you announce this as the American plan to which the Israelis have signed on? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2143.62s)]
*  Like you are, you know, the American, you're you've got this position as the broker between these two parties. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2151.7799999999997s)]
*  Why didn't you go back to Abbas and say, OK, here's what the here's the Israeli position and then Abbas say, OK, no, I don't like this border. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2159.98s)]
*  I don't like that. And then why didn't you do it that way? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2168.62s)]
*  Why did you why did you present it in such a way where it looked like what you were trying to do was to give him an offer he couldn't accept so that you could then say to the other Arabs, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2171.1s)]
*  this guy's a rejectionist. I did my best. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2181.94s)]
*  Can we now conclude some peace deals directly between you and the Israelis and leave these Palestinians on the side? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2183.86s)]
*  I'll try to do this answer as short as possible, but it's going to be a little one. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2190.94s)]
*  So, OK, number one, what I tried to do is set up the situation. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2193.74s)]
*  So when we moved the embassy to Jerusalem, Abbas and his team said, we're not talking to you guys anymore. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2197.02s)]
*  After a couple of months, they came back. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2202.22s)]
*  We kept the security cooperation going, but he broke ties with us diplomatically. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2203.62s)]
*  And I remember at the time, Rex Tillerson, who was the secretary of state, said, we've got to go do something. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2207.58s)]
*  Let's give them East Jerusalem. Let's do this because these guys are going to run away and we're not going to we're not going to hear from them again for another decade. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2211.94s)]
*  And I said, Rex, we're not doing it. He said, why? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2218.1s)]
*  I said, they've trained American negotiators over time to say jump and we say how high. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2220.42s)]
*  I read that in the book and I thought that was an extraordinary. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2226.42s)]
*  Give me an example of where we said to the Palestinians when the Palestinians told us jump and we did it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2229.18s)]
*  They always everything with me was a threat. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2236.38s)]
*  We're going to withdraw from the negotiation. I said, who cares? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2238.62s)]
*  We give you guys 700 million dollars a year. I don't care. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2241.98s)]
*  Like, my view is if you're going to come and do it, great. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2244.46s)]
*  If not, we're going to stop funding you guys. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2246.38s)]
*  But that's how we're going to set the dynamic. OK. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2248.2599999999998s)]
*  But then the second thing I did was I said, we're not going to allow you to control whether we can negotiate this or not. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2250.06s)]
*  So because they withdrew, I said, OK, I could stop. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2256.9s)]
*  Now, the good news is I had other files to work on. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2259.46s)]
*  I wasn't a sole person. But the reason why the US were trained to chase them is usually it was an envoy who sold job. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2261.22s)]
*  It was to deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2266.54s)]
*  And the Palestinians said, we're not negotiating. He had nothing to do for me. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2268.7s)]
*  I said, OK, I'll work on other things. That's OK. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2272.1s)]
*  I have other jobs here. And so what we basically did was we went and we started pushing forward with the plan. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2274.3s)]
*  And my thinking was, as I was speaking to the Arabs, they said, get an honest plan on paper from Israel and we will try to push the Palestinians to take it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2279.98s)]
*  Right. Because they basically we want this thing resolved. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2288.34s)]
*  So if they said if you can put a credible offer and they did not believe that we can get Bibi or United Israel to put forward a credible plan, I said, good, let's do it again. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2290.9s)]
*  I was always willing to chase the crazy things. And I kind of liked it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2298.86s)]
*  So it was it was. And again, I felt like this was very important. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2301.7s)]
*  Yeah. So so going after it and trying to settle things, I thought was was critical. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2305.7400000000002s)]
*  So we worked hard with Israel. We kept negotiating with them to get them more and more. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  I didn't take them all the way to where I thought we could have gone. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2313.66s)]
*  Security wise, I was in full agreement with everything we put in our plan. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2316.58s)]
*  Again, I really was very sympathetic to Israel. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2320.06s)]
*  You can't make a peace deal and then be less safe the next day. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2323.06s)]
*  Right. You do a deal so that you're more safe. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2325.74s)]
*  So that was number one. The borders, I felt like we should just be super pragmatic about it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2327.22s)]
*  And there was a couple of things in there that I knew we could swap around. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2332.46s)]
*  So I left some meat on the bone for a boss. I'm going to get to the answer to your question. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2335.02s)]
*  So so I kind of left some meat on the bone. Then when we announced the plan. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2338.5s)]
*  So first of all, we surprised everyone by getting Israel to put out a very detailed plan. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2342.42s)]
*  We had a unified Israeli government supporting it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2346.86s)]
*  We got very positive statements from the Arab countries saying we encourage both sides [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2349.26s)]
*  to negotiate on this basis on the basis of this plan, which diplomatically was actually a very big step forward [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2353.14s)]
*  in the diplomatic world. Right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2357.94s)]
*  Then what I did is I had the CIA deliver to a boss a copy of the plan with a note from us right beforehand, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2359.94s)]
*  basically saying, this is the plan we're putting out. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2365.82s)]
*  We have built a lot of goodwill with Israel. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2370.7000000000003s)]
*  We are willing to use that goodwill to try to make a fair deal that we think can resolve this. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2373.02s)]
*  That's the question I'm asking. So why why why that framing? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2377.2200000000003s)]
*  Why didn't you say, here's what the Israelis are offering. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2380.3s)]
*  Let's show give me your counter offer. Why didn't you do that? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2382.78s)]
*  That's essentially what the letter said. Right. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2386.6200000000003s)]
*  The letter basically from the president said, you know, we're happy to chat. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2388.6200000000003s)]
*  And we basically, you know, we said, look, we're happy to chat. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2391.5s)]
*  We're moving forward. This. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2393.86s)]
*  We had to set the dynamic where the train was moving forward with or without him. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2394.74s)]
*  And this is what I do believe, too. Right. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2398.02s)]
*  They were very isolated. They were basically running out of cash. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2400.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. Iran was running out of cash. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2403.74s)]
*  And we had the only thing on the table, the Abraham Accords, were now starting to collapse the pocket around them. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2405.8199999999997s)]
*  And so basically what we were doing is we were trying to eliminate all of his escape, escape paths and build a golden bridge. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2411.3799999999997s)]
*  And then basically, at some point, we figured he'd go over the bridge. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2417.3799999999997s)]
*  I feel like what if I mean, I feel like the natural response to that is, you know, very clever dealmaking. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2420.62s)]
*  I certainly would not want to be on the opposite side of a real estate transaction with you. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2426.02s)]
*  But what you weren't recognizing is that Abbas has people to his right. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2429.7s)]
*  He's got Hamas that he's got to contend with. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2434.74s)]
*  And you were just making it absolutely impossible for him to make a deal with you. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2438.06s)]
*  And all you were doing here is just grooving the rejectionist point and making the average Palestinian think, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2442.86s)]
*  yeah, absolutely, that America has no intention of actually being an honest broker or getting us a good deal. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2450.5s)]
*  Look what they're doing to Abbas, who is their ally. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2455.66s)]
*  So then maybe the only path is the path of this violent resistance. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2459.46s)]
*  So I hope you're saying that in the context of being provocative or just because my sense is that's like the total conventional way of thinking about this. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2465.1s)]
*  And again, I'm saying this like openly, like I was criticized by all the conventional players on this because I did not approach this. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2473.34s)]
*  It happened. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2479.74s)]
*  Right. But let me go back to that point. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2480.7s)]
*  So the point there is that the other version of what that was said is that if you move the embassy to Jerusalem, the Middle East is going to have a war. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2482.54s)]
*  That was the U.S. intelligence assessment. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2489.8599999999997s)]
*  That was what Abbas said. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2491.98s)]
*  That's what every leader in the region said. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2493.7s)]
*  If you get out of the JCPOA, the world's going to end. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2495.54s)]
*  If you move the embassy, the world's going to end. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2498.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, every time we did one of those things, we worked to mitigate the risk. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2501.02s)]
*  And you know what happened the next day? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2503.66s)]
*  The sun rose in the morning and it set in the evening. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2505.02s)]
*  And nothing happened. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2507.58s)]
*  OK, we had a little things. We managed them. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2508.9s)]
*  It was no big deal. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2510.42s)]
*  So our thinking was is that if you're going to say that Abbas can't engage with us and try to make a compromise because Hamas is to his other side, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2511.5s)]
*  we thought the best way to empower him over Hamas was to make him the guy who delivered investment, upside, compromise, better life for the people. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2522.06s)]
*  And that's that's how we read the situation back in 2019, 2020. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2532.26s)]
*  And I still believe at that moment, our assessment was correct. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2537.14s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I want to move on to other issues, but I just want to like, you know, when I look at the way you negotiated with Bibi. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2539.58s)]
*  OK, so you mentioned, for example, the the the move to move the embassy to Jerusalem, for example, like every time you made one of these decisions and President Trump would say, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2546.94s)]
*  hey, what am I getting for this? You want me to move the embassy to Jerusalem? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2557.8599999999997s)]
*  What's Bibi going to give me? Oh, you want me to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2560.3799999999997s)]
*  I've already done enough for Bibi. Why am I going to do this? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2564.7s)]
*  And every time you would say to the president, hey, hey, hey, we're building capital with the Israelis, we're building capital with Bibi. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2566.9s)]
*  Wow. Why weren't you trying to build capital with the Palestinians? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2574.26s)]
*  You know, first of all, Israel was the much stronger party. Right. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2578.1800000000003s)]
*  And so at the end of the day, we felt like getting the right pragmatic compromises out of them would take the capital. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2582.02s)]
*  And we would have to convince them that the compromises we were going to ask them to take, we we genuinely believed were in their interests. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2588.78s)]
*  Keep in mind, all of the things we did for Bibi were things that we thought were the right things to do. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2595.82s)]
*  So he was a political beneficiary of the beneficiary of them. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2599.78s)]
*  He would tout them for his domestic and international popularity. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2603.86s)]
*  But the reality is, is we were doing things that we thought were the right things to do. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2607.26s)]
*  Why didn't you at least you why didn't you at least get him to free settlements, say, like, hey, I'm going to give you Jerusalem. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2610.82s)]
*  I'm going to recognize the Golan. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2615.6200000000003s)]
*  If you notice with us, the settlements were basically contained to areas. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2617.94s)]
*  I mean, he did he did pro forma stuff, but nothing that was that radical. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2621.7000000000003s)]
*  He didn't go too crazy with us in the settlements. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2624.66s)]
*  OK, but again, our strategy was basically have the tough conversations quietly, figure out how to mitigate. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2626.58s)]
*  Again, you could have disagreement, but let's focus on the big things. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2633.2999999999997s)]
*  I remember I got a call from David Friedman, who's our ambassador to Israel, and so Jared, we have to deal with this. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2636.18s)]
*  You know, two Israelis were still. I said, David, I said, stop chasing rabbits. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2642.2999999999997s)]
*  I said, our job is not to solve every single domestic Israeli issue. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2646.1s)]
*  Our job is to focus on the elephants. Right. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2649.42s)]
*  The elephants are slower. They're bigger. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2651.5s)]
*  Let's focus on the root cause of this. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2653.22s)]
*  If we solve the root causes of the disease, the symptoms all go away. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2654.8199999999997s)]
*  If you spend all of your time chasing the symptoms, you're going to wear yourself out. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2659.06s)]
*  You're not going to get anywhere. And that's what a lot of people did before us. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2662.46s)]
*  So we stayed very laser focused on how do we make both sides uncomfortable to try and create an outcome. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2665.1s)]
*  And I'll just say this, too. I mean, the Middle East peace is like a butt of jokes for many years. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2670.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. We actually did get some peace agreements done, which was pretty incredible. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2675.4199999999996s)]
*  But I mean, you're basically saying like, Jared, go work on probably one of the most impossible, complex, emotional, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2678.58s)]
*  emotionally charged problem sets in the history of the world. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2684.86s)]
*  And so my view was it's like it wasn't like you could look at it on one of your homework sets, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2689.9s)]
*  get this the right answer, the wrong answer. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2693.66s)]
*  You have like a million different wrong answers and maybe like one or two potential answers that could work out well. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2695.14s)]
*  And so, like I said, we inherited the hand we got and we just played the cards as hard as we could. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2700.94s)]
*  And I do think by the time we left, we left it in a very, very strong place. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2706.86s)]
*  And had we had more time, again, I don't want to sound like one of these guys who leaves government saying this, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2710.2200000000003s)]
*  but I did have a lot of track. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2713.9s)]
*  My track record of success in the Middle East, I do think is second to none over the last many years. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2715.94s)]
*  And so I do firmly believe that we put the situation in a paradigm where it was much closer to being solved than it had ever been before. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2721.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to just do one last question on Bibi, because, you know, I started this by saying you and your father-in-law [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2730.26s)]
*  disagree about, I bet you also disagree about Bibi. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2736.42s)]
*  And I guess what I'm trying to understand, because, you know, I've read your book, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2741.3s)]
*  I don't know why you still have a soft spot for Bibi. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2744.9s)]
*  Like this is a guy who, you know, Trump says, I don't think he ever wanted to make peace. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2748.1s)]
*  You tell a story where Netanyahu acts incredibly dishonorably, where, you know, when you're rolling out the peace plan, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2753.2200000000003s)]
*  he gets up and just starts thanking the United States for agreeing to Israeli annexation of these bits of the West Bank [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2761.8599999999997s)]
*  that Israel, in your plan, would only get after the deal is agreed to by the other side. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2768.66s)]
*  And, you know, you even say, like, when you first started talking to Netanyahu about a deal, he says, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2774.58s)]
*  no thanks, and you even know it. He says to you, look, I've survived by prime minister, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2780.74s)]
*  as prime minister for 11 years, by opposing a Palestinian state. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2784.8199999999997s)]
*  So this, to me, is a guy who just purely in your book seems pretty sneaky, kind of like an obstructionist, a rejectionist. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2789.38s)]
*  And yet you talk about him in the book, towards the end, you say he could be a powerful catalyst for change. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2796.5800000000004s)]
*  And I'm thinking to myself, yeah, he's a, you know, it seems to me he was more an obstacle to the kind of change [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2803.1400000000003s)]
*  that you wanted and the U.S. wanted, which was to see a solution to the Palestinian issue. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2809.1400000000003s)]
*  So what am I and your father-in-law getting wrong about this guy? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2813.78s)]
*  So first of all, I think that there definitely is brilliance to him, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2817.78s)]
*  And I think he's definitely committed himself to Israel for a very long time. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2820.9s)]
*  Some would argue maybe now too long, but he's, but I think he's done a lot of good in his time. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2824.7400000000002s)]
*  And my general view is I was able to find ways to work things through with him. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2830.1s)]
*  He didn't always make my life easy, but that wasn't his job. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2833.7000000000003s)]
*  My job wasn't to make his life easy either. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2836.1800000000003s)]
*  So again, I understood his complications. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2838.02s)]
*  I understood his flaws and I understood his brilliance. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2840.98s)]
*  And I just found it, and again, maybe I'm more malleable. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2844.82s)]
*  I'm able to work with complicated people very well. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2848.1s)]
*  That's maybe one of the things throughout all my different careers I've been good at. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2850.26s)]
*  But I found that I was able to get the best out of him in order to accomplish the things [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2854.18s)]
*  that I thought were in the best interests of America and the region. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2859.46s)]
*  Okay. So in other words, just bottom line on this, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2864.02s)]
*  you are not one of the people who sees Benjamin Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2866.02s)]
*  I think that anyone who is a leader in the region can be both part of the problem and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2870.9s)]
*  part of the solution. And I think that the job of those involved is to try to pull [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2876.9s)]
*  the best out of everyone to create the best possible outcome possible. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2882.1s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely- [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2886.18s)]
*  I know I'm being a little levaso with that, but I think it really can depend on the day. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2887.62s)]
*  And I think it depends on how you work with him to get the best out of him. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2891.46s)]
*  No, I love- [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2894.02s)]
*  It's in there. It's in there. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2894.5s)]
*  I love that. I love that. It's just, it's clear from the book. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2895.54s)]
*  You did that with Netanyahu, but you gave up on Abbas really quickly. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2898.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't give up. I was just taking a posture of, we're not going to chase you. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2903.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2907.7s)]
*  But I left, I think for him, I set a very delicious table where if he would have come [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2908.8999999999996s)]
*  and engaged, I had a couple of goodies in my pocket that I could have gone. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2915.22s)]
*  And I think I set the table for him to make a deal, have some big victories in negotiation, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2918.2599999999998s)]
*  have $50 billion of investment, create a million new jobs, double the GDP, reduce the poverty rate, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2925.22s)]
*  trade like a real country. You know what I mean? So I think I set him up to be a hero. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2932.74s)]
*  There's one book I read about him, which actually I had a different assessment of him than the CIA. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2939.22s)]
*  And I actually bought this book and gave it to the CIA after I read it, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2943.7s)]
*  which was called The Last Palestinian, which was really incredible. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2947.2999999999997s)]
*  And throughout his life, again, this is my assessment as just somebody who ended up in this job, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2951.86s)]
*  was that throughout his life, he actually was for peace. He was for nonviolence. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2959.0600000000004s)]
*  He hung around a lot of bad characters and was always on that side. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2963.1400000000003s)]
*  But I do think that after they lost Gaza to Hamas in 2006, you basically had two non-states with [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2966.26s)]
*  two non-governments. And I think after that, he just went inward and his whole focus moved to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2973.86s)]
*  survival and staying in power and keeping the kleptocracy running. And I think after that, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2979.7s)]
*  it was more about how do I set this up to just survive? And he became afraid of making peace [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2985.2999999999997s)]
*  and taking the risks necessary. So that was kind of my assessment, which made him a little bit of [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2991.8599999999997s)]
*  a harder character to deal with. We could probably talk about him for much longer, but we shouldn't. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=2995.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, I want to, you saw the Vanity Fair story that talks about you as a potential future [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3001.7799999999997s)]
*  Secretary of State. I don't know if people saw the New York Sun story from January that proposed [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3007.3s)]
*  your name for president of Harvard. But so what I want to do is I kind of want to get your, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3012.02s)]
*  I want to understand kind of how you think about international relations. And the Golan story gives [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  us a nice entry point into that. So, you know, March 2019, you encouraged President Trump to [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3023.3s)]
*  recognize Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. And you say, basically you say, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3031.62s)]
*  acknowledging the reality that the Golan Heights belong to Israel was the right thing to do. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3039.94s)]
*  Now, remember I read that thing and I thought, wow, you know, Jared Kushner is talking about [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3046.42s)]
*  the right thing to do. I'm a realist in international relations. I would have guessed that you were as [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3050.74s)]
*  well. It's like, there's no right or wrong. It's like interests. So what was the moral principle [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3055.94s)]
*  that was being satisfied by recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan? Sure. So even with all [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3060.82s)]
*  these jobs, my number one job that I'm focused on right now is being dad to my kids. That's something [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3067.46s)]
*  after four years of very intense time in government that's the most important job I have now. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3072.42s)]
*  That's your way of saying you don't want to be Secretary of State. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3079.1400000000003s)]
*  My job, that's my way of saying like I'm really liking the job I have right now. It's really [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3081.54s)]
*  important. So what I would say is that the way that I kind of approach foreign policy, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3085.86s)]
*  and again this came from not really having any experience in foreign policy, was basically saying [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3092.02s)]
*  every problem set I got, I think my disadvantage was that I didn't have any [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3097.06s)]
*  context and my advantage was that I didn't have any context. So I would always try to take a first [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3101.7799999999997s)]
*  principles result oriented approach with the goal of being how do you maximize human potential. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3106.58s)]
*  And in order to maximize human potential, you need to figure out how you can reduce conflict [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3113.54s)]
*  most of the time. And I always looked at everything and I say through that lens, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3118.02s)]
*  like you know what are the interests of different parties. One thing I was also very good at, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3122.02s)]
*  I think because I didn't come in lecturing people, there's a story I tell in the book where I went to [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3125.7s)]
*  meet with Mohammed bin Zayed, who's now the President of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3128.9s)]
*  And I spent the first two hours basically asking him different forms of a question, which is [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3133.7799999999997s)]
*  the U.S. has so much power. Again, we're a massive global superpower. If you were me, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3139.62s)]
*  what would you do? And it took him about an hour to basically understand the question I was doing [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3145.94s)]
*  because he was so not programmed to actually meet with somebody from the U.S. who wanted his opinion. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3150.74s)]
*  And after an amazing conversation, because he's a very, very wise and brilliant person, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3156.2599999999998s)]
*  he basically said to me, he says, you know Jared, I think you're going to make peace here in the [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3161.7799999999997s)]
*  region. I said to him, I said, well, why do you say that? He says, well, the U.S. usually sends one [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3164.34s)]
*  of three kinds of people to see us. The first are somebody who comes and they fall asleep in meetings. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3168.58s)]
*  He says, the second type of person they send is somebody who comes and they read me notes or a [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3174.02s)]
*  message and has no like authority or power to interact and have a dialogue. He said, the third [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3178.26s)]
*  person they send are people with real authority, but they only really send them to come and try [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3184.58s)]
*  to convince me to do things that are not in my interest. He says, you're the first person from [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3189.06s)]
*  the U.S. at a senior level that's ever come here and actually asked questions and listened. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3192.98s)]
*  I said to him, well, that's because I really don't know how to do this and this is a really [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3198.34s)]
*  hard problem. I said, I appreciate all of the wisdom and you can give me. It's kind of a long [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3202.7400000000002s)]
*  way of saying that every problem I kind of looked at fresh, I was able to build trust with people, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3208.1s)]
*  build real personal relationships. I always answered the phone. People had issues. I always [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3214.7400000000002s)]
*  believed successful people answer their phone. I was always available. I didn't always tell them [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3219.54s)]
*  yes. I wasn't keeping a score saying, I'm going to do this for you, but you have to do this for me. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3224.18s)]
*  My general view was, I'm going to do all the things you need and you're going to do all the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3228.34s)]
*  things I need. Hopefully, at the end of this relationship, we both feel like we're way ahead. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3231.7799999999997s)]
*  So, I was able to build a lot of trust. I was able to kind of see things from another side's [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3236.02s)]
*  perspective. I worked very hard to understand both sides' interests and say, where can we find [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3241.78s)]
*  common interests? And then the areas where we disagreed, instead of condemning people publicly, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3249.5400000000004s)]
*  you'll notice I didn't do a lot of public talking. I didn't think it was that helpful. I'm not very [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3253.6200000000003s)]
*  big on being negative towards people or being critical. And so, what I basically did was we [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3257.7000000000003s)]
*  would find ways when we disagreed to disagree respectfully and quietly and then find ways to [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3262.9s)]
*  move forward. So, sorry, recognizing Golan's annexation was the right thing to do because? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3267.78s)]
*  Well, it's just obvious. I mean, number one, Israel had had it now for how many years? I guess they [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3273.7000000000003s)]
*  got into the 73 war? Yes, I believe. So, they- 67, I don't remember. They had it for a long time, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3278.02s)]
*  the 67 war. Yeah. Yeah, the 67 war. So, they basically had it since the 67 war. Clearly, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3283.6200000000003s)]
*  strategically, it was a big military important. They had it. They weren't given. Then they're [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3289.86s)]
*  saying, okay, who does it belong to? Syria. I mean, Syria at the time barely existed. So, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3293.78s)]
*  it was a big thing where it said, A, they're never giving it up, B, Syria doesn't exist. Let's just [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3297.7000000000003s)]
*  recognize it. It moves things forward. And my view is like the more of these, what I would call kind [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3302.82s)]
*  of like stupid conflicts that we allowed to exist, the more it would be there. And then what I would [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3308.1000000000004s)]
*  say too is like the Middle East has a lot of natural negative inertia to it, right? It's been [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3314.82s)]
*  created over so many years. Maybe it's the mixture of so many customs and traditions. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3319.54s)]
*  But I would say in like 2017, what was new to the situation was really two things. One was [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3323.7s)]
*  President Trump and myself as a proxy, and then MBS, right? And so, with those two dynamics, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3329.14s)]
*  we were able to disrupt the inertia and then really change the paradigm of what was there. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3334.34s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you have this other line in the book where you say, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3340.1s)]
*  recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan was a powerful opportunity for America to stand for [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3342.9s)]
*  the truth. Yeah. But that felt like very moral language. For example, I don't imagine you would [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3347.78s)]
*  say, oh, let's also stand for the truth of the fact that the one China policy doesn't make any [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3355.2200000000003s)]
*  sense and there actually should be an independent country called Taiwan. You wouldn't stand for that [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3361.2200000000003s)]
*  truth. Yeah. Well, I think that that was a truth that didn't conflict with one of our strategic [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3364.9s)]
*  interests. Okay. Fair enough. Okay. But I'll tell you where we did do that, right? We [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3371.1400000000003s)]
*  did that in the Western Sahara. Yeah. We recognized the Western Sahara as being part of Morocco, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3377.7s)]
*  because again, we thought that was in our interests and it was true. And so, it was just like one of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3383.3799999999997s)]
*  these. And again, that has not been undone too. One thing I'm proud of with a lot of the work I [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3387.46s)]
*  did in government, people talk about how it was a divided time. Abraham Accords have been bipartisan [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3391.14s)]
*  praised. Now, the Biden administration has followed our policy. After two years, they've reversed [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3397.06s)]
*  course. They're embracing Saudi Arabia. All the things we're doing, they're now trying to do, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3401.14s)]
*  which is, I think, a great affirmation of the policy. And it's good. The prison reform we did, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3404.5s)]
*  87 votes in the Senate. You look at the USMCA trade deal. So, my view is if you pursue the things in [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3410.1s)]
*  the right way and you build consensus, you actually can move forward big things. So, Western Sahara, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3416.5s)]
*  we did the right thing and we were able to then work hard to convince everyone to come on board. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3420.74s)]
*  Okay. We're coming to the time where I have to take questions for the students. Otherwise, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3425.06s)]
*  I will not make it out of here alive. But I wanted to ask you just one last issue I wanted to [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3430.18s)]
*  describe. You talk about yourself as trying to move big things forward. Another person trying [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3435.2999999999997s)]
*  to move big things forward who is a friend of yours is Mohammed bin Salman and I think the [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3439.22s)]
*  crown prince of Saudi Arabia. And I think you and I are in agreement that he's probably one of the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3444.5s)]
*  most consequential people in the world right now in terms of the magnitude of what he's trying to [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3448.8199999999997s)]
*  do and in terms of how important it is for the world that he succeed. But I think when I look at [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3453.54s)]
*  him and what he's trying to do, there are some things that just kind of give me pause. And I'm [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3460.2599999999998s)]
*  asking you as a friend of his to help me understand why these things shouldn't give me pause. So, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3465.46s)]
*  I'm totally going to overlook the Gamal Khashoggi thing or the detention of the [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3471.3s)]
*  Lebanese prime minister or the Ritz Carlton. Just looking at some of the developmental plans, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3481.06s)]
*  like the line, which is this 100 mile long linear city. And you're a real estate guy. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3486.8199999999997s)]
*  Does the line make sense to you? I look at this and I think this seems to me like a guy who's got [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3493.54s)]
*  a lot of testosterone and nobody who wants to tell him no. What am I getting wrong? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3499.2999999999997s)]
*  So, he definitely has very high RPMs. From the first time I met him, so the way I'll give a [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3505.46s)]
*  little bit of context. So, Mohammed Salman is now the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3511.3799999999997s)]
*  When we were in the campaign in 2016, Trump was very tough on Saudi. And then I write in my book, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3516.3399999999997s)]
*  if you want to go through and read, I was very, very rough with them when they came in trying to [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3522.98s)]
*  speak. And I said, look, we want nothing to do with you guys. You guys fund terrorism, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3526.02s)]
*  you treat women terribly, you're not ascribing to Western values, you got to pay for your own [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3529.06s)]
*  defense, you got to recognize Israel, we're done. This is going to be a very rough go. And they did [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3533.06s)]
*  not get along with Obama because Obama basically went to Persia and did the deal with Iran, which [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3537.86s)]
*  made all of our allies feel very alienated. So, they basically came back and said, no, no, no, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3542.34s)]
*  we really, really value the US relationship. It's been our strongest relationship forever. And we [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3546.98s)]
*  have this young deputy crown prince who really wants to go forward and make a difference here, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3550.9s)]
*  and he wants to change things. And so then basically, we had a big debate internally, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3555.7s)]
*  and he sent me a whole proposal through his guys, Dr. Fahd Al-Tuzi and Dr. Masada Liban. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3560.66s)]
*  And they basically brought a proposal that basically said, we're going to do all these [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3566.8999999999996s)]
*  modernizations, we're going to get rid of the custodianship laws, we're going to start allowing [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3569.8599999999997s)]
*  women drive. And by the way, we're not doing this for you. We're doing this because we want to do [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3572.8999999999996s)]
*  it. We're going to be eliminating the role of the religious police. At the time, we had the Pulse [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3575.94s)]
*  nightclub shooting, we had the San Bernardino shooting. The biggest problem in 2016, a big [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3580.5s)]
*  issue in the campaign was really radicalization. ISIS had to caliphate the size of Ohio [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3585.3799999999997s)]
*  and the whole talking point was we needed to defeat the territorial caliphate of ISIS, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3590.26s)]
*  and then we need to win the long term battle against extremism. There was a real fear that [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3594.34s)]
*  these extremists were basically using online mechanisms to radicalize people all over the world. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3599.0600000000004s)]
*  We needed to stop the flow of funds to terrorists. So they came with a proposal saying, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3604.0200000000004s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, the custodian of the two holy mosques, is going to lean into this and help you [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3607.94s)]
*  create a whole center where we're going to now single-handedly lead the fight with you to fight [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3613.38s)]
*  online extremism and radicalization. And by the way, they never called it modernizing Islam. He [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3617.7s)]
*  would always say, I want to restore Islam. He says, these people who are the terrorists, the ISIS, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3623.22s)]
*  they don't represent Islam. They are basically doing awful things in the name of Islam, and they [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3628.74s)]
*  are giving us Muslims a bad name, and we are just as aligned with you. Again, we don't think Trump [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3633.2999999999997s)]
*  is against Muslims. We think he's against Islamic extremists who pervert our religion. So they came [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  with this whole proposal, look, we're going to do hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3643.62s)]
*  the U.S. We're going to start paying for a lot more of our defense. And it was like a dream come [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3647.14s)]
*  true from everything that I thought Trump would like. They bring the proposal, again, me knowing [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3652.2599999999998s)]
*  absolutely nothing about Saudi Arabia, nothing about foreign policy. I bring it to the national [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3656.74s)]
*  security team and I say, well, this is a proposal we got from Saudi. Is this interesting? This is [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3660.98s)]
*  Jared. One of these things would be revolutionary. I said, well, they're saying they're going to do [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3666.2599999999998s)]
*  all of it if we kind of lean into the relationship. So then we go into the situation room to kind of [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3670.98s)]
*  assess, you know, what do we do with this? And I'm sitting with Secretary of Defense Mattis, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3675.3s)]
*  Tillerson, John Kelly, Homeland Security, and they're all saying, Saudi Arabia, and Tillerson's [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3679.6200000000003s)]
*  saying, I've dealt with the Saudis all my life. I ran Exxon Mobil. I know the Saudis. They never [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3684.1000000000004s)]
*  keep their word. They never come through. You know, Jared, it's a nice thing, but you're a young, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3688.34s)]
*  naive guy, and, you know, it's not going to go anywhere. I said, look, they're putting it all [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3692.5800000000004s)]
*  in writing. I said, why should we predetermine them to a future where nothing happens if they're [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3697.1400000000003s)]
*  saying they want to make these changes? Let's give them a little bit of rope. So we take it to the [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3701.46s)]
*  president, and he's doing a call with King Salman. And before the call, we're having this debate. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3705.62s)]
*  They say, you know, you're going to deal with King Salman. We deal with his brother, Mohammed bin [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3710.1800000000003s)]
*  Naif, who's the intelligence chief, and he's a great ally for the U.S. And I said, well, if he's [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3715.3s)]
*  such a good ally to the U.S., why do we have all these terrorist concerns with Saudi that you guys [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3721.2200000000003s)]
*  keep complaining about? And I said, look, I just want you to know I have a proposal from another [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3724.7400000000002s)]
*  guy there who's the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and he's saying he wants to do all [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3728.74s)]
*  these things to really change the big things that will really make a difference. So the call gets [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3732.8999999999996s)]
*  on the line. President Trump takes the call, speaks to King Salman. It was a pretty rough call because [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3737.7s)]
*  Trump, as you know, can be very blunt. And he basically says, we want to see changes and we want [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3741.06s)]
*  to see them fast. And what King Salman basically says to him is we're ready to lean in. We want to [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3745.7799999999997s)]
*  really strengthen the relationship with America. We did not like how it went before, and we're ready [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3750.18s)]
*  to do it. And so President Trump says, who should my team deal with? And he says, deal with my son, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3754.5s)]
*  the deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. So then he says, let him deal with Jared. And the reason [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3759.78s)]
*  why he chose me for us, he knew the other guys weren't believers and they'd probably sabotage. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3763.94s)]
*  So I get back to my desk and I have a note from him. We worked basically for like 90 days straight [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3768.26s)]
*  to set up this trip. He sent his top guys to Washington. I got every single thing in writing. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3774.58s)]
*  I couldn't get people in the White House to come to the meetings to plan the trip because they [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3778.82s)]
*  basically said, this is going to be a disaster. We are all going to be embarrassed and we want [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3781.62s)]
*  Jared to take the blame. We're taking off for the trip. I'm thinking to myself, why do I always do [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3785.7s)]
*  this to myself? We could have just gone to Mexico and cut a ribbon. What do I have to do this for? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3790.3399999999997s)]
*  So we go there. And I actually would encourage you to read or watch President Trump's speech from [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3795.2999999999997s)]
*  Riyadh because he basically said, excuse my French, he says, look, I'm not going there to kiss ass. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3799.8599999999997s)]
*  He says, I'm going there to kind of lay down markers and say, this is what needs to change and [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3804.18s)]
*  this is what we need to do. He went there with a very tough, realistic speech. And he basically [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3809.46s)]
*  said, this is not your problem. This is not our problem. This is all of our problems. We want to [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3814.7400000000002s)]
*  get these terrorists out of our homes, get them out of our mosques. Let's get them out of this world. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3818.82s)]
*  And it was very, very rough. And the King of Saudi Arabia gets up there and says, there is no glory [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3822.98s)]
*  in death, which also was a big statement. So I'm giving a long lead up to say this is where we are. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3827.06s)]
*  Over that visit, I had dinner with the Crown Prince, then the Deputy Crown Prince. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3834.7400000000002s)]
*  And I remember he said something to me, which was amazing, which he said, you know, my father's [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3838.34s)]
*  generation, they were kind of in the desert. You know, they really didn't have a lot. And they look [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3842.26s)]
*  at the city of Riyadh today with airports and military, and they got so much further than they [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3845.94s)]
*  ever dreamed they could. He says, my generation, we look at all of the potential that our country [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3850.82s)]
*  has that's not being sought after. And we see it as a big wasted opportunity. We want to go to much, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3856.1000000000004s)]
*  much higher heights. We believe in Saudi. I always say there's a reason why Saudi is such a [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3863.0600000000004s)]
*  big territory. They were amazing warriors back in the day. So it's an incredible people that have [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3868.02s)]
*  been very repressed through bad leadership for a long time. So again, people were very surprised, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3872.74s)]
*  the first reform, the second reform. And keep in mind, you have the religious police. People [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3878.2599999999998s)]
*  thought if he tried this stuff, they would kill him. And he was able to kind of move so quickly on [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3881.94s)]
*  so many reforms that he's freed that next generation. When we did our conference in Bahrain in 2019, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3886.58s)]
*  one of the challenges we had was finding role models for young Middle Eastern kids, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3891.94s)]
*  young Palestinian kids, say who are the new tech entrepreneurs? Who's the Mark Zuckerberg or the [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3898.02s)]
*  Elon Musk that these kids should look up to? Now I was in Saudi Arabia probably five months ago. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3901.7000000000003s)]
*  I had a meeting with like 30 tech entrepreneurs, and this guy's building the X of Saudi, the Y of [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3906.82s)]
*  Saudi. They're building all these great startups. And it's just he's unleashed a whole new generation [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3912.18s)]
*  of that. He once said to me as well, something which was amazing, where he said, because I was [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3916.02s)]
*  saying to him, you've got all these ambitious projects. I said, are you sure it's a good thing [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3920.74s)]
*  to be doing all this? Again, we're friends and we're able to have honest discussions with each [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3924.02s)]
*  other. We've had some tough discussions. We've had some fun discussions. But he basically looked [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3928.1s)]
*  at me and he said, Jared, he said, look, the way I view this is we have a country with amazing [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3933.2999999999997s)]
*  potential. As a leader, most leaders will say, let me do two or three things. And then you set [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3937.22s)]
*  low expectations and you achieve it and you declare success. He says, that's not my approach. He says, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3942.5s)]
*  my approach is I want to take on 100 things. And if I fail at 50 things, instead of looking back in [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3947.78s)]
*  five years and saying, I accomplished three things, I'll say, I accomplished 50 things. And so I think [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3952.9s)]
*  he's going for it in that way. So if you want to look at the significance of him, and I'll say this, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3958.1800000000003s)]
*  the Khashoggi thing was an absolutely terrible situation. But I think the American media got [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3963.3s)]
*  very fixated on it. And it's funny, I had a journalist, somebody who's an editor of a [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3968.02s)]
*  magazine calls me because she was moderating a panel with some Saudi ministers and said, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3972.82s)]
*  can you give me some advice on what I should ask about? I said, well, let's go away from the [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3977.06s)]
*  conventional stuff. Why don't you talk about what it's like to run a KPI driven government? I said, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3980.18s)]
*  that would be a very interesting conversation. It was a business conference. A performance indicator. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3986.42s)]
*  Yeah. So she said, I said, look, you know, you should go there and see what's happening. It is [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3989.54s)]
*  one of the most exciting places now in the world. And she says, oh, I can't go there. My colleagues [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3994.98s)]
*  will kill me. And as I'm saying to myself, well, that's not curiosity in journalism. So one of the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=3999.22s)]
*  biggest misperceptions I believe right now in America is the American journalists are not [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4003.62s)]
*  paying attention to what's happening there. And it's one of the most exciting transformations in [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4007.62s)]
*  the world. And if you think about why I am a believer that in Gaza or in the West Bank, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4012.02s)]
*  there's hope to transform those societies and take the people who right now people say, oh, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4016.66s)]
*  they're all radicalized. You know, how can we transform them? Look what's happened in Saudi [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4020.66s)]
*  Arabia over five years. So if you think about him in the context of kind of like the 21st century [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4025.14s)]
*  and how we'll look at it, I think that I put half of it in the context of the amount of extremism [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4033.1400000000003s)]
*  and radicalization that we are not having to deal with because of the way that he's taken Saudi [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4038.98s)]
*  Arabia in a different direction. I think that's a it's funny in politics, you know, again, I look [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4044.1000000000004s)]
*  at some of the things talking about saying, oh, well, you know, we're going in and we're solving [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4048.7400000000002s)]
*  a problem. We're going and solving the border crisis that we basically created, right? Here, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4051.6200000000003s)]
*  he's spending a lot of time and effort and risk to have avoided what I think are massive, potentially [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4056.26s)]
*  unovercomeable problems. The other side of it is the contributions, right? And so there we're kind [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4062.18s)]
*  of in the middle phase. I think he's already accomplished, to be honest with you, from when I [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4067.14s)]
*  met him the first time and he told me about a lot of these dreams, I think he's accomplished [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4071.8599999999997s)]
*  way more than I think anyone could have expected. And I think the cool thing is, is he's just getting [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4076.4199999999996s)]
*  warmed up. And so then you think about these projects, he's a very out of the box thinker. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4081.22s)]
*  I see that he's getting better and better. The ministers around him, again, they all sit around. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4086.3399999999997s)]
*  It's like sitting with the leadership team of a startup. They're getting better and better. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4091.46s)]
*  They're competitive with each other, but in a friendly way. And I think that there's a real [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4096.74s)]
*  ambition and an appetite for risk there that you don't see in a lot of countries. And they have the [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4100.58s)]
*  resources. And you think about the location, right? They have access to, in the Gulf right now, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4105.54s)]
*  and the reason I'm so bullish there is you have access to the European market and to the US market, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4110.02s)]
*  but then you have access to the Asian market where there's massive, massive growth. So you look at [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4114.82s)]
*  the circumference around them, you have like four billion people. You've got a lot, you've [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4118.34s)]
*  established markets, emerging markets. They have a, you know, net surpluses because of their oil [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4121.9400000000005s)]
*  trade. They're making massive investments in renewables. They're being a true leader in a [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4127.06s)]
*  lot of fronts. And I think that's very exciting. So again, I was very, without him, I don't think [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4131.7s)]
*  we would have been able to turn the tide in the region. I'm still very optimistic. I think now, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4138.34s)]
*  it's funny, they're talking about with Israel, it's not a question of if, it's a question of, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4143.3s)]
*  of when and how and for what, right? And so those negotiations are ongoing. I think they could be, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4147.22s)]
*  they could, they could conclude in a week from now, they could conclude in a year from now, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4152.820000000001s)]
*  but they're going to happen. And that's all because of the effort that he's bringing. And I think that [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4156.18s)]
*  you're going to see a different Middle East, a different, a different world because of the [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4160.26s)]
*  work he's done. So I think it's very exciting. You're definitely clearly bullish on, on MBS and [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4164.580000000001s)]
*  on Saudi. Are you so bullish on them that you'd invest there? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Look, one of the [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4170.900000000001s)]
*  challenges of investing there is that they're doing so much investment internally. I've looked [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4176.66s)]
*  at several things. You know, we made one great investment in UAE in an online classifieds business, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4181.62s)]
*  which is basically correlated to the growth in real estate. But UAE in this last conflict really [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4185.7s)]
*  said, we want to take the role of Switzerland. And so they basically said, we're not getting involved. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4190.0199999999995s)]
*  We've been in the middle of too many things. And so they've had an explosion in their market. And [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4193.54s)]
*  that's been a massively successful investment for us. That business is going into Saudi as well. And [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4197.38s)]
*  we have another couple of businesses we're looking in Saudi and I definitely would invest in the [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4201.78s)]
*  right way. And you have to get comfortable. It's, it's like every market has its insiders and its [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4206.5s)]
*  local customs. So we've gone slowly, but I am very bullish there. All right. So when we started here, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4210.179999999999s)]
*  I told you, you should never count on a middle-aged Egyptian man to keep time, particularly when [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4215.139999999999s)]
*  you're talking to somebody as interesting as Jared Kushner. So can we take like maybe two questions? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4219.78s)]
*  Is that cool? So I want to call on students in my class, IJ 655. And the first person I have is [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4224.099999999999s)]
*  Zantana Efram. So who's right over here. Yep. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4230.66s)]
*  Hi, Jared. Thank you for being here with us today. So the question I'd submitted to Professor Masood [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4240.820000000001s)]
*  is this, as you're undoubtedly aware, there have been numerous significant discussions across the [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4245.46s)]
*  country surrounding the campus culture and higher education, particularly in relation to the Israeli [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4250.02s)]
*  Palestinian conflict. These conversations often touch upon anti-Palestinian sentiments, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4254.66s)]
*  Islamophobia and antisemitism. I assume your presence here today suggests that you recognize [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4259.46s)]
*  the necessity of what the Harvard Kennedy School calls candid conversations, particularly within [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4264.5s)]
*  institutions of higher education. In light of this, could you share your perspective on areas [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4270.18s)]
*  where you believe Harvard University, its donors or students may have faltered or faced missteps [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4274.42s)]
*  in addressing the complexities of the conflict on our campus? Sure. So I'll be honest. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4279.3s)]
*  When I got reached out to you from Tarek, it was at a time where a lot of my friends were getting [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4287.780000000001s)]
*  very, very negative on Harvard. And I've always been somebody, I'm not big into condemnation, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4292.42s)]
*  I'm big in engagement. Every now and then you got to do condemnation. But they say like, you know, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4298.42s)]
*  you don't make peace with your friends, you have to kind of like go out there and go into places [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4302.820000000001s)]
*  that are uncomfortable. I will say that, and by the way, I'll say one other pretext, which is, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4306.5s)]
*  I got here about an hour before this and I was walking around campus and [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4311.78s)]
*  you guys are all so lucky to be here. This place is absolutely amazing. It is so special. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4315.78s)]
*  It's survived for a long time and it's always been a beacon of excellence. And like all great [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4321.38s)]
*  institutions, perhaps maybe it lost its way a little bit. I'm sure that's happened in the past. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4327.3s)]
*  I have not studied the history of Harvard as much as I have some of these other topics. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4331.7s)]
*  But much harder. The history of Harvard. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4335.78s)]
*  Yeah. But what I would say is this, is that I'm more interested in kind of tomorrow in the future. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4339.219999999999s)]
*  Right? I think that what we've been through has been a very interesting time for the country. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4344.74s)]
*  I think it's been an interesting time in the world. I think there's been a lot of emotions. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4349.46s)]
*  I think I would just encourage people, no matter what your persuasion is, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4353.46s)]
*  to figure out how to engage. Right? I think that I saw this when I was in New York before I went [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4356.9s)]
*  into the political world. I only had like one friend who was a Republican. I remember sitting [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4362.02s)]
*  here at Harvard and the things that we would say about George Bush and how certain and how [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4365.780000000001s)]
*  arrogant we were about his policies. And by the way, I'm not a fan of him as a president. I don't [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4369.620000000001s)]
*  think he was a good president. But it was such a self-righteousness about the thought that now I [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4373.3s)]
*  look back and reflection and I see. I saw the same thing in New York where the echo chamber I was in, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4380.9800000000005s)]
*  which I thought was like a very worldly echo chamber. I was with the heads of the banks, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4385.620000000001s)]
*  the heads of the hedge funds, the heads of the fashion companies, the heads of the technology [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4388.98s)]
*  companies. We'd be at our house. We'd have artists over. And I thought I'd have journalists. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4391.78s)]
*  I thought I was just with this very eclectic, worldly, diverse group. It turned out I was [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4396.5s)]
*  just in a massive echo chamber. And what I would say for all of you is I would say try to pursue [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4402.259999999999s)]
*  independent thought. When people are screaming, I'm not sure that that's necessarily the most [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4407.78s)]
*  productive way. I would try to do your research. I would try to be with people on both sides. And [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4414.74s)]
*  I would try to engage. This place has a very special history. It has a lot of that special to [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4418.26s)]
*  it. And I think that if each of you say, how can we try to contribute to make this a comfortable [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4424.5s)]
*  place for everyone, let's learn. Let's continue to grow and evolve. I think that it's possible [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4429.14s)]
*  that this place can hopefully come back to where it has the potential to be. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4433.7s)]
*  Right. Okay. We'll take one more. I have Barack Sela over here. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4436.9800000000005s)]
*  Hi, my name is Barack Sela. I'm a student in Tarek's class. So let's pretend that in a year [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4448.26s)]
*  from now you are Secretary of State. And looking at sort of the situation of foreign policy in the [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4461.7s)]
*  U.S., a lot of dissatisfaction on the right and the left. And post October 7th, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4469.94s)]
*  knowing that we can't go back, you're always talking about going forward. How should America's [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4478.099999999999s)]
*  foreign policy in the Middle East change regarding the challenges that are now facing the Middle East, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4482.179999999999s)]
*  Israel, the Arab world after October 7th? What has changed? How has it changed fundamentally [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4488.98s)]
*  how the United States needs to approach its foreign policy? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4493.94s)]
*  So first of all, I'm just going to say all this is as a hypothetical, right, which is always [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4496.74s)]
*  dangerous to do. But what I would say is that if you go back for, I think, you know, look, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4501.46s)]
*  when President Clinton left office, you know, America was an N of 1 superpower in the world, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4507.06s)]
*  and it was mostly peaceful. You think about through both the Bush and Obama administrations, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4510.74s)]
*  I think the foreign policy of both administrations did not achieve great results and made the world [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4517.14s)]
*  a lot less safe, allowed China to rise, you know, got us into war in Iraq, war in Afghanistan, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4522.74s)]
*  led to a big instability in the region, which, again, when President Trump got in in 2017, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4528.74s)]
*  we had to deal with like literally a decade and a half of massive mismanagement. Again, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4534.259999999999s)]
*  I think we spent the whole time trying to fix a lot of problems that we inherited, and I think [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4538.9s)]
*  at the end we left it with a lot of good momentum. How do you go back to where we had it and then [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4543.139999999999s)]
*  build upon it in that regard? I think there's kind of a couple things, and I wish everything [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4548.34s)]
*  was like black and white, but I found in foreign policy, like in most things in life, there's [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4553.14s)]
*  always like a thousand shades of gray, and you need to figure out how everything connects to [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4557.3s)]
*  everything else. So number one is that you need to impose a penalty on Iran, and you need them to [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4562.02s)]
*  feel like there is a risk to keep the trouble they are making, right? So what President Trump [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4567.54s)]
*  used to say about Iran is that they've never won a war, but they've never lost a negotiation. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4573.38s)]
*  So they're always going around feeling, trying. In 2017, in 2016, Iran, after the JCPOA, when [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4577.46s)]
*  Obama left office, was selling about 2.7 million barrels a day of oil. By the end of the Trump [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4587.7s)]
*  administration, they were selling 100,000 barrels of oil a day on the illicit market. So basically, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4592.26s)]
*  we totally dissected their economy. They were out of foreign currency reserves, and they were [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4597.54s)]
*  dead broke. I mean, they're pretty good with ballistic missiles, but they're air forces from [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4603.14s)]
*  like the 1970s. So they had no capabilities. Wars are expensive. They had no capabilities [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4606.5s)]
*  to withstand war, and we had the world pretty united in enforcing the sanctions against them. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4611.700000000001s)]
*  It was a very tough battle with Europe and with China and with Russia and a lot of others, but we [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4616.34s)]
*  were able to create enough issues that were else we were able to really kind of put them in a box [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4620.5s)]
*  and make them fear us. So I would say number one is you have to focus on Iran, and they have to [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4624.5s)]
*  first of all, start cramping down on their resources. And number two, you need to create [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4629.06s)]
*  some kind of fear that this behavior is not going to be treated lightly. I also think there's an [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4633.14s)]
*  issue where you need to figure out how to reset the relationship with China, and I think you need [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4640.74s)]
*  to figure out an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. I don't think there's much there that's happening. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4644.02s)]
*  I think that Russia wants to see us now more distracted, so I do think that they're [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4650.58s)]
*  incentivized to be against whatever position the U.S. is in in the Middle East. So let's say the [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4655.22s)]
*  U.S. came out tomorrow and said we're against Israel, Russia would then go back to Israel. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4660.18s)]
*  I think that there's a dynamic there where they want to see us distracted so that we focus less [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4663.3s)]
*  on them, and so I think that that conflict strategically is not good for us. I think you [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4668.1s)]
*  need a resolution there. So I think number one is contain Iran. Number two is we took a little bit [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4672.1s)]
*  of a different approach than the administrations before us and after us with Hamas. So if you go [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4677.54s)]
*  back with Hamas, they had the same business plan from basically 2006 up until like 2017. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4682.82s)]
*  They would fire rockets into Israel. Israel would overreact. The world would then reflexively [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4689.46s)]
*  condemn Israel because every one of their military targets is underneath a school or a residential [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4694.5s)]
*  area. Israel sends out leaflets saying please, civilians move, we're about to bomb, which [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4699.139999999999s)]
*  really eliminates the element of surprise. But they basically would fire rockets into [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4705.0599999999995s)]
*  Israel. Israel would overreact. The world would condemn Israel. Then there'd be a conference. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4712.5s)]
*  They'd raise money. Hamas would get cash. They'd be good for a couple years. They'd run out of money. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4716.34s)]
*  They'd say what should we do? So I've got an idea. Let's fire rocks into Israel. Israel will overreact. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4720.34s)]
*  The world will condemn Israel. The hold a conference. We'll get some more money. We'll [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4725.86s)]
*  be good for a couple years. When Hamas did that the first time with us, what the State Department [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4728.66s)]
*  was saying is we urge both sides to show restraint. We basically did something different. We said [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4734.18s)]
*  Israel is the right to defend itself. We support that. Israel went in, bombed the crowd. We said [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4739.7s)]
*  no more money. We're not putting more money in until they stop bombing. We're not putting good [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4743.54s)]
*  money after bad. If you guys actually show us a paradigm, the thing with Gaza that was different [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4747.22s)]
*  from the West Bank is there's no religious sites. There's no border disputes and there's no [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4751.62s)]
*  religious sites. It was kind of like a very simple concept of you guys stop being terrorists and [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4756.34s)]
*  we'll figure out how to rebuild the place. So the notion there was show them that there's going to [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4761.38s)]
*  be a real, they're not going to be rewarded for their bad actions. Like now giving them a [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4767.62s)]
*  Palestinian state is basically a reinforcement of we are going to reward you for bad actions, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4772.0199999999995s)]
*  right? Which giving Hamas a Palestinian state, you're giving Palestinians a Palestinian state. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4777.22s)]
*  What do you think that will do for the popularity of Hamas and for people? If you're a young person [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4780.82s)]
*  and you have two people trying to influence you and you have Mohammed Abbas saying my way of [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4786.82s)]
*  being peaceful has what brought us a state. By the way, they all think he's corrupt. They don't like [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4791.7s)]
*  when you criticize their government. But he says my way of being peaceful, or you have Hamas saying [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4795.54s)]
*  the only way we ever got anything was by going in and killing and raping and murdering and we [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4800.0199999999995s)]
*  showed them that we can be tough and they feared us and the world rewarded us for it. So my sense [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4804.58s)]
*  is it's an unbelievably awful precedent to do. You have to show terrorists that they will not be [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4808.9s)]
*  tolerated and that we will take strong action. So number one, you've got to put some cramps on Iran. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4813.62s)]
*  Number two, you have to be very tough at going after the terrorists. Number three, you have to [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4820.1s)]
*  work with everyone. There was a lot of trust eroded in the region since we left. UAE was shot [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4823.62s)]
*  from the Houthis. By the way, it doesn't matter. But bottom line is then I would focus on how do [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4830.9s)]
*  you get the deal with Saudi done? And those talks continue to evolve. I did an interview with Lex [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4838.099999999999s)]
*  Friedman basically two days after and he asked me is the Saudi deal dead with Israel? I said no, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4841.94s)]
*  the industrial logic is still strong there. It's just now Israel's going to have to do what they're [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4848.18s)]
*  going to do and then when it's done it's in the interest of all sides. So Israel still wants that [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4852.74s)]
*  deal. The Biden administration still wants that deal and Saudi still wants that deal. So that deal [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4856.66s)]
*  is still very much alive and it's interesting to the dynamics. You know the Biden guys initially [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4861.54s)]
*  said they're going to make Saudi a pariah and now they're basically running over there begging them [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4864.74s)]
*  for help to try to figure out how to kind of get this resolved. So the long answer is I think that's [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4868.58s)]
*  really how you have to do it. You have to stand with Israel. I think it's very, very important. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4873.38s)]
*  We deterred a lot of threats because we stood with Israel. I think the North right now [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4876.9s)]
*  is combustible. I am nervous. I think the U.S. did the right move sending the carriers over initially [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4883.299999999999s)]
*  but it just takes a lot of dry leaves. It just takes a little spark and that thing can conflate. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4889.7s)]
*  There it's a pretty tough situation. You need a long-term plan to try to diffuse that situation [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4899.379999999999s)]
*  but you have to figure out how to hope. But it's about being strong, being strong with Israel, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4906.66s)]
*  containing Iran, showing the terrorists they're not going to be rewarded for their actions [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4911.54s)]
*  and working closely with your partners in Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf to try to figure out how to [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4916.18s)]
*  continue the economic project that we started. But Jared you've got to agree with me and then [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4921.38s)]
*  we'll have to end. You've got to agree with me that ultimately at the end of the day [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4925.46s)]
*  the real deal with Arabs that matters for Israel is with Palestinians. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4929.62s)]
*  I'll just say this as [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4934.5s)]
*  I think that for Israel and actually for the Jewish people having a proper resolution to that [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4942.02s)]
*  is very important. Because I do think that that's been an excuse for a lot of global anti-Semitism [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4948.1s)]
*  to hide behind this conflict. I think that that's been, so I think it's definitely within the [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4954.18s)]
*  interests of Israel and the Jewish people to find a resolution to the issue. But, and this is the [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4960.66s)]
*  most important but, it has to be a solution that's sustainable. And when you ask me what's my biggest [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4968.82s)]
*  fear, my biggest fear is that you have a lot of people who are chasing a deal for the sake of a [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4976.26s)]
*  deal and not looking to make a deal that will really leave this in a position where it allows, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4981.38s)]
*  it makes future conflict less likely. And the way you do that is by creating a paradigm where you [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4988.1s)]
*  don't reward bad behavior. You need the right institutions to allow the Palestinian people [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4993.46s)]
*  to live a better life. You know you said something to me when we were talking. I don't know if I'm [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=4998.660000000001s)]
*  allowed to say this or I could just say I heard this from a friend. And I actually thought it [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5001.780000000001s)]
*  was really smart. It had me thinking and it's absolutely true. You know that Oslo has been a [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5006.5s)]
*  total failure. And again we've all worked in the constructs of that. But if you think about it, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5010.900000000001s)]
*  you know for all these years in the Middle East, again before you had all these countries and all [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5016.82s)]
*  these arbitrary lines that we spoke about with Sykes-Picot, you basically had a situation where [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5020.099999999999s)]
*  you had the tribal system. And still there's still form of governance in the different cities and [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5024.5s)]
*  towns in the tribal system. Oslo, I went before about how Arafat was in Jordan. He tried to [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5028.0199999999995s)]
*  assassinate the king. They basically, you know, they had Black Saturday, Black September. They [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5032.66s)]
*  got these guys out. They went up to Lebanon. They called on Lebanon. They kicked them out of Lebanon. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5037.38s)]
*  They went to your favorite place, Tunisia. They're in Tunisia sitting in villas on the beach, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5042.42s)]
*  basically broke and there. And then the U.S. and Israel have this great idea of saying we're [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5046.9800000000005s)]
*  going to take this former terrorist who's sitting in a villa in Tunisia and we're going to put him [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5051.62s)]
*  in charge of the Palestinians. And then all of a sudden you've got this like tribal system that's [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5055.06s)]
*  been working there for a long time. They're like why the hell is this guy in charge of us? And then [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5059.54s)]
*  for 30 years we've had nothing but failure. The people's lives have not gotten better and that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5064.1s)]
*  hasn't worked. So again, my fear is that I'm seeing a lot of conventional thinking with the [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5069.38s)]
*  same people who have failed. Again, you go to a boss, he's like a broken record. He said the same [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5078.900000000001s)]
*  thing and his record of non-achieving is not good. And my fear is really for the people because I [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5084.900000000001s)]
*  think that they've been pawns in this situation. And the one thing I'll say strongly, you know, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5089.9400000000005s)]
*  are very good people who are pro- I always say this, there's like four categories in this conflict. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5094.74s)]
*  You have pro-Israel, that's acceptable. You have indifferent, that's acceptable. You have [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5099.86s)]
*  pro-Palestinian, that's acceptable. You have pro-Hamas, that is not acceptable. Right? You [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5103.78s)]
*  think about if you want to be pro-Palestinian, the best thing you can do is say the people who [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5108.42s)]
*  have been holding these people back is their leadership. When we held the conference in [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5114.9800000000005s)]
*  Bahrain, so I'll do this part very quickly then we'll wrap. We held the conference in Bahrain, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5118.1s)]
*  again, go to my piece of prosperity, Google it, you'll go through. I have a full business plan [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5122.82s)]
*  that I built. It's a hundred and I think eighty-three page document that goes through all the different [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5126.099999999999s)]
*  changes you need and every investment that we would make in order to build a functioning society. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5130.5s)]
*  We had every businessman from around the world, Steve Schwarzman came, Rayl Seymour from AT&T, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5135.86s)]
*  had all the leading Arab businessmen, and they all said we want to do things to make the lives [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5139.86s)]
*  of the Palestinian people better and we will invest there. But the reason we're not going to [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5143.78s)]
*  invest there, again, you can't have jobs and prosperity without investment, right? They still [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5148.099999999999s)]
*  teach capitalism at Harvard, I think. Secretly. Secretly, right? Capitalism is like a very [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5151.22s)]
*  powerful force towards improving people's lives and that's been proven time and time again. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5158.1s)]
*  What they all said is the reason we're not investing has nothing to do with Israel. It [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5165.14s)]
*  has to do with there's no rule of law. We don't want to go build a factory or a power plant and [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5168.18s)]
*  have it blown up by terrorism. There's no property rights. How are we going to go do something then [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5172.18s)]
*  it's expropriated by these thugs? What I would say is that without the proper Palestinian [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5176.82s)]
*  leadership, and again, you can't just say, oh, we're going to do a reinvigorate Palestinian [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5182.179999999999s)]
*  authority. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. You need a new idea that's actually going [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5186.42s)]
*  to work because if you're Israel, yes, I think, and a lot of Israelis at their core, they want [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5191.139999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians to live a better life. They want a Palestinians, the state right now, the state means [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5196.58s)]
*  a lot of things. It's a very controversial word, even though it shouldn't be because it means [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5201.38s)]
*  different things to different people. But the fundamental underlying part of it that's essential [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5204.98s)]
*  is, is there a governing structure in this area for the Palestinian people that will not threaten [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5211.379999999999s)]
*  Israel security wise and that will give the Palestinian people the opportunity to live a [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5217.0599999999995s)]
*  better life? Without those two things, nothing is acceptable. You can call it whatever the hell you [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5221.7s)]
*  want. Yeah. Yeah. And I think so. So I think this is a really important note to end on though, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5226.419999999999s)]
*  because I think anybody who leaves here would think, well, the tune that Jared Kushner really [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5230.9s)]
*  wants us to hum is that the number one most important thing that we've got to do is invest [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5235.78s)]
*  in the building of Palestinian institutions. And I don't know how you do that while, you know, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5240.58s)]
*  a big chunk of Palestine is under this massive bombing campaign. So what I would say this is [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5247.54s)]
*  like, that's one of the cool, I'll give you the last word. Okay, cool. Yeah. So one of the things [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5253.46s)]
*  I learned also in government is that, especially in the Middle East, the number one rule you should [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5257.38s)]
*  follow when doing it is that if they're not screaming at you, you're not on the right path. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5261.38s)]
*  Right? Because all the- I must always on the right path. Exactly. Yeah. So the conventional [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5264.82s)]
*  thinking in that region has just the track record of everyone who's going to be talking is just wrong. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5269.46s)]
*  Right? So think about it again, we go back to like, how do I look at it? First principles, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5274.58s)]
*  results oriented, results outcome, and how do you advance human prosperity? How do you [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5280.02s)]
*  advance human potential? How do you give people the chance to live safe, have better life? If [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5286.42s)]
*  it doesn't fit in those criteria, and you put patchwork on it, then you're doing what politicians [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5290.82s)]
*  do, which again, Trump, coming from the business world, myself come from the business world, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5295.62s)]
*  problems either solved or it's not. Right? You can't put a bandaid on something and call it [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5300.9s)]
*  solved because it's going to go bad. I think the psychology right now of Israel is very much, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5304.34s)]
*  we can never let this happen again. And so I think what they're doing is they're hoping that [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5308.66s)]
*  a solution will develop. And again, I think this is the burden now that the Biden administration [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5312.58s)]
*  carries. I think the Arab countries want to see this happen as well. But I do think there's a very [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5317.0599999999995s)]
*  big desire to come up with a solution that will make everyone more prosperous and more safe in [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5323.3s)]
*  the long term. And that's what it's about. Right? I have friends now who are Muslims, who are [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5329.22s)]
*  Christians, who are Jews. When I would go sit with people, they knew I was Jewish, I was an [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5332.74s)]
*  envoy from America. We're all the same people. We have the same blood in our brains. And when we [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5336.74s)]
*  recognize that, we all kind of want to make things better, whether you're Democrat, you're [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5341.7s)]
*  Republican, you know, Israeli, Palestinian. And if you kind of come in with that framing, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5347.139999999999s)]
*  then there's a lot of progress that you can make. But you can't do stupid things short term that [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5351.54s)]
*  you'll pay the price for long term. Okay. This is a good note to end on. First of all, I want to [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5357.22s)]
*  thank you, Jared, for coming to Harvard. I know it's your old stomping grounds, but one could be [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5361.46s)]
*  forgiven for thinking it's like going to enemy territory. Hopefully you feel that this was a [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5366.82s)]
*  welcoming environment. And we can get you to come back so we can argue some more with a bunch of [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5372.98s)]
*  things that you said that I still want to argue with, but we don't have time for. And I want to [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5377.299999999999s)]
*  thank all of you for coming and just being an exemplary Harvard audience. And so please join [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5381.62s)]
*  me in thanking Jared Kushner. Thank you. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaIHr5S0ts&t=5387.54s)]
