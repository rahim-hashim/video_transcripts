# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with H.E. Salam Fayyad
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE)
*  Welcome, everybody, to the fourth Middle East dialogue, which we are describing as a series [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=0.0s)]
*  of conversations with the vital and varied perspectives on the conflict in Gaza, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=10.88s)]
*  United States' role in it, and the broader challenges and opportunities facing the Middle [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=16.44s)]
*  East as a whole. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=21.72s)]
*  There's probably no more vital perspective than that of our guest today, Dr. Salem Fayyad, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=23.38s)]
*  who served as the prime minister of the Palestinian National Authority from 2007 to 2013. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=32.34s)]
*  In 2009, the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman coined the term Fayyadism to refer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  to Dr. Fayyad's belief that, quote, an Arab leader's legitimacy should be based not on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=49.5s)]
*  slogans or rejectionism or personality cults or security services, but on delivering transparent, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=55.46s)]
*  accountable administration and services. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=63.1s)]
*  Whenever anybody asks me what my religion is, I say Fayyadism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  He is currently a visiting professor at- [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=71.82s)]
*  So you are fasting today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=74.14s)]
*  I think we've been fasting since 2013. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=81.18s)]
*  Dr. Fayyad is currently a visiting professor at Princeton, and he is a senior fellow here [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=85.86s)]
*  at the Middle East Initiative. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=91.7s)]
*  And throughout this series, a lot of people have criticized me at various times for platforming [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=93.42s)]
*  this person or that person. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=101.22s)]
*  And I always respond by saying, look, I'm not trying to platform anybody. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to have conversations and expose views. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=107.18s)]
*  But in this case, I'm totally platforming. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  Now, Dr. Fayyad does not need Tariq Massoud to platform him, but nonetheless, it's my [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  great pleasure to do so, to bring his views to our audience. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=121.62s)]
*  It's long been my belief that the world would be immeasurably better if we just listened [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=127.42s)]
*  to everything he said about everything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=131.18s)]
*  I'm just saying this at the outset to be totally transparent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=133.54s)]
*  I don't think I've ever disagreed with something Saddam Fayyad said. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  Or rather, when I've disagreed with it, I very quickly changed my view to conform to it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  So Dr. Fayyad and I are going to talk for 45 minutes, maybe an hour, and then we'll [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  have 30 minutes for questions from the audience. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  We'll start with my students, but then open it up to everybody. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=155.54s)]
*  Before we get started, I do want to note for everybody that the event is being recorded [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=159.5s)]
*  and will be released on the internet, in this case, fortunately. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=165.1s)]
*  And so when you ask a question, your voice and visage will be recorded for all time and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=171.18s)]
*  eternity and beamed throughout the known universe. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=177.5s)]
*  So if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you shouldn't ask a question, but hopefully [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=180.86s)]
*  you will be comfortable with that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=185.94s)]
*  The other thing I've been asked to do is read some text about possible disturbances, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=187.54s)]
*  but that's not going to happen, so I won't need to read the text. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=192.5s)]
*  Before we get started, please join me in welcoming Dr. Salam Fayyad. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=195.98s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Salam. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=207.5s)]
*  So I wanted to start by talking about Gaza and the military campaign there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  It began as a response to the terrorist attacks of October 7th, but now the response has cost [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=215.5s)]
*  more than 30,000 lives, and it's brought such untold human suffering that even friends of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=222.18s)]
*  Israel are now entertaining the notion that what Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=227.94s)]
*  allies are doing could be described as genocidal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=233.66s)]
*  You're in touch with people in Gaza on the ground. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=238.7s)]
*  Can you describe the situation there for us? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=241.26s)]
*  First of all, thank you very much, Professor Masoud, for hosting me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=244.74s)]
*  Speaking of platforming, any platform is high for me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=248.14s)]
*  There is no higher platform. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=254.42s)]
*  I'm honored to be with you, and thank you, the Canadian School, Police Initiative, and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  the audience for their interest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=261.62s)]
*  Yeah, sure, I'm in touch with people in Gaza from the very beginning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=263.94s)]
*  I always was, have been, certainly after October 7th. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=266.86s)]
*  And maybe a month and a half, maybe two months into this, just about anyone I talked to in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=272.42s)]
*  Gaza either had lost someone to death or injury or knew someone who had lost someone to death [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=281.18s)]
*  or injury. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=289.82s)]
*  A recently released poll, actually three, four days ago, the most recent poll issued [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=290.82s)]
*  by Center for Policy Research and Analysis, Chicago's poll, found that 80% of the respondents [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=297.26s)]
*  from Gaza, 80% said that they had lost a member or more of their family to death or injury. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=305.14s)]
*  So this begins to tell you the story of how massive the scale of death and injury has [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=314.86s)]
*  been, not to mention other aspects of misery when livelihood became virtually impossible [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=323.38s)]
*  and continues to be, including famine and images that a lot of you have seen actually [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=331.1s)]
*  on television of people cooking during month of Ramadan grass to eat. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=337.98s)]
*  So for all the talk about humanitarian assistance and delivery thereof and the effort made and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=346.06s)]
*  calls made to expand the scope of humanitarian relief that continues to be guessed as we [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=352.22s)]
*  speak. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=358.94000000000005s)]
*  Especially early on, the massive bombing bombardment aerial from the sea everywhere and seeing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=359.94000000000005s)]
*  people in the tents die and all. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=369.42s)]
*  Images, you know, we never really can move away from the images of the death and destruction. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=373.66s)]
*  Little kids, some you see, one in particular really stands out, her name is Doreen, talking [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=381.02s)]
*  about her family members, counting them one by one by one by one. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=389.98s)]
*  She herself was injured, just about the only member of family left alive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=393.82s)]
*  So this is how bad it is, to be honest with you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=400.1s)]
*  Certainly and most immediately, our people in Gaza are suffering the most. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=402.98s)]
*  But for the rest of us, myself included, it's that deep sense of helplessness, maybe even [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=409.14s)]
*  deep sense of guilt about not being there to die with them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=416.78s)]
*  Really, this is how deep and personal this is for all of us. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=421.06s)]
*  And it's the kind of thing that I'm sure will stay with us for many, many generations to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=424.9s)]
*  come. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=429.62s)]
*  So for the reporting, people focus on numbers, 32,000 killed, more than 70,000, 80,000 people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  injured, many unaccounted for. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=439.1s)]
*  And sometimes the numbers keep on being repeated to the point where people become desensitized [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=442.94s)]
*  to these stories as numbers. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  But the horror of it is massive. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=451.5s)]
*  We know how this whole thing started, described as a war of response, but it truly did not [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  take too long before it began to be seen as and felt as war of aggression. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=460.38s)]
*  And the victims are obviously, by and large, for the most part, civilians who have nothing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=467.94s)]
*  to do with anything, and many of whom are women and children, elderly. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=472.9s)]
*  So that's kind of a sketch of what comes to mind as you ask the question. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=477.5s)]
*  No, I appreciate that because I think it's important for us to just keep in view that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=483.62s)]
*  when we are talking about the politics of this problem and how to solve it, that ultimately [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  at the end of the day, we are talking about a situation in which there is quite massive [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=493.02s)]
*  human suffering ongoing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=497.26s)]
*  I wanted to get you to reflect a little bit on Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  So a few weeks ago, six weeks ago, I hosted Jared Kushner here. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=504.14s)]
*  And when I asked him about fears that Netanyahu might be trying to push Palestinians out of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=509.42s)]
*  Gaza, he downplayed those fears. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=513.62s)]
*  But he also said that Gaza was a construct. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=516.3s)]
*  He said that it didn't have a historical precedent, that it became a thing only after the 1948 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=519.48s)]
*  war. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=526.38s)]
*  And I didn't really push on that line of inquiry. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=527.38s)]
*  But can you describe what Gaza really is and what it means to Palestinians? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=531.62s)]
*  Well, Gaza has always been an integral part of who we are. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=537.0999999999999s)]
*  And certainly, even more so, after the peace process began. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  But historically, I mean, it's obvious that it's an integral part of who we are, both [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=548.2199999999999s)]
*  in terms of geography and people, maybe not always politically, as everybody knows. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=553.34s)]
*  For the period between 1948 and 1967, it was under a different administration as contrasted [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=559.9s)]
*  with Jordan, with the West Bank, which was a part of Hashemite King Jordan for that 19th [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=565.9s)]
*  year period. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=572.9s)]
*  But after Oslo, with the promise it brought to Palestinians, I say promise, maybe expectation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=574.1s)]
*  of statehood, it being noted that that was not really formally enshrined or even, some [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=581.26s)]
*  would say, I would say, even implied in Oslo. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=588.38s)]
*  It became the expectation that the state of Palestine will actually be on the territory [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=592.78s)]
*  Israel occupied in 1967 in its entirety, including Gaza. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=598.58s)]
*  Now, Gaza historically was the place where many, I mean, the Palestinian National Movement, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=603.1s)]
*  actually going back to the 50s of the last century, was home to that, for sure. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=612.94s)]
*  The first Intifada in December 1987 actually erupted in Gaza. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=618.66s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=625.02s)]
*  I cannot really conceive for a minute, perceive a possibility, however remote, where there [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  ever being a Palestinian state, if we're talking about a Palestinian state on the territory [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=632.66s)]
*  Israel occupied in 1967, if Gaza is not an integral part of that institution, that state, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=637.06s)]
*  it's impossible as a matter of fact. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=645.6999999999999s)]
*  Looking at it from Israel's point of view in two ways. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  One, for those who for a long time wanted to see in their own words separation ahead [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=652.62s)]
*  of statehood, if that were to happen, Gaza was an important part of their presentation [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=659.86s)]
*  because their argument was made on the basis of demography, the saying that we cannot be [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=664.74s)]
*  both democratic and Jewish at the same time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  What they were really talking about is basically sheer numbers. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=674.38s)]
*  And if you were to take Gaza outside demographic mix, that would make, at the time the conversation [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=677.94s)]
*  was taking place in the 90s, that intersection far removed into the future, for sure. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=684.14s)]
*  So anybody who really wanted to see a Palestinian state, that in the first instance had to respond [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=690.1s)]
*  to the aspirations of Palestinian people, but to the Israelis who also saw benefit to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=696.66s)]
*  them in something like that happening, the idea that Gaza was going to be outside the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=701.78s)]
*  mix was something that was not conceivable. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=707.66s)]
*  However, for those who were opposed to the idea of Palestinian statehood, separating [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=711.06s)]
*  Gaza from the entirety of Palestinian polity was absolutely important because if you did [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=717.02s)]
*  that you do exactly the opposite of what I have just said. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=721.38s)]
*  You render it virtually impossible. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=724.74s)]
*  If Palestinian statehood is going to emerge as a product of a consensual relationship [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=726.42s)]
*  and negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, if you were to take Gaza outside [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=731.54s)]
*  it becomes very difficult for those in Israel who would want to see Palestinian statehood. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=737.66s)]
*  The case for it becomes a lot weaker. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=742.42s)]
*  For us Palestinians we are one people, relatives, etc. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=745.54s)]
*  I myself had a lot of many personal experiences in Gaza. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=751.42s)]
*  Of course I visited Gaza long before I was stationed there as a resident on behalf of [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=756.8599999999999s)]
*  the IMF in late 1995. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=762.54s)]
*  I lived there, I know the place very well, and I can tell you I always had this premonition [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=767.3s)]
*  about Gaza separating. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=775.06s)]
*  I thought of it as different early on, driving from Jerusalem where I lived with my family [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=777.9399999999999s)]
*  just about daily basis. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=785.5s)]
*  Sometimes I would overnight in Gaza or stay a few days. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=787.06s)]
*  But as I went there I had this feeling that this is a state. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=791.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=797.5799999999999s)]
*  Because in the West Bank at the time there were settlements still in Gaza. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  There was an Israeli army still in Gaza but not visible. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=802.42s)]
*  You don't see them as you cross into Gaza, into Gaza Strip from north to south. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=806.2199999999999s)]
*  You don't see them unless you really drive way into Gaza. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=811.14s)]
*  And they were separate somehow. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=814.54s)]
*  But the minute you entered there you got this feeling that this is ours. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=816.74s)]
*  Somehow I felt, I used to feel this way. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=820.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=822.1800000000001s)]
*  Because in the West Bank, driving in the West Bank, you saw the army everywhere. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  This is an Israeli army that is. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=825.78s)]
*  But then a year or two into this, and particularly after the eruption of the second intifada [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=828.5s)]
*  and seeing all that was happening, I started to really think about this prospect of Palestinian [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=834.62s)]
*  statehood ever emerging as very much dependent on ensuring that Gaza and West Bank stay together. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=841.58s)]
*  So around the time when the idea of this engagement in Gaza was tabled by Israelis, I got worried [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  about what that might entail. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  And given the manner in which it was done, which was unilateral, not in negotiations [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=859.74s)]
*  with Palestinians, with Palestinian authority at the time, and there were many things, time [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=863.62s)]
*  for the deeper discussion into why I thought that a good part of the design was to lead [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=868.5400000000001s)]
*  to at least a different Palestinian entity in Gaza. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=874.46s)]
*  I know exactly what I'm talking about here for certain. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=878.22s)]
*  Just to give you a hint of what I'm talking about without getting into too much detail, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=882.1800000000001s)]
*  as part of the discussion surrounding the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, which was [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=886.58s)]
*  conducted at the time through the World Bank, I mean, were in vote. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=891.26s)]
*  I was a cabinet officer at the time, I was Minister of Finance at the time. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=894.86s)]
*  I heard that the Israelis had suggested that as part of this engagement exercise, the trading [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  arrangement between the Palestinian authority and Israel was going to change in Gaza from [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=908.1s)]
*  the equivalent of a customs union, for those of you who are not into this literature, what [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=913.9s)]
*  we really talk about, one customs area, to a free trade area, I asked, what about the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=919.54s)]
*  West Bank? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=925.6999999999999s)]
*  They said no, only for Gaza. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=926.6999999999999s)]
*  Now you stop and think about that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  Like why is that? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=929.6999999999999s)]
*  Why was that really even proposed? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=932.02s)]
*  What defines a country? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=934.14s)]
*  What as an entity? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  Security and trade regime. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=938.5799999999999s)]
*  You cannot have a country with different trade regimes. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=940.2199999999999s)]
*  The idea was to at least minimally make of Gaza a different Palestinian entity as a consequence [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=943.34s)]
*  or as a byproduct of that disengagement plan. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=951.34s)]
*  It didn't work, but unfortunately we kind of really hand delivered it in the form of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=954.74s)]
*  what happened in 2007, the violence takeover power by advancing Gaza at the time, and we [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=960.54s)]
*  have been separate since then. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=966.54s)]
*  So to really get anywhere near a path that could lead us to deliver us at some point, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=968.78s)]
*  under any scenario or plausible solution for this conflict, it is absolutely essential [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=975.9s)]
*  as an integral component of an empowerment strategy that we must embark upon. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=982.1s)]
*  Sooner rather than later, Gaza must be reintegrated into our polity, must be reintegrated with [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=988.98s)]
*  us back. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=995.74s)]
*  It must be brought back into the fold. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=996.94s)]
*  And I consider it a major failure of policy for that not having happened over so many [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=999.1s)]
*  years and it became very, very compelling after October 7, and it could have really [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1003.94s)]
*  added an instrument of pressure to end the war sooner rather than later. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1009.86s)]
*  Because to go to the Israelis and say, what about the day after the Palestinian Authority [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1014.62s)]
*  is ready to assume responsibility for the affairs of the Palestinian people in Gaza, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1019.46s)]
*  could have added and still could add to the instruments of influence that could be deployed [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1024.46s)]
*  to bring this war of aggression to an end today before tomorrow. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1030.3s)]
*  So Dr. Salem, there's a lot of threads for us to pull on here, but the one I want to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1034.7s)]
*  focus on now is the one you just raised, which is that the key, part of the key towards a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1038.9s)]
*  settlement to this problem, is there being a reunification of the Palestinian camp that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1047.02s)]
*  was cleaved in 2007, and you said that is a major failure. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1052.86s)]
*  Whose failure is it? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1057.4599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I think a good part of our history cannot be explained without looking at us through [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1058.6999999999998s)]
*  the prism of what factional rivalries did to us. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1067.3s)]
*  Most devastating. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1072.9399999999998s)]
*  And this is not new, and it predated actually Hamas. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1074.34s)]
*  Hamas came into being in 1987. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1077.86s)]
*  But factional rivalries, both between factions and within factions, actually have been a [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1081.38s)]
*  chief characteristic of our national movement. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1089.0600000000002s)]
*  It's about we were without representation, as everybody knows, and it was not before [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1093.0200000000002s)]
*  the PLO became recognized as our sole legitimate representative that the question started to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1098.94s)]
*  be settled. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1103.7800000000002s)]
*  And it started out with some Arab countries, Muslim countries, et cetera, and so on and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1104.7800000000002s)]
*  until we got to the point to 1993 where it became so recognized by everyone, including [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1110.38s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1117.1000000000001s)]
*  So when you have people who are not looked at through a political entity that is seen [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1119.38s)]
*  as its representative, people vying, factions vying for that representation engage in rivalries [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1132.34s)]
*  that I think were very damaging. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1144.26s)]
*  What's this rivalry about? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1147.54s)]
*  The rivalry between Hamas and Fatah? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1149.02s)]
*  What is it at root about? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1150.78s)]
*  Is it at root about different visions for Palestine? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1151.86s)]
*  One can look at it that way, for sure. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1158.74s)]
*  There are different ideologies. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1160.74s)]
*  And by the way, even before Hamas came into being, there were differences within the PLO, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1161.74s)]
*  actually within certain factions, within the PLO itself as to what might constitute an [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1169.06s)]
*  acceptable solution to us Palestinians. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1173.46s)]
*  Within Fatah itself, between Fatah and the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1178.54s)]
*  for example. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1182.8999999999999s)]
*  Ours is not a history of high degree of consensus or accord, except possibly for the period [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1184.26s)]
*  between 1988 and 1993. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1191.7s)]
*  There was a remarkable period of national consensus following the speech given by our [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1194.22s)]
*  late leader, Yasser Arafat, in Algiers in November of 1988 when he stood up before the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1199.8600000000001s)]
*  Palestinian National Council saying in the name of God, in the name of the Arab Palestinian [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1207.26s)]
*  people, the Palestinian National Council hereby declares the state of Palestine. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1213.1s)]
*  He was translating. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1218.42s)]
*  Everybody in the council, hundreds of delegates stood up in tears, cheering and all, including [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1219.9s)]
*  those who were opposed to the idea of accepting anything less than all of the land that we [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1226.14s)]
*  consider our ancestral land, that's Palestine. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1231.98s)]
*  It was not until the day after that some actually realized that the flip side of that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1235.62s)]
*  statement, given that it was made alongside consideration of what was called Palestinian [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1240.1799999999998s)]
*  Peace Initiative, which accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242 in particular, that [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1246.6599999999999s)]
*  actually meant a state on the territory of Israel occupied in 1967 that some within the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1253.78s)]
*  CPLO realized, oh, what have we agreed to? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1261.26s)]
*  Some dissent, but not that much dissent. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1266.14s)]
*  The speech was very well received and people were very much into this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1269.8200000000002s)]
*  For that five-year period, there was a remarkable degree of convergence within body politic [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1275.38s)]
*  in Palestine. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1281.22s)]
*  Hamas was there by that time, but at the time Hamas was not pulling more than 10%. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1282.22s)]
*  There was a great deal of support for the idea until the signing of the Oslo Accord [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1288.6599999999999s)]
*  in 1993. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1294.6999999999998s)]
*  At that point, there was a fracture. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1295.6999999999998s)]
*  Definitely at that point, there was a fracture because there's a difference between what [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1297.82s)]
*  people thought they might get out of the 1988 transformation and what Oslo promised with [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1301.62s)]
*  some particularly some thinkers, most notably Edward Said, for example, writing only one [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1309.02s)]
*  month after Oslo was signed. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1316.02s)]
*  How weak that was and how little it brought with it by way of recognition of any of our [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1319.46s)]
*  national rights. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1325.5s)]
*  That turned out to be prophetic for sure at the time he said it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1327.06s)]
*  It turned out to be really Achilles heel of the agreements because when you really look [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1330.78s)]
*  at what was written and what was agreed to, there's absolutely nothing in there that actually [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1335.3s)]
*  was about a solid promise of Palestinian statehood. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1341.74s)]
*  There was something that we Palestinians kind of hoped we would get out of it, particularly [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1345.46s)]
*  given the enormity of the concession relative to our own historical narrative we felt was [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1351.26s)]
*  made in 1988. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1358.58s)]
*  Our leadership felt it's a done deal for sure having made this huge concession. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1359.58s)]
*  For sure we're going to get the state. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1366.02s)]
*  The concession being recognizing Israel's right to exist. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1367.02s)]
*  And beyond that, what came with it relative to our own historical narrative that meant [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1370.82s)]
*  at most accepting a state on only 22% of land that we consider our ancestral land for sure [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1375.6599999999999s)]
*  relative to our own narrative. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1383.74s)]
*  So that the enormity of that concession as seen by Palestinians at the time led some [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1385.86s)]
*  to believe that for sure we're going to get the 22%. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1390.34s)]
*  We're asking for the 100%. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1392.9399999999998s)]
*  All we're looking for is 22%. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  For sure it's going to happen. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1396.1s)]
*  Beyond the strength of the goodwill that the signing of the accords brought with it, the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1397.46s)]
*  international community's desire to see it happen, et cetera. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1402.82s)]
*  So there was that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1407.1000000000001s)]
*  But then it didn't take too long before the promise of Oslo really started to falter. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1408.78s)]
*  So how we got onto this topic is, as you pointed out, that one of the real problems facing [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1414.9s)]
*  and part of the reason that the Palestinians have not been able to effectively represent [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1423.82s)]
*  themselves and one of the reasons maybe that we don't have a ceasefire yet is because of [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  the split within the Palestinian camp. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1437.4199999999998s)]
*  That a prerequisite to a solution is there has to be unification in the Palestinian camp. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1439.54s)]
*  And then the question was, why is there this split in the Palestinian camp, factional rivalries? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1444.46s)]
*  What are these factional rivalries about? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1450.06s)]
*  And now you've painted a picture for us where the factional rivalry is really about one [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1451.86s)]
*  faction that says, let's accept Israel within the 1967 borders and another faction that [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1456.78s)]
*  says what? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1466.34s)]
*  That well, we tried that and it didn't work? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1467.74s)]
*  And is that how we're supposed to understand Hamas? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1470.6999999999998s)]
*  That's part of the explanation. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1474.9199999999998s)]
*  They've been always competing visions and those predated Hamas as I said. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1476.68s)]
*  But the rivalry was not really, it was about representation as I said, with the focus being [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  a lot more on the privilege of representation. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1492.24s)]
*  What came with representation by way of privilege, not responsibility, not enough attention to [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1495.92s)]
*  what comes with the right to represent when you're so recognized, what comes with it [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1502.68s)]
*  by way of responsibility. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1508.3200000000002s)]
*  Here we come to the point about vision. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1511.28s)]
*  What is this program about? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1513.4s)]
*  What is the essence of this movement? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1516.92s)]
*  What is it about? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1518.6000000000001s)]
*  It's about deliverance. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  It's about freedom for our people. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1521.28s)]
*  It's about our people at some point getting to the point where they're able to enjoy that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1523.4s)]
*  which is a natural right for all peoples around the world, exercise the right to self-determination. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1528.0s)]
*  Including the right to be able to live as free people with dignity in our country. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1533.0s)]
*  How much of that was the driving force behind the differences of view and the rivalries? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1538.64s)]
*  Could explain some of it but not necessarily all of it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1545.16s)]
*  I'm afraid that only tells part of the story. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1548.88s)]
*  That only tells part of the story because if it were only about vision, if it's only [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1552.68s)]
*  about vision, there's a lot that can be said. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1556.68s)]
*  First of all, if the bet that was made on Oslo by the PLO in 1993 panned out, for sure [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1559.84s)]
*  all what we're really talking about will be just in the nature of an academic conversation, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1568.16s)]
*  basically reflecting on what could have happened relative to what actually happened. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1573.56s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1578.36s)]
*  Because the bet that was made succeeded, if it did succeed. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1579.36s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1583.96s)]
*  That's really what opened the Pandora's box for all kinds of questions and possibilities. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1584.96s)]
*  Because that bet failed, it made it possible for Hamas to build on the support that it [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1589.68s)]
*  had by people who were aligned with its values, given its Islamist tendencies and character [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1596.68s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1604.68s)]
*  You add to that all of those people who really saw in Oslo a betrayal, certainly legitimately [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1606.44s)]
*  so because of its failure to deliver on what they thought would come from Oslo. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1613.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, what really exposed us, so to speak, is the failure. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1619.44s)]
*  Had the bet worked out, this would have been an academic exercise conversation about what [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1623.44s)]
*  could have happened, what might have happened, etc. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1629.64s)]
*  A bet made by the PLO succeeding would have meant by now, a long time ago, a state and [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1633.24s)]
*  all of this would be just a conversation. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1640.04s)]
*  But it didn't. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1644.24s)]
*  You have to factor, then you have to ask questions like, why did that not happen? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1646.04s)]
*  Why did that not happen? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1650.44s)]
*  All we have really said about, or we have talked about so far, is our own failures. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1652.24s)]
*  And I'm someone who is really not at all shy to begin any conversation when it comes to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1656.44s)]
*  issues as important as August, as freedom for your people, than beginning with asking [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1663.24s)]
*  questions what our own responsibility is in that endeavor, before I look at anyone else. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1668.04s)]
*  But this is not to absolve Israel or other players from the failure. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1673.84s)]
*  Failure to deliver, failure to act when they could have and should have acted consistent [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1682.84s)]
*  with what needed to happen to produce the outcome that we all were looking for. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1688.4399999999998s)]
*  But the history on this is long. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1692.6399999999999s)]
*  It didn't take too long before, as a matter of fact, what was thought to be maybe a rocky [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1696.04s)]
*  period of five years leading to statehood at the end by May of 1999, it didn't quite [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1703.04s)]
*  pan out that way. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1709.6399999999999s)]
*  And one episode of disappointment and failure turned to another until the eruption of the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1711.6399999999999s)]
*  second intifada, then everything appeared at the time to have unraveled. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1719.6399999999999s)]
*  A little bit of promise, maybe a few years later, but then again, here we go. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  There we go again. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not really only us that we're playing here. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1730.64s)]
*  I, myself, if you allow me to say this, looking both at what is in Oslo itself and the directives [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1733.24s)]
*  given to the negotiating team that actually negotiate Oslo and the part of Israelis. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1742.24s)]
*  And I'm not quoting anyone here, but the record is there for anyone who wants to really go [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1748.24s)]
*  and look at it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1753.24s)]
*  As academics, I invite you, as a matter of fact, to really study the agreements themselves [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1754.84s)]
*  and see if there is not plausibility to what I'm about to suggest to you. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1760.84s)]
*  The agreements as they are written and structured, it's not a coincidence that they are not explicit [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1767.34s)]
*  on Palestinian statehood. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1774.64s)]
*  Because the directive given to the Israeli negotiating team was make statehood a possibility [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1776.84s)]
*  but not necessarily the outcome. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1783.4399999999998s)]
*  It was an autonomy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1786.54s)]
*  It was self-rule. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1787.9399999999998s)]
*  Palestinian authority was supposed to be a self-rule for a transitional period that was [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1791.9399999999998s)]
*  to culminate an agreement on permanent status issues, not statehood or anything like that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1798.1399999999999s)]
*  That self-rule agreement or arrangement enshrined in Oslo was a chapter in the Camp David Accord [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1804.84s)]
*  between Egypt and Israel, which Palestinians did not accept at the time. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1812.14s)]
*  And the legal team on the Israeli side that wrote that part in the Camp David Accord with [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1818.24s)]
*  Egypt was the same legal team that produced the Oslo Accords. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1824.44s)]
*  So that was there. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1828.64s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1830.3400000000001s)]
*  The speech that was given by late Prime Minister Rabin to the Knesset one month before he was [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1831.64s)]
*  assassinated, he presented his own vision to Knesset about what that Palestinian state [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1837.34s)]
*  was going to be like or not like. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1846.34s)]
*  And essentially what he said without really repeating the entire text and it's written [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1849.24s)]
*  and one can really actually Google it, essentially what he talked about was a state of leftovers, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1853.44s)]
*  essentially. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1860.04s)]
*  A state of leftovers with the West Bank. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1861.04s)]
*  That's basically what we talked about. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1863.24s)]
*  He said something less than a state. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1864.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1866.64s)]
*  There was a question for a period of time as to whether that represented Rabin's views [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1867.64s)]
*  himself or was it something that he felt he had to say in order to win approval by the [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1872.64s)]
*  Knesset for the Oslo Accords that was in 1995? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1878.14s)]
*  I'm not going to really go more into this, but the fact that he felt he had to give that [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1882.0400000000002s)]
*  speech regardless of whether or not he believed it suggested to me that even then, not today, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1887.5400000000002s)]
*  not the current government of Israel, even then the center of gravity of the body politic [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1895.04s)]
*  in Israel was not accepting the idea of Palestinian sovereignty anywhere on the territory between [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1900.4399999999998s)]
*  the Jordan and the Mediterranean. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1907.4399999999998s)]
*  That's basically the design. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1910.4399999999998s)]
*  So if you really take it from there, something extraordinary should have happened by way [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1912.74s)]
*  of transformation to produce Palestinian statehood and that didn't happen. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1917.04s)]
*  But the point that you're making here is you're saying, yes, the Palestinian leadership [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1922.64s)]
*  deserves tremendous blame for allowing these factional rivalries to prevent us from effectively [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1927.68s)]
*  working on behalf of statehood, but you are also saying that doesn't absolve the Israelis [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1936.94s)]
*  of the fact that they were never really into the idea that we would get our own state. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  Am I correct in understanding you that way? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1947.24s)]
*  I think that's fair characterization. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1949.14s)]
*  So I want to get to a few more questions and then I want to open it up and I've already [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1952.12s)]
*  consumed a lot of our time, so I'm going to ask you to be a little bit more laconic. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1958.6599999999999s)]
*  But I want to talk about Hamas. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1963.8s)]
*  This entity called Hamas, we've been talking about it a lot. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1967.4799999999998s)]
*  You may have seen David Brooks's column in the New York Times recently where he said, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1970.1s)]
*  look, if this war ends with a large chunk of Hamas in place, that would be a disaster. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1975.56s)]
*  And yet you have actually said, no, the way out of this is that there has to be some kind [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1982.24s)]
*  of national unity government, presumably, which would involve Hamas. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1988.16s)]
*  So what is David Brooks getting wrong here? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1992.82s)]
*  A lot, in my view. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1994.84s)]
*  Beginning with the fact that somehow when it comes to us, what is considered to be a [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=1998.1200000000001s)]
*  virtue just about everywhere in the world is somehow something we should not even consider, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2003.9s)]
*  contemplate or think is appropriate way of managing our own affairs. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2008.68s)]
*  How about pluralism? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2012.72s)]
*  You teach the importance of pluralism and everybody's talking about the virtues of it, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2015.88s)]
*  except that when it knocks on our door, Palestinians, somehow we really need to be monolithic. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2020.72s)]
*  Everybody has to be like everyone else. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  Everybody has to really say we agree with also nothing else in order for us to somehow [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2027.68s)]
*  audition for membership in society. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2034.04s)]
*  Something, something like that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2039.12s)]
*  We like all people around the world. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2041.6s)]
*  We are Palestinians, yes, but we have different persuasions, backgrounds, beliefs and all [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2044.68s)]
*  of that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2049.72s)]
*  The challenge for any society to be successful is to find a way to manage that pluralism, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2050.72s)]
*  manage it effectively, not to suppress it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2057.48s)]
*  If anything, you should encourage it, but the challenge is to find an effective way [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2061.24s)]
*  to manage it, and especially difficult for us given the history, given the context in [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2066.04s)]
*  which we are evolving and developing. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2071.2s)]
*  This is not unique to Palestinians, but it's made so in particular because we are under [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2074.4399999999996s)]
*  occupation because of the history, because effectively it had to involve Israel giving [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2080.08s)]
*  up something. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2085.8799999999997s)]
*  So it was not completely up to us in important ways. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2087.88s)]
*  So that's the first mistake that people make. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2093.36s)]
*  It's like, oh, the best way to really deal with this, if somehow we get rid of Hamas [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2096.44s)]
*  and like-minded factions, we have a solution. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2101.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, Hamas was not really much of a force to be reckoned with in 1993 when [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2104.44s)]
*  Oslo Accords were signed. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2109.32s)]
*  And PLO came into being, PA was established, and the rest of it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2111.32s)]
*  Had Oslo succeeded in delivering on the promise of status for Palestinians, history would [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2117.2000000000003s)]
*  be living in a different world together. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  Sorry not to interrupt you, but an Israeli might say part of the reason that Oslo failed [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2124.6400000000003s)]
*  was because Hamas and other groups like it engaged in acts of terror that made the Israelis [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2131.0s)]
*  think this is not going to be a workable solution. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2137.7200000000003s)]
*  I know they say that, and I know as a matter of fact it's no secret that I saw once myself [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2141.2s)]
*  a Hamas member of leadership, not exactly Politburo, but I forgot what his rank was [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2147.6s)]
*  at the time, taking credit for as a matter of fact having worked hard in order to derail [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2155.3199999999997s)]
*  Oslo. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2160.72s)]
*  But on the Israeli side, guess who ran on a platform to annul Oslo completely, cancel [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2161.72s)]
*  it all. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2169.44s)]
*  Someone by the name Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2170.48s)]
*  His first run at premiership was in May of 1996, and his campaign was about doing away [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2172.64s)]
*  with Oslo. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2180.04s)]
*  That was in 1996 himself. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2181.04s)]
*  And this is all bogus, it shouldn't be, etc. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2183.56s)]
*  So this is a debate, I think we can talk about it, and how Israel used and projected security [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2187.7200000000003s)]
*  as paramount, component of what really wanted to accomplish out of this. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2196.92s)]
*  But it's, Israelis who really would insist on making that point and not really look at [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2201.56s)]
*  the other side of the equation would be hard pressed to explain why it is that when security [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2207.28s)]
*  conditions in the West Bank improved markedly for about four to five years, with violence [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  declined to virtually nothing in the aftermath of the Second Intifada, they did nothing to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2220.84s)]
*  change their security policies in the West Bank. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2226.4s)]
*  They did not stop sending the troops into so-called Area A, meaning urban areas of the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2229.28s)]
*  West Bank when they could have. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2234.6800000000003s)]
*  They used to say, we have to do this because Palestinians are not taking care of security, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  look at what happened in Intifada and all of that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2241.32s)]
*  So if security is established in the West Bank, if the Palestinian Authority proves [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2243.4s)]
*  it can do this, for sure we will no longer be sending the troops into the cities of the [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  West Bank, as was required under Oslo. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  The West Bank was the departing from in the spring of 2002. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2255.64s)]
*  So the expectation was that if security were to improve, they would stop doing this. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2258.8399999999997s)]
*  Guess what happened? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2263.48s)]
*  Security by all measures and indications, including international observers, Israelis [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2264.8399999999997s)]
*  themselves, acknowledged the vast improvement in security and they resisted any, they rejected [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2270.12s)]
*  even having any conversations about stopping the incursion. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2277.04s)]
*  I don't want to really cite names of people here, whether they are former officials or [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2281.44s)]
*  anything like that, it's not good protocol. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2286.0s)]
*  But I myself was told by Israeli officials, I'm not going to name them, if what you're [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2288.48s)]
*  really talking about is return to September 28 positions, and that's a reference to the [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  date on which the second Intifada erupted. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2299.6400000000003s)]
*  Don't think about it because Israel will always and forever be in charge of security in the [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2302.88s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2308.6s)]
*  I myself was told that in the first meeting I had with the senior Israeli official, after [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2309.64s)]
*  I became prime minister, at which point I said, all right, salam alaikum. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2315.04s)]
*  If that is the case, take it, occupy it, manage it, do everything. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2318.92s)]
*  And what happened as a matter of fact, things worked out, security was improved, and all [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2326.7599999999998s)]
*  I was asking for, meeting after meeting after meeting, deploying all kinds of diplomacy [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2331.12s)]
*  through the United States, everyone else wanted to listen. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2337.84s)]
*  The one thing that we needed more than anything else, in addition of course to stopping settlement [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2341.12s)]
*  activity, was to get Israel to stop sending the troops into the cities of West Bank because [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2345.12s)]
*  that would signal to people that what we're doing was consistent with the idea of getting [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2350.36s)]
*  to statehood. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2356.04s)]
*  Because people then would see that actually what we're talking about is not only an exercise [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2357.44s)]
*  in improving their livelihood, which is essential under any condition, but actually it was going [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2361.88s)]
*  to deliver on the promise of us being able to live as free people in... [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2366.84s)]
*  Without Israeli troops. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2371.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2372.56s)]
*  And they didn't. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2373.56s)]
*  So if they say Hamas kind of really spoiled it, I think they did enough spoiling themselves. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2374.56s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2380.04s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2382.08s)]
*  But just to talk about Hamas briefly. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2383.08s)]
*  So when the question I asked was about David Brooks's proposition that including Hamas [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2385.52s)]
*  would be catastrophic, that Hamas needs to be eradicated. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2392.28s)]
*  I'm assuming your position is that Hamas can't be eradicated and that it is a valid or legitimate [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  part of the Palestinian body politic. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2403.52s)]
*  And I guess the other thing that I know you to believe is that nonviolence is a non-negotiable, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
*  it's a rock bottom commitment I know of yours. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2413.3599999999997s)]
*  So how do you square that with the idea of Hamas being a legitimate part of the Palestinian [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2415.72s)]
*  body politic that needs to be at the table? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2421.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the PLO itself was about armed struggle. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2423.6s)]
*  So-called contemporary Palestinian revolution started out as an armed resistance long before [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2428.36s)]
*  there was any conversation about negotiations or anything like that. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2435.48s)]
*  When the idea of diplomacy within Palestinian ranks to get a state on part of Palestine [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2439.08s)]
*  started to kind of be considered within the PLO in the mid-70s. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2447.12s)]
*  But before that, I mean, I was talking about armed struggle and all. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2452.16s)]
*  So this is not exactly new to thinking. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not the first time- [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2459.72s)]
*  Your idea is that, sorry, forgive me. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2460.72s)]
*  Your idea is that the transformation that the PLO underwent is one that Hamas could [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2462.2799999999997s)]
*  undergo if they were brought into some kind of political process? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2467.08s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2470.8799999999997s)]
*  It has not been tested. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2471.8799999999997s)]
*  It happened. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2473.56s)]
*  All we know it happened. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2474.56s)]
*  We know it happened in the form of the PLO having undertaken, having gone through that [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2475.56s)]
*  kind of real transformation. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2481.44s)]
*  It happened before. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2482.44s)]
*  So whether or not that could happen again is something else. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2483.88s)]
*  But then as a practical matter, we look at what is doable. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2486.48s)]
*  To start the conversation by saying, you know, we need to eliminate these forces and factions [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2491.2400000000002s)]
*  before something like that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2496.6800000000003s)]
*  They call them spoilers to kind of really deal with the spoilers as if it's really something [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2498.28s)]
*  that is totally under control to kind of exclude somebody. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2503.28s)]
*  When you're talking about ideologies and political movements, I think it's just totally wrong [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2507.2000000000003s)]
*  to speak in those terms to begin with. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2511.28s)]
*  Hamas is a political movement. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2513.44s)]
*  It's an ideology. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2515.8s)]
*  So therefore, it cannot be destroyed. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2516.8s)]
*  For sure. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2518.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the idea. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  So starting the war under that objective of eradicating, eliminating Hamas and all of [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2520.7200000000003s)]
*  that, and even objectives stated by Israel subsequently. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2526.7200000000003s)]
*  When I say Israel, I mean government of Israel. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  Repeatedly, if it's not this objective, if you actually go through these war objectives [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2533.32s)]
*  as enunciated by the government of Israel, they all, in my humble opinion, range from [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2539.56s)]
*  the impossible to the highly unattainable. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2544.92s)]
*  And ideologies cannot, you can't destroy ideologies. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2548.04s)]
*  You can't defeat them with the more competitive ideologies, something that really appeals [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2552.14s)]
*  to people. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2555.9s)]
*  My ideas involve going back to the people at some point, elections, through a transitional [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2556.9s)]
*  period. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2561.7999999999997s)]
*  You cannot get Hamas or Islamic Jihad, we're not talking about them, or others within Palestinian [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2562.7999999999997s)]
*  body politic, who still believe in armed struggle and all of that. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2567.8s)]
*  And there are more of them today than there were before. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2572.0s)]
*  But what you can get them to agree to is commitment to nonviolence during transitional period, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2577.8s)]
*  for example. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2583.4s)]
*  I mean, you do, you go for what you can get. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2584.4s)]
*  That's something I would expect. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2586.88s)]
*  Could you spell this proposal out? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2589.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2591.48s)]
*  To move from A to C, you need to cover the period between A to B now. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2593.02s)]
*  So to move from where we are to where we need to be, going to people and having people elect [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2598.46s)]
*  their representatives and government, which is not practical in the here and now, but [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2605.74s)]
*  it must, at some point, you need to go through a certain transition. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2612.74s)]
*  My proposal was to actually expand the PLO to include those excluded from it so far, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2617.38s)]
*  like Hamas, like Islamic Jihad and all of that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2624.2200000000003s)]
*  And to have the expanded PLO consent to a government that's non-factional, does not [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2626.82s)]
*  have on it Hamas, Jihad or... [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2631.34s)]
*  Technocrats. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2634.34s)]
*  Yeah, for a transitional period, multi-year transitional period. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2635.34s)]
*  Test with managing the affairs of Palestinian people, both in Gaza and the West Bank, during [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2638.82s)]
*  which time there is an ironclad commitment to nonviolence by everyone. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2643.86s)]
*  During the transitional period? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2648.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes, everywhere. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2649.1800000000003s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2650.1800000000003s)]
*  That's acceptable. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2651.1800000000003s)]
*  Hamas would accept that. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2652.1800000000003s)]
*  Hamas was dealing on that basis with Israel before, through Egypt, through others, etc. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2653.6600000000003s)]
*  Understandings of that kind. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2660.06s)]
*  So that's doable. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2661.34s)]
*  And then to have elections at the end of that transitional period, date certain for which [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2662.98s)]
*  would be announced at the start of the transition period. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2667.42s)]
*  That's the kind of transition I was really thinking about at the time. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2670.1s)]
*  But back to something you said about nonviolence. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2674.38s)]
*  I could hear, sorry, forgive me, I could hear an Israeli saying, well at the end of this [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2675.94s)]
*  transitional period, you'll have the election and Hamas will win the election and then we're [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2679.8199999999997s)]
*  back where we started. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2686.98s)]
*  Well, look, they can say that and... [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2688.3399999999997s)]
*  Would they be right? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2691.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, they could be right, but I would say, look who's talking, if somebody were [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2692.8199999999997s)]
*  to say that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2699.14s)]
*  Look at the government that Israel currently has. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2700.14s)]
*  I mean, I wonder, I'm really serious about this. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2703.54s)]
*  Israel has in its ranks now, in its government, cabinet officers who are on record, not only [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2707.8199999999997s)]
*  opposing the idea of concept Palestinian status, but even the feeble Palestinian authority, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2715.66s)]
*  which is a self-rule body. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2721.42s)]
*  That's what we're really talking about. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2725.22s)]
*  Cabinet officers sitting on the current government of Israel saying, we Palestinians have one [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2727.1s)]
*  of three choices, either conform to whatever this oppressive occupation wants us to really [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2732.8199999999997s)]
*  do or whatever, conform and live and accept it as it is, leave, that's another option, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2738.46s)]
*  and if you choose to resist, you're killed. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2746.86s)]
*  So that's a government that Israel elections produced. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2750.9s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2755.7400000000002s)]
*  So what I'm really saying is, let this process run its course. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2757.1800000000003s)]
*  Let us... [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2762.1800000000003s)]
*  So we'll have two extremist elected governments. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2763.1800000000003s)]
*  Look, if that were to happen, if that's to happen, that's better than we are right now. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2765.46s)]
*  Right now, we have not had elections in a very long period of time. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2770.98s)]
*  The fact that we could have that outcome should not stop us from having elections. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2775.02s)]
*  When we do have elections that should be inclusive and everybody should be invited, my own sense [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  is in fact we go through the transition that I'm talking to you about, if people really [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2785.26s)]
*  get enough of a chance to look at an alternative and what could be possible and regenerate [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2789.46s)]
*  sense of possibility about Palestinian status and all of that, there is also distinct possibility [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2798.98s)]
*  that elections could produce a different outcome. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2805.14s)]
*  So you wanted to say something up quickly about nonviolence. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2808.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2810.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2811.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you said something about my own position. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2812.8199999999997s)]
*  That's something I wholeheartedly believe in. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2816.54s)]
*  Not only because it meets the alternative, in my view. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2819.58s)]
*  Nonviolence has a deeply intrinsic, immense inner strength and value to it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2823.98s)]
*  That is vastly underappreciated. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2831.58s)]
*  And I really think it's the one platform that we should stand on and it's the one that really [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2833.62s)]
*  can deliver us if we really actually focus on developing a strategy of self-empowerment. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2838.02s)]
*  One that is actually based on the notion that freedom is not given to us. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2845.5s)]
*  We will it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2850.38s)]
*  We were free because we will to be free, not because we're waiting for Israel to really [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2851.38s)]
*  give us that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2855.02s)]
*  You start with that and you really begin to ask your question, what is really the most [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2856.2599999999998s)]
*  important thing for us to do? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2859.94s)]
*  To ensure that our people continue to be able to stand the adversity of occupation. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2861.86s)]
*  Live in the face of the occupation. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2869.6200000000003s)]
*  Confront the occupation by insisting on projecting the reality of that state that we want on [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2871.7000000000003s)]
*  the ground in spite of the occupation on the way to ending it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2877.34s)]
*  That's what I really believe in. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2881.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2882.1800000000003s)]
*  A strategy like this, underpinned by total commitment to nonviolence. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2883.1800000000003s)]
*  Resistance by existing. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2888.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2889.6200000000003s)]
*  Resistance by existing. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2890.62s)]
*  Resistance by insisting on projecting the reality of the state that you say you want. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2891.62s)]
*  That's what I believe in. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2896.74s)]
*  So I want to get to that and I think the way we can do this is in a kind of, I want to [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2897.74s)]
*  put to you a few propositions that we have heard, some of which we've heard on this stage [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2903.3399999999997s)]
*  about the conflict and I want to get your reactions, your brief reactions to that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2909.92s)]
*  So the first proposition we've heard is this war could end right now if Hamas would just [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2916.18s)]
*  release the hostages. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2923.7s)]
*  You said brief? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2925.18s)]
*  Yes, yes, please. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2927.4199999999996s)]
*  Because I have a, yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2928.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, ten minutes. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2930.8599999999997s)]
*  I had, okay look, that's been said from the very beginning. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2932.8599999999997s)]
*  I remind you. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2939.62s)]
*  I myself actually called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2941.46s)]
*  days into this and that should have happened. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2946.98s)]
*  Hamas said that they were prepared to do something like this if they were assured that they could [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2951.2200000000003s)]
*  have safe passage and something like that. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2957.18s)]
*  It didn't happen, then we went through these negotiations and all of that sort of thing. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2958.82s)]
*  Now it has become a part of the expectation that if there is going to be a release of [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2963.7400000000002s)]
*  hostages, there's going to be a release of Palestinian prisoners as well. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2968.9s)]
*  Those discussions have gone through some difficulties over the past few weeks. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2972.6200000000003s)]
*  I hope that among other things, the resolution that was passed by the Security Council on [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2980.46s)]
*  calling for immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages would rekindle interest in those [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2989.1400000000003s)]
*  negotiations and lead to the release of hostages in the way that could happen realistically. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=2996.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3002.38s)]
*  The second proposition that we've heard here is Hamas could have turned Gaza into a Singapore, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3003.38s)]
*  but instead it chose to invest in rockets and tunnels. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3009.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, there are not many Singapores around the world. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3012.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a high bar. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3017.46s)]
*  Well, listen, leave that aside. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3018.46s)]
*  Could have turned it into something better. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3019.46s)]
*  That's a high bar under the best conditions. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3021.62s)]
*  The conditions in Gaza are kind of really far removed from being ideal conditions under [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3024.1800000000003s)]
*  which you can really create that kind of reality. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3029.1000000000004s)]
*  Gaza, also the West Bank, there are some who say Gaza has been under siege since 2007. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3032.3s)]
*  Gaza has been under siege for a much longer period of time. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3038.9s)]
*  It's very difficult to see how you can bring about sustainable economic development and [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3043.2200000000003s)]
*  prosperity under those conditions of siege and restrictions and all. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3047.3s)]
*  Even minus that, economic development is not an easy undertaking, even under steady state [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3051.86s)]
*  conditions. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3059.46s)]
*  When you have this kind of instability, wars, incursions, rounds of escalation one after [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  another, no freedom of movement to people and goods and all of that, how are you going [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3067.06s)]
*  to really bring about even modest economic development, much less the success that Singapore [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3072.06s)]
*  has been? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3079.6200000000003s)]
*  But, sorry, Dr. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3081.42s)]
*  And then I would have to say the idea that somehow if only we were to find a way to get [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3082.62s)]
*  people busy, make better living, and all that, that somehow would forget about the importance [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3092.58s)]
*  or value to them of living as free people in a country of their own, would dissipate, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3100.46s)]
*  would go away, become less important. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3105.8199999999997s)]
*  It simply doesn't work. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3108.26s)]
*  But it's Fayyadism. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3110.26s)]
*  What I'm saying is if Salim Fayyad had been in charge of Gaza, you wouldn't have governed [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3111.98s)]
*  it in exactly the same way that Hamas did. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3117.18s)]
*  I tell you where I'm different on this is I believe that economic development can be [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3119.46s)]
*  designed in a way that would serve the dual purpose of, on the one hand, doing the necessary [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3126.86s)]
*  because what is it that you're really doing when you invest in education, when you invest [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3134.42s)]
*  in better health care and all of that sort of thing, you're investing in your own people. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3138.78s)]
*  That ought to be the first and most immediate goal of development and a sensible, rational [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3144.2200000000003s)]
*  development strategy. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3149.5s)]
*  But in our case, it would serve this other important purpose of establishing the imperative [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3151.1800000000003s)]
*  of this really turning into the independent political entity that we want it to be. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3160.1400000000003s)]
*  In other words, do the necessary because it's necessary, but on the strength of succeeding [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3164.78s)]
*  on doing that, you gain the sovereignty. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3169.38s)]
*  Was that not an option for Hamas in Gaza? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3171.98s)]
*  I don't know if they really thought about this. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3174.9s)]
*  I can tell you I thought this way, but I failed. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3176.94s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3180.42s)]
*  Yeah, I failed. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3182.42s)]
*  I mean, it didn't work. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3183.42s)]
*  There are many reasons why it didn't work, but that's basically what I was betting on. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3185.42s)]
*  So a lot of people took issue. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3190.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, so what are you doing? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3191.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, you're building roads and things like this schools, but we are under occupation. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3194.38s)]
*  I'd say necessary to do because to end the occupation means as the first step toward [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3197.98s)]
*  that is to ensure that you're going to be able to stand the adverse of being under occupation [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3203.86s)]
*  to get to the point where we are state. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3208.3s)]
*  So when the political end was not delivered on that basically was exposed as nothing more [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3210.86s)]
*  than exercise and what Netanyahu calls economic peace and economic peace is not going to wash. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3217.42s)]
*  Okay, so the other proposition that you always hear is Palestinians could have had a state, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3223.22s)]
*  but they walked away from every deal that would have given it to them. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3229.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's to say that's often repeated that we do not miss an opportunity to miss one. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3233.18s)]
*  You know, David, you know, we we failed because we keep on saying no, no, no, no. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3240.66s)]
*  I have to tell you, we did not fare too well on countless times. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3247.74s)]
*  We said yes either. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3252.14s)]
*  So there must be some other reason. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3253.74s)]
*  I accept. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3256.8599999999997s)]
*  I accept this as an element in a bigger conversation in a longer list. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3258.42s)]
*  But to really say we failed because of this, I think it's a little unfair. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3264.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3268.42s)]
*  Another proposition that we often hear, I hear this a lot from Israeli friends of mine. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3269.42s)]
*  When they know that I spent some time with you, they say, oh, if the Palestinians only [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3274.18s)]
*  had leaders like Salam Fayyad, this entire problem would have been solved already. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3277.56s)]
*  That's an oversimplification, gross oversimplification. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3282.06s)]
*  Well, my question to them is what did you do when you had a leader like Salam Fayyad [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3288.14s)]
*  who was prime minister for six years? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3293.22s)]
*  I just mentioned to you one factor as a matter of fact. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3296.9s)]
*  It could have made a difference. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3300.14s)]
*  It really could have made a difference because you always look at you describing as a technocrat [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3301.74s)]
*  or something. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3307.34s)]
*  The minute you join the government as a cabinet officer, even before you're prime minister [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3308.7000000000003s)]
*  or anything like that, you can't say you're just a technocrat. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3312.58s)]
*  You can't say, oh, I'm just an accountant. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3315.98s)]
*  Well, I'm just like fixing this and all of that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3317.38s)]
*  You have to project the entity you serve on. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3320.34s)]
*  You're a politician. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3324.7000000000003s)]
*  You're not full-time politician. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3326.1800000000003s)]
*  You have a trade, et cetera. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3328.06s)]
*  Yes, that's for sure. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3329.58s)]
*  The fact of the matter, there is a game of politics that needs to be played. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3332.14s)]
*  And I can tell you for sure it's something I understand. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3338.5s)]
*  There were detractors. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3341.8199999999997s)]
*  There were detractors because there were a lot of people invested in the prevailing status quo [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3343.3399999999997s)]
*  at the time. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3348.1s)]
*  And that cut against the grain. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3349.18s)]
*  So it was expected. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3350.8199999999997s)]
*  So I can't just like, oh, what's going on? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3351.98s)]
*  Why can't I really see the wisdom of what I see? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3354.02s)]
*  You can't really have that kind of attitude. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3356.7s)]
*  You just really need to accept that you could be wrong and engage in debate and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3359.02s)]
*  conversations with people. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3363.1s)]
*  What I was really banking on is to prove beyond any doubt to the detractors, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3364.46s)]
*  to the skeptics. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3370.18s)]
*  And there were many, actually, in the ranks of academics, intellectuals, and all. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3370.98s)]
*  I'm not really talking to you, who really actually, from the very beginning, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3375.1s)]
*  were saying, this is really absolutely naive. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3378.7s)]
*  How do you think you can ever build a state under occupation, all of that, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3382.06s)]
*  just like that? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3386.26s)]
*  Some thought it made too much sense. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3387.62s)]
*  Some thought it made enough sense. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3390.86s)]
*  They were kind of really maybe, you know, maybe someone else should have thought [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3393.06s)]
*  about this. It's so obvious. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3397.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3399.02s)]
*  So you engage in these kinds of conversations. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3399.5s)]
*  And I used to, in the most open of ways, with media people, with students, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3402.1s)]
*  with everyone else. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3408.62s)]
*  And the knock on this was always that it's impossible to do under occupation. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3409.9s)]
*  And how can you really prove them wrong? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3414.54s)]
*  Only if, in fact, it had delivered on what could have begun to suggest to people [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3418.5s)]
*  that statehood is on the horizon. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3425.02s)]
*  And the one thing that could have made the difference was if, in fact, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3426.54s)]
*  we could have rolled the Israeli presence in the military sense in the West Bank to [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3429.94s)]
*  what it was up until September 28, 2000. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3434.94s)]
*  If that had happened, then you could have said, see, it's not really only about [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3438.82s)]
*  improving livelihood and living conditions, but this whole strategy, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3444.46s)]
*  including the component of nonviolence of it, it actually rests on it, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3449.26s)]
*  importantly, can lead to statehood. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3453.62s)]
*  Because when people begin to see their own security as opposed to the Israeli [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3455.94s)]
*  army, that begins to really conjure up images of sovereignty of their own [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3459.54s)]
*  presence. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3463.9s)]
*  It was not a coincidence, therefore, that not only was I asking for the Israeli [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3464.54s)]
*  army to stop sending the troops into so-called area A or urban areas, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3469.26s)]
*  but actually to begin to have Palestinian security presence in area C, in villages, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3473.62s)]
*  in rural areas, modest. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3480.54s)]
*  I mean, I understand the difficulty of saying it, in a modest way, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3482.38s)]
*  so people could see their own security as opposed to the Israeli army. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3485.06s)]
*  Things like this would have made the difference, and they were not done. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3488.66s)]
*  So regardless of what is told about this great experiment and all of that sort [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3492.58s)]
*  of thing, I think in practice, very little was done to support it. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3496.54s)]
*  And I would argue that actually in many ways, the actions were taken that [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3500.54s)]
*  contributed to its demise politically. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3505.54s)]
*  Okay, so the last one, and then I'm going to open it up, is you hear this from a [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3507.58s)]
*  lot of Americans who will say, oh, if only Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3512.42s)]
*  not been assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995, this problem would have [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3517.86s)]
*  been solved already. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3522.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there are a lot of people who would believe that. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3526.34s)]
*  God knows what would have happened had the process continued. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3529.42s)]
*  I just cited to you what he said in 1995, one month before he was assassinated. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3533.94s)]
*  Now, did he really actually mean it? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3540.82s)]
*  If he did, God knows how much longer he would have stayed as Prime Minister [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3543.3s)]
*  anyway, but we know what happened after he died. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3549.58s)]
*  So again, I think there's just so much resistance to the idea of Palestinian [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3553.94s)]
*  statehood or anything sovereign other than Israel sovereignty in the territory. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3561.98s)]
*  Well, I'm really skeptical about that. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3570.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not really saying statehood could not have happened under any condition. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3572.98s)]
*  I'm not really saying this was doomed, but a lot of things had to really have [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3577.6200000000003s)]
*  a lot of things had to happen in a vastly different way to produce that outcome. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3583.1400000000003s)]
*  In other words, the deck was stacked against the possibility of a statehood. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3587.7400000000002s)]
*  So a lot of things had to happen right on all sides to prove everybody wrong. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3592.1400000000003s)]
*  In the way the agreement itself was structured, in the way Israel was not [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3599.1000000000004s)]
*  ready to accept a Palestinian state alongside it, and this is deep and it [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3603.82s)]
*  became a lot deeper over time to where we are right now. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3608.5800000000004s)]
*  People say two-state solution without defining it. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3613.6600000000003s)]
*  Jared Kushner was here and he had a hand in putting together the famous Trump [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3617.2200000000003s)]
*  plan and all of that sort of thing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3623.94s)]
*  But that can also, I mean, in a technical sense, that's a two-state solution. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3625.7400000000002s)]
*  But is it a kind of state that Palestinians can really find acceptable? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3630.78s)]
*  Obviously not. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3635.34s)]
*  But by the way, I just say this in passing, since you mentioned the [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3636.5s)]
*  assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3640.02s)]
*  By the way, if you look at what was presented by Donald Trump in January [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3642.94s)]
*  of 2020, that plan and what that speech by Rabin implied in 1995, you would [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3650.06s)]
*  find them virtually completely the same. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3657.94s)]
*  Why? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3660.3s)]
*  I mean, on two key issues, on question of territory and on question of sovereignty. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3660.66s)]
*  Because on territory, in the Rabin speech of 1995, he said that, first of all, the [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3665.86s)]
*  settlements, in the way he referred to them in the speech, are going to be under [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3674.54s)]
*  Israeli sovereignty. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3677.86s)]
*  We'll talk about the West Bank, the settlement of West Bank. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3678.62s)]
*  They're going to be under Israeli sovereignty. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3680.94s)]
*  That, you know, security was going to be, Israel will have security in the Jordan [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3682.98s)]
*  Valley, defined in the broadest possible sense of the world. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3690.14s)]
*  Jordan Valley constitutes about 25% of the landmass of West Bank. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3694.98s)]
*  And so you add 25% to the area of settlements, that's about 30%, maybe a [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3699.1s)]
*  little bit more. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3704.5s)]
*  How much did the Trump plan offer the Palestinians out of West Bank? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3705.66s)]
*  70%. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3710.66s)]
*  So on territory, it's very comparable. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3712.18s)]
*  So the map appears to have been the same, more or less. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3714.42s)]
*  Now on sovereignty, you called it, Rabin, as having said something [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3717.46s)]
*  minus, state minus. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3721.02s)]
*  Trump plan did not have Palestinian sovereignty at all. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3724.26s)]
*  Actually, the plan itself specifically stated that Israel would have overriding [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3727.5s)]
*  zoning authority over areas east of the border, meaning in Palestinian state, in [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3732.66s)]
*  areas close to the border, without defining what that means. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3742.54s)]
*  But given how narrow that strip of land is, that could have been like maybe [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3747.22s)]
*  heartland of Ramallah, zoning authority. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3752.62s)]
*  So basically, that's what we're looking at. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3755.66s)]
*  What I'm telling you is that a lot has to change, you know, beginning with [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3758.42s)]
*  recognition of our right, formal recognition by the government of Israel of our right [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3763.42s)]
*  to a fully sovereign state on the territory Israel occupied in 1967. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3769.94s)]
*  I call for that to be the starting point for negotiations if we're really serious [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3774.34s)]
*  about anything. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3779.1400000000003s)]
*  This is not to say we'll not negotiate borders or any other aspects of statehood, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3780.1800000000003s)]
*  but we need first, before we begin the process, a formal recognition of our right [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3784.1000000000004s)]
*  to it, every square inch of it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3789.6200000000003s)]
*  That's what needs to happen. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3791.9s)]
*  We offered Israel recognition of its right to exist in peace and security in 1993. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3793.1800000000003s)]
*  It's about time for that circle to be squared. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3798.86s)]
*  OK. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3801.1000000000004s)]
*  So I have many more questions, but I cannot leave this room alive unless I turn it [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3801.66s)]
*  over to the audience. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3805.98s)]
*  So I have I'm going to take a couple of questions from my students. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3807.34s)]
*  By the way, I have time. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3810.3s)]
*  No, and I suspect they will take all of the time that you have. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3811.5s)]
*  So the first person I have is Abhi Rajkumar. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3816.34s)]
*  Me and a few other students from the Kennedy School have just come back from a trip [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3818.86s)]
*  to Israel, including the Gaza border region and parts of East Jerusalem. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3825.1s)]
*  One thing I found the most surprising was speaking to some Palestinian community leaders [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3829.46s)]
*  who spoke about the idea of a one state solution where everyone simply lived with equal rights [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3833.7400000000002s)]
*  and equal access to opportunities. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3839.02s)]
*  And as an Australian, that sounds like a very good example of a one state solution. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3840.94s)]
*  Is that the reason why in Israel when the world view of Israel is transformed? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3844.7s)]
*  What are the members for which Israel gears loose in his will? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3850.1s)]
*  The question that there is now. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3854.74s)]
*  Is that why Very much that does not promise 7% of the world's population? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3856.22s)]
*  Or is that the reason why? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3863.2599999999998s)]
*  And was the discovery of persecuting communities was actually something that Evangelical [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3864.8199999999997s)]
*  thin airmongers, what you are eating today, by tribes or communities, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3869.34s)]
*  now with many not necessarily speaking or considering one state solution as a solution [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3873.78s)]
*  but as a reality, as a reality. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3885.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's the reality that has been unfolding for a number of years and not only over the [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3888.1600000000003s)]
*  past couple of years. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3892.52s)]
*  It has been unfolding for a long period of time and you consider and look at what is [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3894.5600000000004s)]
*  on the settlement front, settlement expansion, the rest of it, how disjointed the West Bank [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3899.68s)]
*  has become even in Gaza, Euro settlers moved out of Gaza back in 2005 as you know, but [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3904.8399999999997s)]
*  the settlements of West Bank, if anything, and settlement communities, they have expanded [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3912.0s)]
*  substantially as you well know. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3917.04s)]
*  So that brought with it in the progressive way a one state reality that is not acceptable. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3919.32s)]
*  It certainly is not acceptable, should not be accepted to us Palestinians before we even [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3930.7200000000003s)]
*  begin to think about what that might look like from Israel's point of view. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3935.0800000000004s)]
*  So that's what we have unfolding before our eyes. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3940.36s)]
*  It's not acceptable because we definitely are not full fledged citizens in that one [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3943.8s)]
*  state reality. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3949.04s)]
*  Obviously we're not. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3950.04s)]
*  And that is really the agony. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3951.96s)]
*  That's the kind of trap we find ourselves in, in one important way. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3954.6000000000004s)]
*  Because unless we somehow find a way to get out of the entrapment that Oslo has ended [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3959.6400000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're going to be in that space. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3968.28s)]
*  A weak Palestinian authority in the way that it is, it has been, and it will continue to [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3975.52s)]
*  be unless it is reconfigured politically and enabled politically, in a way actually has [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3981.8s)]
*  turned into an instrument of disempowerment for us Palestinians before anyone else. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3989.28s)]
*  If you talk to, for example, Netanyahu or someone else who they don't like the idea [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=3995.6s)]
*  of Palestinian statehood, and you say, but then look, you are an apartheid state, you [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4002.24s)]
*  know what his answer would be? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4007.16s)]
*  No, we're not. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4008.52s)]
*  Your Palestinians have representation. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4010.2799999999997s)]
*  They have a Palestinian authority. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4012.8799999999997s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4014.56s)]
*  Looks like they have even passports, they have this, that, the other thing. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4015.56s)]
*  So anyway, all that it is doing is providing a free service by continuing to be in the [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4018.0s)]
*  weak shape it is. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4025.68s)]
*  However, to those who say it's an easy thing to really get out of this trap by dismantling [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4027.76s)]
*  the PA, I'd say think again, how can you possibly even do that? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4033.32s)]
*  It has become so much intertwined in Palestinian lives. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4038.48s)]
*  Can you really begin to imagine how difficult the task it is to undo it? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4045.44s)]
*  I think the only sensible solution that is before us is to actually strengthen it. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4049.32s)]
*  If it was meant to be weak so that it would not turn into a state by design and would [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4055.12s)]
*  end up being an instrument of disempowerment, actually we should rebel against that, not [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4063.56s)]
*  by dismantling it, but actually strengthening it to ensure that it can actually more transition [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4068.48s)]
*  to and transform itself into a state. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4077.4s)]
*  The idea of really staying in this position of weak but not too weak to completely fall [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4081.48s)]
*  and cease to be of value to Israel, but not ever strong enough to become a state, that's [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4089.84s)]
*  what we really should understand and we should definitely strive to strengthen it. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4094.6s)]
*  So it could become a state, de facto safe, before it's so recognized. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4098.38s)]
*  The next person I have is Nitzan Maklas. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4103.54s)]
*  My name is Nitzan Maklas. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4109.1s)]
*  I'm an MPP student at the Kennedy School from Israel. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4110.1s)]
*  Mr. Fayad, you have argued for a reformed PLO to be expanded to include all major Palestinian [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4113.06s)]
*  political factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4117.3s)]
*  But by increasing power to such non-state actors without necessitating the disarmament, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4120.78s)]
*  Qatar would likely further delegitimize the PLO as a future peace partner. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4125.22s)]
*  How can the PA help incentivize the moderation of more extremist Palestinian factions? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4129.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4134.9400000000005s)]
*  I'll answer this question. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4135.9400000000005s)]
*  Can I add just like one sentence? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4136.9400000000005s)]
*  Please, please. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4137.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4138.9400000000005s)]
*  I tell you something else we should avoid. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4139.9400000000005s)]
*  That's one sentence. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4142.3s)]
*  That's introduction to the other sentence. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4143.3s)]
*  We should avoid falling in the trap of thinking just because the idea of a Palestinian state [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4147.9400000000005s)]
*  on the territory Israel occupied in 1967 did not work imparts automaticity to the emergence [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4154.42s)]
*  of one state. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4160.860000000001s)]
*  That just, you know, it's a recipe for inaction. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4161.860000000001s)]
*  So to just wait it out, all we have to do is just wait it out. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4166.26s)]
*  There will be a state that just not going to happen. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4169.740000000001s)]
*  So we should avoid thinking those terms as well. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4172.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4174.58s)]
*  Now on the question of expanding the PLO and that the possibility that actually might include [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4175.58s)]
*  Hamas and everyone imparting legitimacy to them while at the same time rendering the [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4182.179999999999s)]
*  PLO less than an acceptable partner in a peace process to Israel. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4188.299999999999s)]
*  The idea that I actually propose specifically says that neither side would impose its conditions [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4195.38s)]
*  on the other side within the PLO. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4201.94s)]
*  In other words, the expanded PLO. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4203.46s)]
*  My idea is basically as it stands right now, the PLO cannot continue to say the only way [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4205.98s)]
*  you can get in is by changing your platform to conform to mine. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4212.339999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, it is not accepting of Hamas, Jihad or others to say unless you [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4217.299999999999s)]
*  change your platform, we will not join in. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4222.44s)]
*  Basically what this is, is a table that's large enough to accommodate everybody regardless [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4225.259999999999s)]
*  of their own individual factional political programs. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4230.86s)]
*  As a matter of fact, this is more or less the case within the PLO as it exists right [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4238.139999999999s)]
*  now. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4242.66s)]
*  It consists of factions and not all their programs are identical. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4243.66s)]
*  PFLP's program, for example, it's a member of PLO, is not identical to that of Fatah. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4247.7s)]
*  Fatah's own platform is not consistent with the PLO's platform, by the way. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4253.82s)]
*  So this is something that can be accommodated. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4260.22s)]
*  This is part of what I had meant when I said we need to find a way to effectively manage [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4262.58s)]
*  that pluralism. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4267.34s)]
*  But the idea of trying to manage by exclusion is I think definitely short-sighted and it [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4268.740000000001s)]
*  cannot really lead us anywhere. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4274.780000000001s)]
*  We need to bring everybody and there are some specific ideas as to how you can run that [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4277.22s)]
*  show notwithstanding the differing views. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4282.860000000001s)]
*  And why is that? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4286.34s)]
*  This is not really academic. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4287.34s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4288.84s)]
*  Because there is no solution in the immediate future. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4290.2s)]
*  If in fact the solution concept is being dangled as a possibility within the next year or [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4292.679999999999s)]
*  two, I'd say, okay, it's time for us Palestinians to make up our minds. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4299.76s)]
*  Are we going to go right or left? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4304.44s)]
*  But is there anybody in this room who thinks that that's realistic? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4306.76s)]
*  To the extent it's not realistic, I say why is it that we should continue to be divided [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4312.16s)]
*  over something that's not around the corner? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4317.2s)]
*  So let us really at least agree on an agenda that is about self-empowerment. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4319.54s)]
*  Build our own institutions, strengthen them, provide for the welfare of our people in the [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4327.8s)]
*  most competent way that we possibly can. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4332.72s)]
*  Build the reality of that state. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4335.96s)]
*  Project the reality of the state that we want regardless of our differences as to vision [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4337.88s)]
*  for an ultimate solution or a solution that might ultimately be accepted. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4343.0s)]
*  In the process, some transformation could occur. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4347.62s)]
*  At some point during the process, maybe a solution could become more realistic. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4350.96s)]
*  If and when it does, at that point, the leadership must say which way is it going to be? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4356.28s)]
*  Are we going to go this way or that way? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4362.0s)]
*  Maybe we can go to a referendum. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4364.12s)]
*  The idea of really wanting to ensure that all stars are aligned properly and ideally [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4366.5s)]
*  before we embark on a process transformation is wrong. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4372.5199999999995s)]
*  I think we should get on with it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4376.18s)]
*  We need to at least minimally commit everyone to one thing that is essential. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4377.78s)]
*  Nonviolence. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4383.18s)]
*  There is a condition. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4384.18s)]
*  So it's not like everybody gets in there with their own ideology and all of that. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4386.0199999999995s)]
*  Everybody has to commit under this scenario to nonviolence during this transition. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4389.66s)]
*  Everybody has to agree to it and it's going to be comprehensive, it's going to be everywhere, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4395.26s)]
*  not only in and around Gaza. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4398.74s)]
*  Everybody stands to benefit from this for sure. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4400.74s)]
*  And that certainly beats not doing anything. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4403.22s)]
*  You're giving me the idea that Hamas would not be asked to give up on its commitment [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4405.6s)]
*  to armed struggle. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4410.92s)]
*  It's just you're saying to be part of this pact, they would have to give up on it temporarily. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4413.76s)]
*  Is that realistic? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4419.8s)]
*  It's a time-bound commitment to nonviolence. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4420.8s)]
*  It's hoodna in Arabic. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4424.48s)]
*  It's time-bound commitment to nonviolence. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4427.08s)]
*  It is a truce. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4429.6s)]
*  It's something that actually is within what they actually exercise in practice effectively [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4430.6s)]
*  in previous years. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4436.5s)]
*  And it's doable. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4437.5s)]
*  Look, I go for what can be done. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4438.5s)]
*  The ideals and the maximalist positions that everybody has is one thing. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4441.26s)]
*  You need to understand, be aware of those. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4445.58s)]
*  But you ask yourself the question, this is about what is doable. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4447.660000000001s)]
*  This is the most we can accomplish. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4452.34s)]
*  It's better than continuing to go to war. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4453.54s)]
*  It certainly beats the destruction and misery that people are going through. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4457.14s)]
*  Why not do that? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4461.06s)]
*  There may be a way out, but that way out is not going to be perfectly engineered. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4462.26s)]
*  And the answer from now is all starts aligned completely perfectly. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4467.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, we'll take a question here from Farah Kalach. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4471.700000000001s)]
*  And then you'll raise your hand. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4475.9400000000005s)]
*  I will call on you. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4478.52s)]
*  You'll ask a succinct and potent question. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4479.52s)]
*  But first, Farah, please. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4482.0s)]
*  My question is, do you think that a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is feasible [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4487.14s)]
*  given a potential peace accord between Saudi Arabia and Israel? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4503.38s)]
*  Can you repeat the question? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4508.34s)]
*  I'll repeat it because I'm loud. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4510.1s)]
*  It's a great question. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4511.740000000001s)]
*  The question is basically, Israel and Saudi Arabia are talking about normalizing with [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4512.74s)]
*  the U.S. playing a very prominent role in that. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4518.74s)]
*  What would be the impact of that normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia for the prospects [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4522.78s)]
*  of Palestinian statehood? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4528.139999999999s)]
*  Very good question, actually. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4529.94s)]
*  And it was asked when the process of normalization started, beginning with countries that normalized [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4533.099999999999s)]
*  before Saudi Arabia. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4539.179999999999s)]
*  It was in the process. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4540.6s)]
*  That conversation was going on and then we know what happened. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4541.8s)]
*  I would have answered maybe differently at the start of normalization. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4547.52s)]
*  My preference for sure would have been for us to stick to the original API concept as [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4551.8s)]
*  it was. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4559.200000000001s)]
*  Arab Peace Initiative? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4560.200000000001s)]
*  API, did I say? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4561.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Arab Peace Initiative. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4562.200000000001s)]
*  That's what I meant, as it was. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4563.200000000001s)]
*  Because the normalization in a way can return that upside down. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4565.96s)]
*  But then I'm real, it's happened. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4570.400000000001s)]
*  So then you ask yourself, you prefer for the Arab Peace Initiative to be the basis for [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4572.52s)]
*  engagement in normalization. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4579.12s)]
*  That was normalization in exchange for Israeli recognition of Palestinian statehood. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4580.92s)]
*  That was the whole idea. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4585.88s)]
*  Originally Saudi proposal turned into something that's agreed by all Arab countries in the [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4586.88s)]
*  spring of 2002, Arab Summit and all. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4594.4800000000005s)]
*  At the same time, I have to tell you that that thing was on the table for a very long [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4597.98s)]
*  period of time, for nearly 20 years, and produced nothing. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4603.26s)]
*  Too bad it didn't. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4607.9s)]
*  It should have, but it didn't. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4608.9s)]
*  I was thinking maybe something could have been done to turn that concept that is embodied [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4611.5s)]
*  in the Arab Peace Initiative into a program of action. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4618.54s)]
*  Meaning we do this, you do that. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4621.78s)]
*  Turn it from a simple withdrawal and occupation normalization into a program. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4624.7s)]
*  Just do something with it, because it was sitting there and did nothing. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4631.0s)]
*  So I think it would be, I would not be completely honest if I told you that I was happy with [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4634.639999999999s)]
*  the state of affairs as it predated normalization. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4642.44s)]
*  We didn't get much of it. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4645.24s)]
*  But in any event, we are in the day after. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4647.44s)]
*  We are post-normalization, started to happen. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4650.24s)]
*  Clearly Saudi Arabia is a very significant country, and from Israel's point of view, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4653.14s)]
*  it's substantial. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4657.14s)]
*  And with that, possibly the payoff that could come with that on the part of what, in terms [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4658.14s)]
*  of thinking, what Israel may need to think about or consider on the Palestinian front [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4665.18s)]
*  to make the normalization deal possible politically and all of that productive. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4671.700000000001s)]
*  That's constructive. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4678.06s)]
*  I think this gives us something to talk about as a matter of fact. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4680.14s)]
*  But it actually puts especially a burden on us Palestinians to come up with a plan, a [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4684.34s)]
*  concept as to what it is we expect. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4690.74s)]
*  There are certain ideas that were put forward in general terms. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4693.62s)]
*  For example, an assured path to statehood. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4699.78s)]
*  Now define that. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4702.82s)]
*  I mean it sounds like a good something. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4703.82s)]
*  An assured path to statehood. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4706.0199999999995s)]
*  So we need to go a little bit beyond something like this. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4708.26s)]
*  Some ideas about, for example, oh, we recognize the state of Palestine. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4712.320000000001s)]
*  If there is recognition of the state of Palestine, then maybe Saudi Arabia could find it easier [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4716.8s)]
*  for it to engage or consummate a normalized relationship with Israel. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4721.2s)]
*  We need to be careful with these things. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4727.56s)]
*  What does it really actually mean? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4729.96s)]
*  We have some 150 countries already maybe recognizing the state of Palestine, which is fiction. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4731.8s)]
*  It's political fiction. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4740.24s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4741.24s)]
*  What is it we're really talking about? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4742.24s)]
*  Can we as a matter of fact turn this into something that's more meaningful? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4744.52s)]
*  Beginning with a statement of recognition of our right to a state, for example. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4750.0s)]
*  If there is a Palestinian initiative that begins to really actually put some elements [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4754.76s)]
*  together as to what might constitute a reasonable and realistic way forward and have that conversation [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4762.16s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia, I think Saudi Arabia is quite open to embracing a position like this, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4768.68s)]
*  taking it to the table with Israel. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4776.12s)]
*  I'm all for being specific and constructive about this as opposed to either formalistic [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4777.400000000001s)]
*  and saying, oh, whatever the Palestinians agree with, agree with. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4784.68s)]
*  To me, that honestly is not good enough. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4788.8s)]
*  On the other hand, for us Palestinians to say that's turning things on their head and [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4793.08s)]
*  it's not really a good idea and should be rejected and all of that sort of thing. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4797.92s)]
*  The train has left the station on that. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4801.88s)]
*  The question is what do you do to take advantage? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4803.76s)]
*  I think what we do, first of all, we really need to ourselves basically sketch a way forward [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4806.0s)]
*  for us that we all can converge on, have a conversation about that with Arab countries [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4813.08s)]
*  that have been actively interested in the Palestinian fight, talk about Jordan, Egypt, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4818.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, some other countries, include others, and then take that position to the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4824.28s)]
*  Arab League and have that become the new pan-Arab initiative for projecting the Palestinian [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4830.24s)]
*  interests and representing the Palestinian cause internationally, including on issues [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4837.24s)]
*  of normalization. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4841.599999999999s)]
*  Something like this I think would be an opportunity. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4842.84s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying that the normalizations that took place in the Trump administration, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4845.24s)]
*  those may have been appropriately seen as vehicles that led to the, for the bypassing [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4850.24s)]
*  of the Palestinian cause of self-determination, but the Saudi-Israeli normalization may have [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4856.24s)]
*  actually been a vehicle for putting it back on the table. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4863.24s)]
*  There's also something else. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4870.24s)]
*  There is that, but there's also something else. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4872.0s)]
*  I'm going to call questions. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4875.0s)]
*  Very quickly, there's also something else on this. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4876.0s)]
*  Before the normalization that took place during the Trump administration, Israel was only [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4878.2s)]
*  presented or was looking at the promise of what could happen if it were to withdraw from [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4883.84s)]
*  territory that occupied in 1967, Arab territory, not only Palestinian. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4889.8s)]
*  The promise of what might come out of that, things change. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4894.8s)]
*  When things change, there is no dynamic now. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4900.6s)]
*  Israel is looking today at something different or was up until October 7 looking at something [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4903.240000000001s)]
*  different. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4907.8s)]
*  I'm not saying that's not going to be recreated, but it was looking at something different. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4908.8s)]
*  And now post October 7, still the picture has changed. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4914.8s)]
*  Israel is now looking at normalization that it has pocketed and normalization that it [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4918.8s)]
*  actually would like to have. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4925.2s)]
*  So, something that it has secured, something that it wishes to have. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4926.92s)]
*  How secure is what it has secured? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4933.2s)]
*  How likely is it going to be possible for that to be secure or for Israel to feel secure [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4938.12s)]
*  enough about that being permanent something? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4944.64s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4947.64s)]
*  I know how countries that have normalized the question, what Israel would say, would [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4949.12s)]
*  answer that question. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4955.160000000001s)]
*  But regardless of how they themselves would answer the question, is that kind of relationship [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4956.8s)]
*  resilient enough to continue to withstand the political pressure and the mobilization [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4964.280000000001s)]
*  that's associated with the continued carnage, death, destruction at the massive scale that's [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4971.12s)]
*  going on in Gaza, for how much longer is that going to really be the case? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4977.72s)]
*  This is countries that, and I have not included at least or implied enough about other countries. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4981.64s)]
*  We talk about countries that normalize under Trump administration, but there are two Arab [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4989.76s)]
*  countries that have peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4994.5599999999995s)]
*  There are other countries. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=4999.28s)]
*  So, there are regional ramifications to what's going on and all the more reason for there [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5000.719999999999s)]
*  to be much more preoccupation on the need and the importance, vital importance of bringing [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5006.24s)]
*  this war to an end sooner rather than later. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5012.16s)]
*  Okay, let's take some questions. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5014.679999999999s)]
*  So hold on, keep your hand up. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5016.96s)]
*  So I'll start with Professor Najih Hajj, but keep your hand up just so I can, okay, go ahead please. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5019.44s)]
*  We have a mic coming to you. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5025.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5027.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5030.0s)]
*  I had a question about your vision of the Palestinian future and post-Oslo, I feel that [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5031.240000000001s)]
*  the Palestinian communities in the Mokhayyams in Lebanon, in Syria, and Jordan have been [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5040.56s)]
*  forgotten as someone that professionally studies the region and my family lives in Nahd al-Badid [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5048.52s)]
*  and most of these camps in Lebanon and Jordan and other places. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5056.36s)]
*  The resounding phrase I hear is, we live without hope. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5060.48s)]
*  And I wonder what is the hope, what is the amal here for all these, the vast majority [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5069.16s)]
*  of Palestinians live outside of the West Bank and Gaza. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5074.28s)]
*  What's the vision for them at this table of a future Palestinian state? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5081.12s)]
*  Great question. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5086.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5087.84s)]
*  There are two dimensions to this. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5088.84s)]
*  First you made the reference to Oslo and what was agreed in Oslo and what was agreed in [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5093.76s)]
*  Oslo was to have this issue settled in negotiations. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5098.48s)]
*  The issue of right of return for refugees? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5102.28s)]
*  No, not right of return, the issue of refugees. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5104.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5106.88s)]
*  That's the distinction I wanted to really make here. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5107.88s)]
*  So that was something that was supposed to be resolved in negotiations. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5110.56s)]
*  The issue was negotiated definitely extensively. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5114.160000000001s)]
*  It was not there when it happened in the course of the negotiations, certainly during the [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5119.04s)]
*  90s and even after that. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5126.64s)]
*  But that was discussed as arrangements, how many are going to return, not return, compensation, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5129.8s)]
*  was that kind of discussion. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5136.6s)]
*  What is really important to understand is, and that's really part of weakness, that's [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5139.12s)]
*  when I made the reference to Edward Said for example, Oslo did not address the issue of [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5144.24s)]
*  Palestinian national rights at all. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5149.52s)]
*  You ask me and you would be right to react to any Palestinian leader in position of power [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5151.36s)]
*  and authority. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5158.16s)]
*  It's a fair question to ask. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5159.16s)]
*  What is their definition when we say our national rights, national rights provided for under [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5160.96s)]
*  international law? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5166.16s)]
*  Let me tell you how I define them. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5167.36s)]
*  I begin with the right of return as provided for under international law, specifically [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5170.88s)]
*  UN General Assembly Resolution 194. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5176.68s)]
*  I count that as number one, right of return, because that's the essence of what the Palestinian [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5180.36s)]
*  cause is about. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5185.16s)]
*  That's all. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5186.16s)]
*  Right of return, right to self-determination, including the right to a fully sovereign state [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5187.16s)]
*  on the territory of Israel occupied in 1967 in its entirety, including Jerusalem. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5195.52s)]
*  That's how I do it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5201.4400000000005s)]
*  But I start with that. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5202.4400000000005s)]
*  So as a right of our people, I don't think we should really ever give up on that, nor [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5204.4400000000005s)]
*  should we expect it to. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5211.040000000001s)]
*  And by the way, this is language that is included in something that Mahmoud Darwish, Mahmoud [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5213.4800000000005s)]
*  Darwish is known as a poet, but he's a foremost political thinker. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5220.72s)]
*  He actually on the 50th anniversary of Nakbar wrote a most profound, politically speaking, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5225.24s)]
*  peace message from Palestinian people. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5233.2s)]
*  And he concluded by saying something to the effect that there will be peace. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5238.88s)]
*  Until Israelis grow up and recognize our national rights as a people, and he counted them, and [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5245.84s)]
*  Then he close by saying, there can be no peace with the occupation, and there can be [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5269.2s)]
*  no peace between masters and slaves. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5278.4s)]
*  I said, I translated to kind of make it easier for the Western ear, there can be no peace [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5281.96s)]
*  between masters and surrogates. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5291.24s)]
*  I think fundamentally, what is really required is a recalibration where humaneness and humanity [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5295.4s)]
*  of Palestinians is recognized on par with everyone else. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5303.44s)]
*  When our pain and suffering is so recognized as equal to the pain and suffering of any [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5308.24s)]
*  other people anywhere around the world. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5312.54s)]
*  When we will get to the point when that is the case, I think peace will be within reach. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5315.4s)]
*  And just as we would like to be seen that way and dealt with this way, we should also [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5320.68s)]
*  be of the mindset to actually accept that as a vision for all peoples around us and [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5326.56s)]
*  around the world. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5336.12s)]
*  That's just the way it has to be. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5337.12s)]
*  The suffering of others. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5339.280000000001s)]
*  That's just how it goes. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5341.4800000000005s)]
*  We should not really be always kind of put to the task of having to somehow prove that [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5342.96s)]
*  we are worthy of this, that or the other thing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5347.64s)]
*  But you know, the struggle for that starts with us. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5350.6s)]
*  We definitely should insist on parity. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5357.4800000000005s)]
*  Parity is absolutely important. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5360.64s)]
*  When we really get to that point, I think other issues begin to really find the resources. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5361.64s)]
*  That will take time. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5366.56s)]
*  But that would take a lot of energy, determination, and will and leadership on our part first [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5368.320000000001s)]
*  and foremost. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5375.320000000001s)]
*  So we're running out of time, but I want to try to take two more questions. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5376.88s)]
*  Can I just get them to ask them one after the other? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5380.64s)]
*  And then you can. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5383.12s)]
*  So I'll come to Ahmed and then Adam. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5384.12s)]
*  Right here. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5388.24s)]
*  And ask it briefly and then I'm going to answer. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5390.64s)]
*  Just a quick point on the Singapore talking point. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5393.96s)]
*  I think on the question of hope that is really important, I think like Dr. Fayyad said, despite [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5397.76s)]
*  occupation and despite the siege, Gaza and the West Bank have higher literacy rates than [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5402.96s)]
*  Singapore. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5408.16s)]
*  So that's one. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5409.16s)]
*  But I think my question is, I think we've seen the staunch position that the US has [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5410.16s)]
*  taken in the conference, 6th of October 7th. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5415.12s)]
*  If we do enter negotiations with Israelis, who should be the mediator and who should [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5418.52s)]
*  help lead these talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5423.76s)]
*  Excellent. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5427.0s)]
*  By the way, also higher literacy rate than my home country of Egypt. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5428.0s)]
*  Yes, Adam. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5431.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5432.719999999999s)]
*  My name is Adam Satterfeld. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5436.32s)]
*  I'm a master's student. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5437.32s)]
*  My question is about international aid and how that aid is distributed. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5438.32s)]
*  So the Palestinian Authority receives a massive amount of international aid as a part of its [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5442.24s)]
*  economy. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5447.04s)]
*  There's been persistent allegations that that aid has been misappropriated or misused. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5448.04s)]
*  And so I'm curious as both the finance minister, former finance minister and prime minister, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5452.28s)]
*  can you speak to those allegations? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5456.28s)]
*  And if those are not accurate, can you talk about some of the checks and balances that [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5457.639999999999s)]
*  are in place to ensure that doesn't occur? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5461.88s)]
*  So two questions. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5463.92s)]
*  One, who should mediate this, you know, any kind of final settlement or interim settlement [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5464.92s)]
*  between the Israelis and the Palestinians? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5472.84s)]
*  And the other one is really about corruption that you're saying, you know, we, you know, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5474.54s)]
*  Palestinians should self-govern. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5479.360000000001s)]
*  He's saying, well, there's been a long record of corruption of people feathering their nests. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5480.360000000001s)]
*  Indeed, that might be what some of these factual rivalries are about, about the opportunity [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5485.200000000001s)]
*  to feather nets. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5489.0s)]
*  How do we overcome that problem? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5490.0s)]
*  First of all, I think in terms of history, we know how it happened. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5491.0s)]
*  There's involvement, generally speaking, by the international community. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5499.32s)]
*  But everybody understood that the key player in that was the United States and even other [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5502.76s)]
*  components of the international community, by the way, including Russia, for a good part [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5508.04s)]
*  of the period in the context of the Quartet, were deferring to the United States in many [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5511.92s)]
*  ways because they felt that the United States was in a unique position to influence the [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5517.639999999999s)]
*  way Israel behaves because ultimately Israel is supposed to give up territory, to see territory [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5520.84s)]
*  in order for there to be president state. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5528.48s)]
*  So the U.S. had that kind of a standing. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5530.679999999999s)]
*  It was seen as having it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5534.759999999999s)]
*  And its other partners in the international community were not unhappy with it because [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5537.08s)]
*  they themselves could not deliver. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5542.04s)]
*  For example, the U.S. could not get from Israel what the U.S. itself thinks the U.S. may be [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5543.72s)]
*  able to get from Israel. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5549.52s)]
*  So there is that reality. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5550.96s)]
*  So a legitimate question to ask is if the process failed, well, maybe given the nature [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5553.120000000001s)]
*  of the intermediation effort in terms of the players who is doing it, maybe it needs to [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5559.8s)]
*  be reconsidered. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5564.56s)]
*  And there is an argument for that. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5565.56s)]
*  We need to think about what that might mean. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5568.72s)]
*  Something broader than the Quartet, the world has changed in important ways. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5571.92s)]
*  The process has kind of really started before the world became effectively unipolar for [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5576.96s)]
*  about a decade and then started to shift away, kind of multipolarity. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5583.32s)]
*  So many things have changed. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5588.5599999999995s)]
*  So you expand what was a party of four or a group of four to a group of six, include [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5590.2s)]
*  other countries like, for example, China, like India and all. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5596.84s)]
*  But then you need a convener somehow. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5602.24s)]
*  And I think everybody could have something to do. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5605.2s)]
*  I think more important than who does the intermediation is maybe the framework within which this [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5607.04s)]
*  is to happen and the basis of the process. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5616.4800000000005s)]
*  I think what is really more important than who's going to really be the manager, orchestrator, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5620.84s)]
*  convener or mediator, the principles of it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5626.76s)]
*  Let's just really begin with clear definition of what the principles are. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5631.08s)]
*  Because where we could go wrong is when we begin to think that what ought to be principles [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5636.64s)]
*  are to be negotiated. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5643.92s)]
*  Negotiations ought not be about principles. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5644.92s)]
*  They should be about arrangements. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5648.320000000001s)]
*  They should be about assurances, but not principles. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5650.12s)]
*  An overriding principle from my point of view for us Palestinians is to have our national [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5653.08s)]
*  rights as a people recognized. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5659.5199999999995s)]
*  We are the people to be excluded, marginalized, canceled in this. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5662.08s)]
*  That's the nature of this enterprise from the very beginning. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5667.36s)]
*  So can we really begin this process by a clear and unequivocal statement of recognition by [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5671.6s)]
*  State of Israel of our national rights as a people? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5679.12s)]
*  That's very important to really get the process going. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5682.36s)]
*  And then less important is actually who does it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5686.08s)]
*  But I can see a process that could really benefit from broadening it somewhat. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5689.44s)]
*  But really I think it would be more important to focus on the substance of it and what goes [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5695.639999999999s)]
*  into it by way of the principles and deliverables. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5700.36s)]
*  On good governance, poor governance and misuse of funds and the rest of it. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5705.759999999999s)]
*  I am a firm believer in the need for that to be a focus of any government. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5711.4s)]
*  And some actually used to take issue with how obsessed I was with talking about good [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5718.32s)]
*  governance as if it's really a priority under occupation. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5722.92s)]
*  I say it's a priority everywhere and especially so, particularly when it becomes a part of [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5725.799999999999s)]
*  what you're expected to do and overcome if it's poor governance in order to somehow qualify [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5731.839999999999s)]
*  it becomes even a national duty. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5739.72s)]
*  If ours is about liberation and if even however unfairly we became expected to have to pass [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5741.76s)]
*  that test to qualify for statehood, however unfairly, I think it would be stupid of us [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5749.4400000000005s)]
*  not to really take that test and pass it to begin with. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5755.400000000001s)]
*  Now clearly that is not where we are. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5758.280000000001s)]
*  It's clearly that's not where we need to be either. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5761.88s)]
*  But it's something that we should call the highest priority too. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5765.96s)]
*  Where I think the word sometimes goes wrong and is kind of really embedded and saying [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5769.72s)]
*  things like Singapore and why is it that we didn't become that as opposed to who we are [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5775.72s)]
*  today and all of that sort of thing. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5781.08s)]
*  The idea is we're too corrupt to manage, we're too corrupt to become a state, we're too corrupt [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5783.0s)]
*  to be the drivers of our own fate and shapers of our own destiny and all of that sort of thing. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5789.96s)]
*  If that's ever going to be a criterion, I can give you a very long list of countries [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5797.96s)]
*  that would immediately qualify for occupation. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5804.6s)]
*  Alright, Dr. Salem, thank you. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5810.36s)]
*  There's two things I want to say. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5813.32s)]
*  The first is I said that to the extent I have a strong religious identity as a Fayadist [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5814.72s)]
*  and I suspect that at the end of this 90 minutes more than a few people have been converted to the faith. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5820.320000000001s)]
*  So welcome. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5826.320000000001s)]
*  The second thing I want to say is, you know, people at Harvard often talk about how extraordinarily privileged we are. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5829.04s)]
*  And I think, you know, what we've seen today is that that privilege is not the beautiful buildings [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5835.280000000001s)]
*  or the amazing food or the tremendous professors. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5842.72s)]
*  By the way, I was just being totally sarcastic about all of those. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5846.72s)]
*  But it's really about opportunities like this one. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5850.400000000001s)]
*  The opportunity that we just had to be in communion with a mind that I think is not just a national treasure [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5853.6s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, but in fact is a global treasure. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5859.6s)]
*  So please everybody join me in thanking Dr. Salem. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5863.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5866.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5870.320000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adADEkF-zE&t=5872.72s)]
