# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with Mouin Rabbani
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o)
*  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Settle down. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=6.96s)]
*  I know everybody's excited. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=7.96s)]
*  My name is Tariq Massoud. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=9.84s)]
*  I'm the Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Governance here at the Harvard Kennedy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=11.68s)]
*  School and I'm the Faculty Director of the Middle East Initiative and it's my great pleasure [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=16.04s)]
*  to welcome you to tonight's, I think this is the 10th installment in our series of Middle [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  East Dialogues, which are a series of conversations that we're having with very bright and gifted [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=29.4s)]
*  people who have important perspectives on the conflict in Israel and Palestine and the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=36.4s)]
*  ways out of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=43.0s)]
*  Our guest today is Moeen Rabbani and he's perhaps one of the most eloquent exponents [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  of what I might call, for lack of a more artful description, as an exponent of an authentically [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=51.84s)]
*  and unapologetically Palestinian perspective on the conflict, its causes and the way forward. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=61.28s)]
*  Mr. Rabbani is a Dutch Palestinian political analyst who's currently a fellow at the Middle [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=69.56s)]
*  on global affairs based in Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=77.12s)]
*  And he's the co-editor of Jedaliya, which I'm sure many of you know is an electronic [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=80.72s)]
*  magazine published by the Arab Studies Institute that covers the Arab world with, I think it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=86.28s)]
*  fair to say, a very strong analytic perspective, highly influenced by critical theory, which [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=92.32s)]
*  is to say the kind of place that would never publish me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=99.16s)]
*  He is also, he's got a long and glittering CV, but one of the positions he held was as [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=103.16s)]
*  political affairs officer with the Office of the UN Special Envoy of the Secretary General [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=110.64s)]
*  for Syria. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Rabbani and I will speak for about 45 minutes before we open the floor to you for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=118.84s)]
*  your questions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  And I want to note that the event is being recorded and it will be posted eventually [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  on the internet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=131.24s)]
*  So if you do ask a question, you are thereby consenting to being memorialized for all time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=132.36s)]
*  In fact, your question may be the most important thing that emerges from this event. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=139.28s)]
*  So I want you all to join me in welcoming to Harvard, Maeen Rabbani. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=145.18s)]
*  So welcome, Maeen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=154.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=155.5s)]
*  Thank you very much for the invitation to be here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=159.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=161.24s)]
*  So, Mareen, I want our conversation to focus on two broad areas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=163.12s)]
*  First, I do want your take on what's happening right now with respect to the conflict, what's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=166.12s)]
*  happening with the ceasefire negotiations, the Arab peace plan that was proposed in Cairo [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=173.96s)]
*  last week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=180.08s)]
*  And then, and maybe I would also like to get your general read on the Trump administration's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=182.4s)]
*  approach to the conflict. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=186.28s)]
*  But then I'd also like us to zoom out and probe your broader view of the conflict and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=187.48s)]
*  its causes and whether it can be resolved. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=193.96s)]
*  But before we get to that, one thing that I've been doing, particularly with our interlocutors [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=197.56s)]
*  from Palestine or Israel, is to try to remind our audience that the people that we're speaking [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=202.74s)]
*  with are not just disembodied minds who have analytic perspectives on the conflict, but [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=210.12s)]
*  people who are deeply rooted in the place that we are talking about. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  And Mareen, you are obviously a Palestinian. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=221.12s)]
*  You have family and friends in Palestine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  And so I want to ask you the same question that I asked Sippy Livni earlier this semester. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=227.72s)]
*  How are your family and loved ones? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  How are they coping with this moment? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's obviously been a very traumatic year and a half. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=235.92s)]
*  I have family indeed throughout the Middle East, in Palestine, in Lebanon, in Syria, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=241.08s)]
*  in Jordan, in the Gulf, and also in Germany, which presents challenges of its own, and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=247.96s)]
*  in Europe and in North America. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  And on the whole, I would say, it's been a particularly traumatic 18 years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=258.6s)]
*  I mean, Palestine has, since the Nakba, it's now been 75 years, but I think what's changed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=265.32s)]
*  now is that it's open, unapologetic genocide that is being committed against the Palestinian [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=273.44s)]
*  people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=281.8s)]
*  It's taken it to an entirely new level. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=282.8s)]
*  And I think this will remain with not only my family, but for that matter, the Palestinian [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  people as a whole for generations to come, not unlike the Armenians, not unlike the Bosnians, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=293.64s)]
*  not unlike, indeed, the Jews of Europe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=300.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=303.24s)]
*  Well, we will definitely come back to this very contentious point about what we call [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=304.24s)]
*  what's happening right now in Palestine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=308.44s)]
*  But let's first just dive into the state of play. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=311.52s)]
*  And I guess maybe I'll start by asking you on your read about the Trump administration [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=314.32s)]
*  and how it's handling this conflict. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=319.84s)]
*  So I know a lot of Arab Americans who voted for President Trump because they thought that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=322.64s)]
*  he would be better than Biden. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=328.08s)]
*  In their view, Biden just gave a blank check to Benjamin Netanyahu in terms of his conduct [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=330.28s)]
*  of this war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=335.84s)]
*  And people thought Trump is going to absolutely be better than that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=337.08s)]
*  But then the president comes into office and we hear him say things like the US is going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=340.46s)]
*  to own Gaza, clear it out, turn it into an international playground and give the Palestinians [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=345.2s)]
*  alternate housing somewhere else, Egypt, Jordan, who knows. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=351.32s)]
*  And that alternate housing is going to be so good that they're never going to want to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=354.84s)]
*  go back to their homeland. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=357.64s)]
*  So is this administration bad for the Palestinians? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, let me first take issue with the premise of your question. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=362.2s)]
*  I think for many Arab Americans, it was not so much a question of supporting Trump as [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  being unable morally to vote for Biden, even though many of them were natural constituents [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=380.64s)]
*  And what I think happened last year is that the Harris campaign almost went out of its [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  way to make a public show of contempt for these voters on the assumption that it was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=389.32s)]
*  a winning strategy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=395.56s)]
*  And of course, she lost for multiple reasons. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=396.56s)]
*  But by basically scorning what's known as the anti-genocide vote, which was, of course, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=400.64s)]
*  much broader than just Arab Americans or for that matter, Muslim Americans, she helped [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=406.0s)]
*  seal her own fate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=412.76s)]
*  Now, as far as President Trump is concerned, I always preface any remarks I make about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=414.28s)]
*  him by noting that we're dealing with a very erratic, impulsive and unpredictable leader, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=421.32s)]
*  which makes informed speculation quite hazardous. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=431.76s)]
*  Because in a manner of speaking, we could wake up tomorrow morning and anything in its [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=437.48s)]
*  opposite are equally plausible. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=442.08s)]
*  But getting to the specifics of your question, I would say we should, more than with others, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  we should focus more on what he does and less on what he says. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=450.2s)]
*  Because a relationship between actions and words is often not there to be made. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=456.04s)]
*  So we have Trump, to his credit, and in very sharp contrast with the Biden administration, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  actually did not accept Israel indefinitely continuing its genocidal military campaign [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and increasingly in the West Bank as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  And he compelled the Israeli government to accept the ceasefire proposal that was on [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=483.44s)]
*  the table. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=490.2s)]
*  Now, of course, he's making statements that make any agreement irrelevant, because what's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=491.2s)]
*  the point of having an agreement if your intention is to forcibly displace every last Palestinian [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=497.48s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=504.04s)]
*  But that's rhetorical. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=505.44s)]
*  I would focus much more on what this administration is doing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=507.08s)]
*  My reading of it is that it seems more specifically focused on American interests than its predecessor. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Is that good for Palestinians? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=520.64s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=523.92s)]
*  But in principle, someone who is less willing to defer to Israeli leadership than Biden [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=525.86s)]
*  was, who I think, again, is without precedent. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  Every time an American leader leaves office, at least since the late 1960s, the Israeli [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=540.34s)]
*  government also always bids him farewell by saying, this is the best friend Israel has [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=546.94s)]
*  ever had in the White House. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=551.96s)]
*  And that's always been true. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  But after Biden, I think he's set such a high bar that I think even a second Trump administration [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  will have difficulty exceeding what Biden contributed to Israel. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=562.34s)]
*  It's a really, really surprising perspective from you, Maureen, because this is the administration [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=568.9s)]
*  that in its first term moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognized the annexation of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=576.0s)]
*  the Golan, and I know that's Syrian land, not Palestinian, but nonetheless speaks to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=581.18s)]
*  a kind of willingness to cut Netanyahu a blank check. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=585.62s)]
*  And then just last week, the Arab countries get together and propose an alternative plan [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=590.18s)]
*  to the one that President Trump had offered. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=596.0s)]
*  And this alternative plan involves pumping billions into Gaza, appointing a technocratic [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  government that's not going to have Hamas in it, having elections in a year. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=603.64s)]
*  And what does the American administration do? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  The American administration, joining with the Netanyahu administration, rejects it totally. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=609.76s)]
*  And so doesn't that suggest that the Trump administration has signed on to Netanyahu's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=614.56s)]
*  view of this, which is that Gaza is going to continue to be an irritant until it is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  cleared of Palestinians? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=625.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, I wouldn't call it a plan. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=627.16s)]
*  It's more a proposal or even a rhetorical statement. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=629.9s)]
*  I haven't seen anything that that would justify calling it an actual plan. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  Second of all, if I can just return to the premise of your question again. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=640.52s)]
*  Yes, all those things that Trump did during his first term, you're entirely correct. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=644.92s)]
*  But the idea that he somehow changed traditional U.S. policy and stood it on its head, I think [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=652.32s)]
*  there's very little evidence for that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=659.0s)]
*  I think we should look for continuity as much as change. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=661.0s)]
*  And if you look at the main initiatives that Trump took during his first term, many of [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=665.4s)]
*  them were in fact the logical culmination of decades of U.S. policy. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=670.88s)]
*  Take for example moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=676.32s)]
*  Well, all Trump did is he stopped signing waivers for congressional legislation that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=681.24s)]
*  had been passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority decades earlier. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=687.36s)]
*  The closure of the PLO mission to Washington, same thing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=693.76s)]
*  Congress, with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in 1987, passed the Grassley bill, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=698.16s)]
*  I think it was called, designating the PLO as a terrorist organization. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=704.48s)]
*  And the only reason it was able to operate in Washington is because the president signed [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  a waiver every six months allowing this mission to continue operating. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=714.92s)]
*  All Trump did is not sign a waiver. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=719.16s)]
*  So is that a radical break or is it logical culmination of decades of U.S. policy? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=722.12s)]
*  Now, I would argue there is a stronger case to be made for logical culmination than a [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=727.68s)]
*  radical break. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=734.52s)]
*  As far as, again, regarding this whole harebrained scheme of a Gaza Riviera, it's still born. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=736.24s)]
*  It's dead in the water. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=744.2s)]
*  It's never going to be implemented. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=745.4000000000001s)]
*  And again, we should focus on what Trump is actually doing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  Will Trump continue with the ceasefire proposal? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=754.6s)]
*  Will the United States force Israel to proceed to the second stage of the January agreement? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=760.04s)]
*  Or will Trump allow the Netanyahu government to derail this agreement and to resume its [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  genocidal military campaign? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=775.76s)]
*  I think the jury is still out of that because we're seeing contradictory developments. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=777.92s)]
*  On the one hand, the U.S. engaged in a direct dialogue with Hamas. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=783.44s)]
*  Witkoff was in the region again. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=791.6400000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, according to Israel, the United States has also put forward a proposal [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=794.7600000000001s)]
*  to more or less indefinitely extend the first phase of the agreement so that it doesn't [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=801.34s)]
*  get to the second stage where there is a durable ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=813.36s)]
*  Again, I wouldn't make any definitive conclusions about where this is going, except to say, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=814.76s)]
*  and I'm no fan of this White House, but credit where it's due, Trump has gone in directions [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=825.48s)]
*  that Biden would never have contemplated. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=833.48s)]
*  So again, I'm surprised to hear you say that, but last year we had Jared Kushner here. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=837.28s)]
*  And in part of our conversation, we were talking about his negotiating strategy with the Palestinians [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=847.12s)]
*  versus his negotiating strategy with the Israelis. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  And I was saying to him, you were really giving the Israelis a lot and being very tough on [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=857.52s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=862.6s)]
*  And he said, and people can go back to the video and watch this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=863.6s)]
*  He said something like, well, the Israelis were the stronger party. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=866.52s)]
*  And that speaks to a kind of the logic by which this administration does deals. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=870.1999999999999s)]
*  And the Israelis right now are for sure the stronger party. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=875.92s)]
*  This is a country that, or Netanyahu administration, that has remade the entire Middle East. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=881.68s)]
*  Hamas, people say Hamas is an idea. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=888.64s)]
*  You can't kill an idea. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=891.72s)]
*  Well, Hamas has basically been reduced to just an idea at this stage. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, very much decimated. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=897.0s)]
*  Hezbollah decimated. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=899.48s)]
*  The Syrian regime collapsed and now Israel occupies a huge swath of Syria. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=901.88s)]
*  Iran is on the back foot. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=910.52s)]
*  This doesn't look like a country that would feel any need to compromise with the Palestinians. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=912.84s)]
*  And it doesn't look like a country that the Trump administration would pressure. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=920.16s)]
*  What am I getting wrong there? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think these movements and states that you mentioned, have they been [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=927.92s)]
*  significantly weakened? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=934.0799999999999s)]
*  They most definitely have. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=936.36s)]
*  Have they been eradicated or eliminated? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=938.1999999999999s)]
*  All the evidence suggests that they have not. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=941.0s)]
*  Secondly, are you going to look at this conflict in purely military terms? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=944.5999999999999s)]
*  If you do, then it's incontestable. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=952.1199999999999s)]
*  One party has an overwhelming advantage over all the others combined. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  But this is an issue with multiple dimensions, of which the military dimension is only one [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=961.64s)]
*  important dimension. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  There is the political dimension. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  There is the regional dimension. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=971.64s)]
*  There is the legal dimension. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=973.24s)]
*  And I think if you take all these together, Israel is not sitting quite as pretty as you [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  suggest. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=982.84s)]
*  Second of all, I think we should perhaps not exclusively focus on the US-Israeli relationship. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=983.84s)]
*  We should look also, for example, at the US-Saudi relationship, which I think will be central [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=992.24s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=999.08s)]
*  Will the Saudis use the influence they undoubtedly have in Washington to seek to push the Trump [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1001.36s)]
*  administration to adopt a different policy towards Palestine, even for purposes entirely [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  their own? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1016.6400000000001s)]
*  It's quite possible. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1017.96s)]
*  It's also possible that the Saudis will abandon this idea of a normalization agreement with [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1019.24s)]
*  focus exclusively on a bilateral agreement with Washington. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  And Trump may well go for that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1033.08s)]
*  And as a result, basically, let Israel continue to go its merry way with the Palestinians. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1035.4s)]
*  I think these are issues for which it's premature. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1040.88s)]
*  Again, we can attempt informed speculation, but I think it's premature to draw any definitive [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1045.44s)]
*  conclusions about where things are heading. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1052.72s)]
*  I think six months from now, we'll have a much better idea. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1054.92s)]
*  And as far as the Arab proposal that came out of the recent Arab League summit that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1059.0s)]
*  you mentioned, I don't think that's going to go very far. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1065.24s)]
*  They apparently pledged $53 billion. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1068.5600000000002s)]
*  If $5 billion gets actually dispersed, that would be a big success. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1071.52s)]
*  But I think what was important about that is not the details about money and governance [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1078.88s)]
*  and all that, but that you had the Arab governments, which have been inner spectators for a year [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1084.52s)]
*  and a half, watching the Palestinians get slaughtered on a daily basis within their [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1090.68s)]
*  own homeland, now realizing that there are proposals on the table to transform the question [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1096.04s)]
*  of Palestine from a political question that needs to be resolved with self-determination, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1105.24s)]
*  with decolonization, with statehood, into a humanitarian issue, as it was in the 50s [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1111.76s)]
*  and 60s, that is resolved with housing and jobs and social services. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1118.52s)]
*  Secondly, that the proposal would have exported to the Arab world. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1124.52s)]
*  In other words, the Arab states, individual and collectively, see this as a threat to [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1130.04s)]
*  their national security. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1136.56s)]
*  This being Trump's idea of expelling the Palestinians? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1137.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1140.84s)]
*  It would directly affect their national security. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1141.84s)]
*  No Arab leader is going to sign his political death warrant for the sake of better relations [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1145.0s)]
*  with Washington. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1149.76s)]
*  And they sent a very clear message of this stops here. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1151.36s)]
*  What are they going to do next? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1156.12s)]
*  I'm afraid not very much, but I think they have at least put a final stop to this proposal. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1157.8s)]
*  So I think that's probably right that the Arab countries have made very clear that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1166.68s)]
*  the proposal that President Trump floated is a non-starter and President Trump has since [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1172.72s)]
*  walked back from it, I think, in a press conference. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1177.72s)]
*  Walked back and forward and back. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  But you talked about the Trump administration potentially pursuing a different policy towards [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1183.0800000000002s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1190.08s)]
*  And that's a very big thing versus the Trump administration leaning on Netanyahu to get [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1191.56s)]
*  to phase two of this ceasefire deal. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1200.02s)]
*  And so what would have to happen or tell me the story by which the Trump administration [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1203.6399999999999s)]
*  adopts a fundamentally different policy towards the Palestinians, presumably a policy designed [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1212.3799999999999s)]
*  to hasten the day when Palestinians achieve self-determination, et cetera? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1218.1s)]
*  Well, again, this is purely speculative and admittedly prematurely speculative. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1223.58s)]
*  But difference between Trump and Biden. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1231.4199999999998s)]
*  Biden had a passionate ideological attachment to Israel. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1234.06s)]
*  I don't think anyone can question that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1237.6599999999999s)]
*  Trump at the end of the day doesn't give a hoot for Israel, Palestinians, anyone else. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1240.8999999999999s)]
*  He's purely concerned at most with the United States and arguably only with Trump, Inc. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1246.5s)]
*  If you look at what the Americans have been doing the past few weeks, they seem increasingly [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1255.34s)]
*  fixated on retrieving captives from the Gaza Strip who have dual U.S. citizenship. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1260.3s)]
*  And on that basis, they felt that Netanyahu is simply proving too big an obstacle to this [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1268.54s)]
*  process and they opened a direct dialogue with Hamas. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1276.18s)]
*  Again, speculating, suppose that the Americans now go back to the Saudis and propose this [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1280.6200000000001s)]
*  grand normalization deal, which is actually primarily a bilateral Saudi-U.S. treaty with [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1287.38s)]
*  normalization with Israel added on in order to push it through Congress. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1296.02s)]
*  Suppose that the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, says, you know, I can't do this [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1302.34s)]
*  without a Palestinian state. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1308.9s)]
*  Would Trump then say, no, I'm too committed to the Israelis to put any pressure on them? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1314.22s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1322.66s)]
*  But by the same token, suppose the Saudis go to the Americans and say, you know, the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1323.86s)]
*  Israelis are too far off the deep end. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1330.02s)]
*  There's no deal to be made with them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1331.9s)]
*  Let's just focus on Saudi-U.S. relations. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1334.1399999999999s)]
*  Were that to happen, then I can see Trump giving the Israelis a blank check to annex [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1338.54s)]
*  the West Bank and depopulate Gaza and the rest of it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1342.98s)]
*  So it's very much up in the air now. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1346.78s)]
*  The Saudis are very serious when they say a condition for normalization is a Palestinian [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1348.54s)]
*  state and why? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1354.06s)]
*  Well, Saudi has a very committed public opinion. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1355.82s)]
*  And I think, you know, there's this illusion that autocracies can safely ignore their own [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1364.4199999999998s)]
*  public opinion. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1371.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, if that was the case, no autocracy would ever get overthrown. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1372.8999999999999s)]
*  And the Saudis, I think, particularly since October 2023, will not move forward with a [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1379.66s)]
*  normalization with Israel unless they have clear commitments. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1388.46s)]
*  In other words, commitments that are much more clear than any offer to the Palestinians [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1395.1000000000001s)]
*  in the Oslo agreement of 1993, that there is going to be an irreversible end to the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1399.26s)]
*  occupation. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1407.14s)]
*  I think this idea that the Saudis could be bought off by giving the custodianship over [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  the Al Aqsa Mosque to them instead of Jordan, I think that's an illusion. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1414.5800000000002s)]
*  And again, you know, they could decide the price is too high. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1421.38s)]
*  The Americans could decide this is something they don't want to do. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1426.42s)]
*  But I think in direct response to your question, I think it will be exceedingly difficult, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1429.1000000000001s)]
*  arguably impossible for the Saudi leadership to proceed with a normalization with Israel [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1435.34s)]
*  without addressing a significant way the question of Palestine. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1442.82s)]
*  Not necessarily out of any love for the Palestinians, but out of the need to maintain domestic [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1447.62s)]
*  stability and legitimacy. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1454.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, there is a potential path where the Trump administration could offer enough [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1455.6999999999998s)]
*  of a fig leaf to the Saudis with respect to Palestinian statehood. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1464.3s)]
*  So for example, the Trump administration could dust off Jared Kushner's plan and say, we [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1469.18s)]
*  endorse, here's a plan for a Palestinian state in these borders, and we're ready to sign [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1474.22s)]
*  on to it tomorrow and be committed to it and even put some money into it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1478.82s)]
*  And then the Palestinians rejected. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1483.1000000000001s)]
*  And then Mohammed bin Salman gets to say, look, I gave it the old college try, and now [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1484.56s)]
*  we're going to proceed with normalization so I can get my nuclear deal and I can get [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1488.26s)]
*  other things. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1492.1200000000001s)]
*  Speaking again of Prince Jared Kushner, it's been tried. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1493.32s)]
*  You know, they saw what happened in 2020. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1499.76s)]
*  You had the normalization with the United Arab Emirates. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1503.4799999999998s)]
*  The Emiratis, speaking of fig leafs, tried to present this as the reason they did this [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1507.4399999999998s)]
*  was to prevent... [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1513.6799999999998s)]
*  Stop annexation. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1514.6799999999998s)]
*  ... which annexation had already been taken off the table for Israeli reasons. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  And I don't think that, certainly not in the current moment, that these kinds of fig [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1522.0s)]
*  leafs will cover very much. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1529.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1531.68s)]
*  So we could spend a lot of time talking about the current moment, but I do want to take [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1532.68s)]
*  advantage of your deep thinking on the broader conflict. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1536.8s)]
*  You know, I wasn't planning to ask you this, but you used the term twice, and so I need [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1540.24s)]
*  to. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1544.04s)]
*  You referred to this as a genocide. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1545.04s)]
*  You know, I often hear many of my Israeli colleagues and interlocutors say, well, wait [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1547.88s)]
*  a minute. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1554.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, genocide is not the correct term to describe what happened. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1555.8000000000002s)]
*  On October 7th, Israel was subject to a surprise attack. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1560.1200000000001s)]
*  This is an operation that has always been intended to compel Hamas, which lives underground, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1564.9s)]
*  shields itself with Palestinian people. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1572.48s)]
*  There's always been an operation to compel that organization to release the hostages. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  The death toll in Gaza, which is catastrophic, could have been much less if Hamas had released [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1580.0s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1586.44s)]
*  Your response to that? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, the reason that genocide is known as the crime of crimes is because [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1588.6000000000001s)]
*  unlike murder, for example, there are no mitigating circumstances. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1595.8s)]
*  You can be charged in a court of killing someone and walk free because you can claim, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1602.44s)]
*  convince the judge or the jury or whatever that you did so for legitimate reasons. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1609.04s)]
*  With genocide, that doesn't exist. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1614.28s)]
*  There is no such thing as a justified genocide. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1618.0s)]
*  Now, it is, of course, a legal term with a very specific definition. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1621.44s)]
*  South Africa, to its great credit, for which I think we should be eternally grateful, bought [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1629.16s)]
*  a case against Israel before the International Court of Justice. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1638.56s)]
*  In January of last year, with a very clear majority, the judges ruled that South Africa [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1643.16s)]
*  had presented a plausible case against Israel, that Israel was in violation of its obligations [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1649.32s)]
*  under the Genocide Convention. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1655.8s)]
*  So rather than dismissing this as a frivolous lawsuit, it's now going to a full hearing, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1657.44s)]
*  which will take several years. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1663.52s)]
*  So if you're asking me, is Israel formally guilty of genocide? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1664.76s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll have to wait a few years. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1670.1200000000001s)]
*  But I was reading the papers today and one article referred to the genocide in Myanmar. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1671.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, the court hasn't ruled on that yet either. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1678.1200000000001s)]
*  We have numerous genocide scholars and Holocaust scholars and growing numbers have already [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1681.6s)]
*  reached the determination that Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip since October of 2023 constitute [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1690.36s)]
*  genocide. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1697.96s)]
*  We have a consensus of the world's leading human rights organizations. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1698.96s)]
*  If we were talking about any other state, we wouldn't be asking the question, is it [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1703.84s)]
*  really genocide? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1708.9199999999998s)]
*  But for Israel, there's always an exception. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1710.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure that's fair, Maureen. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1712.2s)]
*  The example you gave of what's happening to the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Rohingya in Myanmar [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1716.2s)]
*  did not have a militant group that was raiding the homes of the majority population in Myanmar, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1722.68s)]
*  taking them hostage, killing them, etc. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1731.64s)]
*  It's not as if the current campaign was unprovoked and in addition, the high degree of civilian [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1734.64s)]
*  casualties is in large part a function of how Hamas wages war by hiding under civilian [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1743.16s)]
*  areas. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1750.44s)]
*  Address that point. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1751.44s)]
*  Well, I would again make two points. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1752.8400000000001s)]
*  The first is that irrespective of any actions by Hamas or anyone else, that cannot serve [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1757.96s)]
*  as an excuse or a rationale for Israel to commit genocide. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1770.68s)]
*  In other words, there are no mitigating circumstances. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1776.6s)]
*  That's why it's called the crime of crimes. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1780.8s)]
*  Genocide is the attempt to eliminate in whole or in part an entire intent to. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1782.56s)]
*  An intent is crucial here. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1789.0s)]
*  Absent intent, you can't have genocide. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1793.04s)]
*  When the world's leading human rights organizations have determined that Israel is perpetrating [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1797.24s)]
*  genocide, when Holocaust and genocide scholars are determining that Israel is perpetrating [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1803.52s)]
*  genocide, it is because they have been able to pinpoint intent. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1809.32s)]
*  The South African submission to the International Court of Justice, which you may have read [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  or seen. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  The intent was, I'll just give one example. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1821.56s)]
*  The German judge at the ICJ did not believe that South Africa had presented a plausible [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1826.08s)]
*  but voted with the majority because he felt the submission on intent was too compelling [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1835.0s)]
*  to ignore. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1844.76s)]
*  And Israel's, it's eradicated the entire educational sector in the Gaza Strip. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1845.96s)]
*  It's eradicated the entire health sector in the Gaza Strip. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1852.88s)]
*  It has imposed a medieval siege that has led to mass starvation and children and infants [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  dying of hunger and of exposure. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1865.9599999999998s)]
*  It has used artificial intelligence in a way not just to target militants, but in a way [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1869.8799999999999s)]
*  that ensures that their entire families and neighbors are killed along with them. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1877.76s)]
*  I think the evidence is overwhelming. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1886.52s)]
*  The International Court of Justice will have its say in a few years. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1888.88s)]
*  And just one last point, I'm not an expert on South Asia, but my understanding is that [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  the military authorities in Myanmar also claim to be engaged in a legitimate military campaign [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1898.92s)]
*  against an illegitimate insurrection. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  And similarly in Bosnia, of course, the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbian government also claimed [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1909.6399999999999s)]
*  to be engaging in a legitimate military campaign against an illegitimate armed provocation. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1917.8s)]
*  You know, I think we've, you know, I understand your perspective on this. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1926.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, the point you made about eradicating the educational sector, the health [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1930.72s)]
*  sector, et cetera, again, you know, an Israeli interlocutor might say, well, that's because [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1935.28s)]
*  Hamas hides under them. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1939.92s)]
*  Except they weren't. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1941.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, the tunnel network in Gaza, the extentiveness of that is not subject to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1942.24s)]
*  debate. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1949.04s)]
*  But let's take Al-Shifa Hospital, the best known case. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1950.04s)]
*  You know, we were fed computer generated images of a Hamas pentagon under Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1952.6s)]
*  a tunnel network. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1959.48s)]
*  It's where all the Hamas leaders were hiding. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1960.56s)]
*  It's where they were keeping their hostages. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1963.68s)]
*  It turned out to be nothing more than a computer generated image. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1965.84s)]
*  And when the Israelis finally got into Al-Shifa Hospital, there was nothing there. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1972.24s)]
*  They raised the hospital to the ground nonetheless. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1978.08s)]
*  So sure, we can have a discussion about human shields. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1982.36s)]
*  Nothing there. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1987.52s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1988.52s)]
*  I mean, there were tunnels under Shifa. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1989.52s)]
*  There was no... the Israeli accusations were completely bogus. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1991.0s)]
*  There were tunnels under Shifa. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1996.32s)]
*  And as former Israeli... [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1998.04s)]
*  I mean, they didn't find Hamas militants because they'd gone somewhere else. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=1999.04s)]
*  No, but as former Prime Minister Ehud Barak pointed out, yes, there were tunnels under [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2001.8799999999999s)]
*  Shifa because Israel built them in the 1970s or 1980s. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2007.8s)]
*  So this idea that, you know, also Israel has demonstrated through the decades that it has [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2012.28s)]
*  absolutely no regard for civilian casualties. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2023.0s)]
*  So this idea that Hamas would deliberately implant itself in schools or hospitals because [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2026.16s)]
*  it thinks that that will keep Israel from bombing these places, it doesn't make sense. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2033.72s)]
*  I mean, they know as well as anyone that if Israel can locate them in a school or hospital, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2040.0s)]
*  it won't hesitate to drop a 2000 bomb on these facilities. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2046.64s)]
*  Population of Gaza is around 2 million? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2051.44s)]
*  2.3 million in October 2023. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2053.48s)]
*  The number of deaths in the war since October 2023. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2056.08s)]
*  Those we know of, I think, are in the range of 45 to 50,000. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2060.92s)]
*  Indirect deaths, we don't have statistics on indirect deaths and it is assumed, I think [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2067.56s)]
*  accurately, that there are also many thousands under the rubble. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2074.2s)]
*  And that's without also taking into account, you know, the long-term repercussions. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2078.88s)]
*  I mean, there's again a response that you might hear from somebody in Israel that says, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2083.96s)]
*  If you just look at that death toll, that is not the death toll that would be lodged [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2089.04s)]
*  or produced by a country that is seeking to eliminate a population. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  That in other words, when the Israelis say that they have tried to limit civilian casualties [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2103.24s)]
*  in this operation, that the fact that the death toll, as catastrophic as it is, is not [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2108.84s)]
*  many orders of magnitude larger is evidence in favor of the proposition that they are [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2115.32s)]
*  not trying to wage genocide. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2121.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, how do you kill, you know, 40,000, 40,000 plus people in a postage stamp-sized [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2123.1600000000003s)]
*  territory in the space of a year and then claim, well, I could have killed a million? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, if that's the best defense. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  How many of them are Hamas fighters? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2141.48s)]
*  Well, again, those, I don't think we have specific details on that, but I think it's [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2143.52s)]
*  an organization called Air Wars that did a study of only October 2023 and looking at [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2151.8s)]
*  the proportion of miners, of which we can assume that at least 100% of them are not [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2162.08s)]
*  Hamas fighters. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  Of women, you know, we're also 100% of them are not Hamas fighters. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  Fighting-age men, where we can assume that of course a proportion of them were Hamas [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2176.3999999999996s)]
*  fighters and a proportion were not. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2181.08s)]
*  And it came to some pretty devastating conclusions. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2183.64s)]
*  And this is an organization whose findings are embraced by the Pentagon that are used [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2186.3599999999997s)]
*  by the U.S. government and so on. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2192.3599999999997s)]
*  So, you know, to me, the evidence is overwhelming and incontestable. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2194.4399999999996s)]
*  It is, but, you know, I'm not the authority on this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2200.16s)]
*  That is the International Court of Justice. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2205.24s)]
*  The International Court of Justice has concluded that Israel has a case to answer. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2207.44s)]
*  And pending its final ruling on this issue, we already have the world's leading human [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2212.92s)]
*  rights organizations, a growing number of genocide and Holocaust scholars, and, you [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2219.08s)]
*  know, a number of specialist organizations like Air Wars basically concluding, yes, this [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2228.64s)]
*  is a genocide. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2234.48s)]
*  That's good enough for me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2235.48s)]
*  OK, let's move on to, you know, the broader set of issues. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, we all know that history did not begin on October 7th. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2244.16s)]
*  But nonetheless, what happened on October 7th was monstrous. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2252.48s)]
*  And in addition, what Hamas did before October 7th to the people of Gaza was oppressive and, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2258.12s)]
*  you know, similarly monstrous in my view. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2270.36s)]
*  And so one question that many of my American friends, very well-meaning progressives, ask [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2273.36s)]
*  me all the time is, given this organization that has meted out such suffering to Israelis [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2281.92s)]
*  on October 7th and to Palestinians in Gaza prior to October 7th, why do Palestinian intellectuals [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2288.6800000000003s)]
*  not put Hamas beyond the pale? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2299.48s)]
*  Well, let me try to answer that with an analogy. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2304.52s)]
*  I grew up in the Netherlands. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2308.72s)]
*  And the Netherlands, as you know, was under German occupation during the Second World [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2311.96s)]
*  War. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2317.9199999999996s)]
*  And ultimately, the efforts of the United States and its Western allies notwithstanding, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2320.9199999999996s)]
*  ultimately, the reason Nazi Germany was defeated was because of the Soviet Union. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2329.12s)]
*  Now, not many Dutch people were communists or revered Stalin as a leader, but they cheered [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2337.32s)]
*  every one of his defeats against the Nazi armies. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2344.92s)]
*  And in doing so, they weren't rendering a judgment on the Soviet system of government [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2352.16s)]
*  or on liberties within the Soviet Union. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2361.08s)]
*  But they were looking at the Soviet Union in the context of their direct enemy, of the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2365.32s)]
*  state that was occupying their homeland and slaughtering their people. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2374.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think Palestinians, you know, many Palestinians have been critical, even bitterly critical, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2380.36s)]
*  of Hamas in relation to its hegemonic rule within the Gaza Strip. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2386.4s)]
*  But when it comes to looking at Hamas in its confrontations with Israel, they look at it [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2392.64s)]
*  very differently. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2400.04s)]
*  They look at that through the prism of Israel's oppression of their people, its dispossession [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2402.28s)]
*  of their people over the course of the better part of a century. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2409.52s)]
*  So I think, you know, people look at the same organization in different ways, depending [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2413.16s)]
*  on the circumstances. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2421.72s)]
*  So last year, we interviewed Einat Wilf, who's an Israeli former member of Knesset. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2423.92s)]
*  And she says, look, the reason that Palestinians will not condemn Hamas is because ultimately, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2430.12s)]
*  just can't accept any Jewish sovereignty in any part of the Holy Land, historic Palestine, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2440.24s)]
*  Land of Israel, whatever you want to call it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2449.0s)]
*  And so when Hamas goes and kidnaps and kills people living in the Gaza envelope who are, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2451.12s)]
*  these Israelis living in the Gaza envelope, were the most left Israelis, the ones most [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2459.72s)]
*  committed to coexistence and peace with the Palestinians, and they go and kill these [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2465.88s)]
*  people and call them settlers, you know, that is a powerful demonstration. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2470.04s)]
*  And then Palestinians don't condemn that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2475.32s)]
*  No Palestinian voice will condemn that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2477.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a powerful demonstration of the fact that the real problem here is Palestinians [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2479.88s)]
*  cannot accept any Jewish sovereignty in this place. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2483.96s)]
*  Well, I think that shows that the real problem is Israeli occupation, which has reached a [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2486.56s)]
*  point where many Palestinians, even when confronted with atrocities perpetrated by [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2492.72s)]
*  Palestinians, either refuse to believe they happened or can't bring themselves to condemn [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2501.6s)]
*  them because of the visceral feelings they have against the state that dispossessed them, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2507.04s)]
*  that exiled them, that occupied them, that is engaged with an insatiable lust for their [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2515.12s)]
*  land that is now speaking openly about killing every last one of them. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2520.32s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the tenor of Israeli commentary and mainstream media and so on. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2525.76s)]
*  I mean, more on the right, I would say. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2532.32s)]
*  I mean, several people, including in Israel, have made the observation that Israel is transforming [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2534.8s)]
*  into a genocidal society. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2543.8s)]
*  I don't speak or read Hebrew, so I can't offer kind of a conclusion on that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2546.0s)]
*  But from what I have seen, it's certainly worth discussing whether Israeli society has [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2553.0s)]
*  become extreme to the point of irrationality in the way that it talks about Palestinians. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2562.36s)]
*  Now, have Palestinians accepted the principle of Jewish sovereignty? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2572.04s)]
*  Of course not, nor should they. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2576.52s)]
*  What is Jewish sovereignty? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2579.36s)]
*  Israeli sovereignty, they have recognized, but why should they recognize a specific Jewish [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2582.0s)]
*  sovereignty? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2588.84s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2589.84s)]
*  The principle, I think, is absurd. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2592.04s)]
*  You talk about the Israelis having an insatiable thirst for Palestinian land, the current conflict [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2594.06s)]
*  war in Gaza, in your view is an illustration of that. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2601.64s)]
*  Israeli might say, well, what are you talking about an insatiable thirst for Palestinian [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2606.56s)]
*  land? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2610.64s)]
*  We left Gaza. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2611.64s)]
*  We pulled up stakes and we said, you guys go your way. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2613.64s)]
*  And instead of them trying to build something in Gaza, they dug tunnels, they built rockets, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2617.68s)]
*  and they shot them at us, and then they pulled off October 7th. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2623.6s)]
*  Well, one has to look at the circumstances of the 2005 Israeli disengagement from the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2627.28s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2634.44s)]
*  Israel went out of its way not to negotiate its disengagement, as it calls it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2636.08s)]
*  It absolutely refused to negotiate with the Palestinian Authority. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2642.84s)]
*  First it used the excuse that Yasser Arafat was not a partner for peace, and after he [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  was removed from the scene it continued to refuse to negotiate with his successor Mahmoud [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2652.24s)]
*  Abbas. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2657.2s)]
*  You look at Israeli commentary from that period, and they were openly discussing, openly predicting [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2658.2s)]
*  that the way in which Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip would lead to a schism with [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2665.4799999999996s)]
*  the Gaza Strip dominated by Hamas and the West Bank dominated by Fatah. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2672.6s)]
*  And that's indeed what happened. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2677.9199999999996s)]
*  That's not their fault. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2679.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's not their fault that they correctly read the dysfunctions in the Palestinian camp. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2681.0s)]
*  It was more than correctly reading the dysfunction. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2685.92s)]
*  It was setting the stage that helped make a certain development all but inevitable. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2688.32s)]
*  But if I can just add one more point. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2693.84s)]
*  Again, you look at what was being said at the time by the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2696.1200000000003s)]
*  Sharon, and by the statements made by US President George W. Bush at the time. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2700.6000000000004s)]
*  Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in order to strengthen its grip on the West Bank. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2709.76s)]
*  There were multiple reasons Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, one of which was in order [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2716.1600000000003s)]
*  to strengthen its grip on the West Bank. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2722.28s)]
*  And in addition, Israel remained the occupying power in the Gaza Strip, according to the [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2725.36s)]
*  International Committee of the Red Cross, according to human rights organizations. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2730.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's not like Israel upstakes and left and allowed Palestinians to deal with this [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2734.96s)]
*  territory as a soffit. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2742.68s)]
*  And in addition, the Gaza Strip is not Palestine. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2745.08s)]
*  To think, why should Palestinians take satisfaction with having only rule over the Gaza Strip [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2750.92s)]
*  while Israel continues to occupy and expand its control over the West Bank, including [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2759.72s)]
*  East Jerusalem? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2766.72s)]
*  But he said that they should take satisfaction. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2767.72s)]
*  But there's an alternative path that the Palestinians could have taken. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2770.16s)]
*  And you tell me what I'm getting wrong here, which is that instead of using this small [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2774.8399999999997s)]
*  territory that the Israelis have now left in order to demonstrate a capacity for self-governance, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2779.0s)]
*  they used it as a staging ground for resistance. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2787.18s)]
*  And the whole problem, somebody like Walter Russell Mead might say, is that the Palestinians [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2791.18s)]
*  have been all about resistance and not about building their own alternative. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2796.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think the idea that you can build a state under occupation is [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2800.22s)]
*  a bit of an illusion. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2805.8599999999997s)]
*  Isn't that what the Israelis did? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2806.8599999999997s)]
*  Wasn't the Yishuv under colonial sovereignty? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2808.14s)]
*  They built it under British occupation. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2811.5s)]
*  And British occupation was, of course, devoted to the establishment of a Jewish national [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2813.42s)]
*  home. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2819.54s)]
*  Not by the end. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2820.54s)]
*  You know, but by that time... [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2821.54s)]
*  You're talking about the Balfour Declaration. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2822.54s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the 20s and 30s. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2823.54s)]
*  I'm talking about the 20s and 30s, where the British colonial government quite clearly [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2825.98s)]
*  had as a strategic objective the development of what... [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2833.62s)]
*  Were the British determined to establish a Jewish state in Palestine? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2837.26s)]
*  Maybe not, but certainly Jewish national institutions and a Jewish national home. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2843.02s)]
*  As far as the Gaza Strip is concerned, first of all, as I mentioned, the occupation did [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2847.86s)]
*  not end. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2852.46s)]
*  Then when the Palestinians held a democratic election in 2006 and the wrong party won, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2854.46s)]
*  Israel imposed a blockade. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2863.1s)]
*  In fact, the West imposed a blockade as well. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2865.1s)]
*  So the idea that the Palestinians ever had an opportunity to engage in the kind of self-governance [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2868.42s)]
*  and development, which you mentioned, that opportunity never existed. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2875.88s)]
*  What existed was occupation. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2881.38s)]
*  What existed was blockade. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2883.8s)]
*  You know, you had a unit in the Israeli military literally calculating how many calories Palestinians [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2886.42s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip needed to survive but not starve to death. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2895.76s)]
*  I'm not going to draw any historical comparisons here, but the idea that with this kind of [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2904.28s)]
*  adversary, the idea that Palestinians ever had an opportunity to engage in self-government [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2910.96s)]
*  and development unencumbered by Israel's... [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2921.0s)]
*  They would have been massively encumbered by Israel, absolutely. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2925.6s)]
*  But a Palestinian attempt at self-governance in the Gaza Strip that didn't involve lobbing [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2928.6s)]
*  rockets at Israel would have ended up better than the situation we're in now. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2934.94s)]
*  That happened in the 1990s. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2939.12s)]
*  That happened in the 1990s after Oslo. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2941.44s)]
*  I remember the Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2946.16s)]
*  There wasn't a single paved road in the Gaza Strip before 1993. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2949.84s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority... [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I was never a proponent of the Oslo agreements. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  I opposed them for the very beginning. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2962.04s)]
*  But credit where it's due, the Palestinians... [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2966.32s)]
*  You opposed it because it did not guarantee a Palestinian state. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2968.2400000000002s)]
*  Because there was no way that it was going to end well. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2971.6400000000003s)]
*  That was clear from the very outset. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2975.84s)]
*  But that notwithstanding, credit where it's due, the Palestinian Authority during the [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2978.56s)]
*  1990s engaged in a massive program of institution building, of infrastructural development. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2983.2000000000003s)]
*  And the Palestinian economy during the 90s continued to deteriorate because you cannot [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2992.48s)]
*  build a state under occupation. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=2998.2000000000003s)]
*  You need to end the occupation. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3001.76s)]
*  You need to remove the occupation in order to successfully engage in the types of activities [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3003.52s)]
*  that you mentioned. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3010.08s)]
*  So in your narrative, Maureen, how much responsibility do the Palestinians bear for the situation? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3011.16s)]
*  None at all? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3017.16s)]
*  Well, the Palestinians... [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3018.16s)]
*  Is the story just Israel being this mastermind with the Americans and the international community [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3019.44s)]
*  just working at every turn to thwart the Palestinians because... [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3025.68s)]
*  Well, do the Palestinians bear responsibility for being dispossessed and expelled from their [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3031.04s)]
*  homeland by Israel? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3035.88s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3037.56s)]
*  Do the Palestinians bear any responsibility for being occupied since 1967? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3038.56s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3047.0s)]
*  Do the Palestinians bear any responsibility for the fact that the International Court [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3048.56s)]
*  of Justice last July determined that this occupation is illegal and must end as rapidly [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3052.6s)]
*  as possible? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3059.28s)]
*  Yes, they do bear some responsibility for helping to bring that case to the International [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3060.32s)]
*  Court of Justice. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3064.96s)]
*  But other than that, none whatsoever. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3065.96s)]
*  Do the Palestinians have responsibilities in terms of how they could have more effectively [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3068.1200000000003s)]
*  organized and mobilized? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3074.96s)]
*  Yes, of course they do. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3077.28s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to get you to comment on. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3079.4s)]
*  What does effectively organizing mean? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3082.5s)]
*  Isn't they have more effectively organized some of the institutions of self-government? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3085.96s)]
*  I don't know why you're not responding to this point that I'm making, which is in an [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3091.64s)]
*  alternative universe where Hamas is not lobbying rockets at Israel and is instead dedicated [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3097.44s)]
*  towards trying to build up what exists in Gaza under the extraordinarily difficult and [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3104.2400000000002s)]
*  unfair circumstances that you describe, I think that's a situation that would have ended [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3110.44s)]
*  better. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3114.64s)]
*  We have to ask ourselves why the Palestinian leadership didn't do that. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3115.64s)]
*  Well, let me first respond specifically about Hamas. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3120.0s)]
*  You go back to the first major Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip in 2008, Operation Cast [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3128.8399999999997s)]
*  Lead I think it was called. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3135.68s)]
*  Hamas was busy consolidating its power over the Gaza Strip after it seized power in the [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3138.52s)]
*  Gaza Strip in 2007. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3144.44s)]
*  Hamas had reached a ceasefire, a six-month ceasefire with Israel in early 2008. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3147.88s)]
*  Hamas was seeking to extend that ceasefire. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3156.2000000000003s)]
*  What happened is that the Israeli government, seeking to regain some of its stature after [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3159.08s)]
*  its debacle in Lebanon in 2006, decided to launch this onslaught on the Gaza Strip. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3166.2400000000002s)]
*  That wasn't a provoked attack and engaged in widespread destruction. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3173.64s)]
*  Now regarding Palestinian responsibilities, yes, but I think the Palestinian responsibilities [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3181.7999999999997s)]
*  from my point of view are not engaging in development under occupation and self-government [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3188.46s)]
*  under occupation. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3195.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there's nothing wrong with that, but we have to recognize that there's [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3196.56s)]
*  a very low ceiling to what can be achieved under an occupation that is actually an annexation [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3200.4s)]
*  and an occupation that is deepening by the day rather than withdrawing. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3208.12s)]
*  I think the main Palestinian responsibility certainly in this moment is the schism, the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3214.28s)]
*  fragmentation, not being able to overcome the policy of keeping them fragmented and [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3220.36s)]
*  divided, often of putting factional considerations before the national interests. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3229.8s)]
*  Those are certainly entirely legitimate, and it's a grievance, I would argue, that most [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3236.32s)]
*  have, that at a time when Palestinians are facing an existential crisis as they've never [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3244.46s)]
*  encountered before, you have key Palestinians who are invested in the continuation of the [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3252.34s)]
*  schism and who are sniping at each other rather than uniting to confront this existential [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3261.42s)]
*  moment. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3269.58s)]
*  Doesn't that suggest that the problem, that job number one for Palestinians is to cast [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3270.9s)]
*  off this leadership, a pox on... [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3278.7799999999997s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3280.9s)]
*  ...in your... [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3281.9s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3282.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3283.9s)]
*  And so how that would happen is a question. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3284.9s)]
*  How would that happen? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3288.9s)]
*  Do we need an intifada against the PA? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3289.9s)]
*  Well, that would be a nice thing. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3292.8199999999997s)]
*  The problem, of course, is that those who are most loudly repeating the kinds of points [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3295.7s)]
*  that you've been making are those who are most invested not only in maintaining this [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3304.46s)]
*  leadership but in ensuring that this leadership serves Israeli rather than Palestinian interests [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3311.22s)]
*  and giving this leadership all the means it needs to repress its own people rather than [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3318.7799999999997s)]
*  defend them against a deepening and expanding Israeli occupation. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3325.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3332.5s)]
*  I want to... [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3333.5s)]
*  You know, we're coming up on the time where I need to turn it over to the audience otherwise [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3334.5s)]
*  they will subject me to grievous bodily injury. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3338.34s)]
*  But I want to just look forward a little bit into your view of what a solution to this [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3341.94s)]
*  problem might look like. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3349.5s)]
*  You've written very eloquently actually in criticism of one proposed solution to this [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3353.1800000000003s)]
*  problem which is a binational state. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3361.06s)]
*  You have an essay in September 2021 in Jeddah Lea called Can the Palestine Question Be Resolved? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3364.1800000000003s)]
*  You criticize that idea that one binational state is possible and you make instead an [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3371.26s)]
*  argument for a two-state solution. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3379.86s)]
*  Can you describe the logic of your argument? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3382.5s)]
*  Well, logic of my argument at the time, and I should say that was my view some years ago, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3384.7400000000002s)]
*  is that this... [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3393.7400000000002s)]
*  I made several main points. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3397.1800000000003s)]
*  The first one is that I don't think there is a point of no return beyond which the occupation [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3398.42s)]
*  cannot be reversed. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3404.5400000000004s)]
*  As I put it, it's a question of politics, not of physics. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3405.82s)]
*  This is important because those who say one state say, look, the occupation of the West [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3409.66s)]
*  Bank cannot be reversed and so the only solution is for us to all live in one state together. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3414.2599999999998s)]
*  It's also an argument that's... [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3419.2599999999998s)]
*  Israeli opponents of a two-state settlement have always come up with these arguments as [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  well. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3429.94s)]
*  My argument is if you compare the Israeli entrenchment in the occupied territories compared [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3430.94s)]
*  to, for example, the French presence in Algeria, there's no comparison. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3436.94s)]
*  Algeria was recognized as an integral component of France. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3441.94s)]
*  It wasn't even viewed as a foreign territory, something Israelis can only dream of with [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3447.58s)]
*  the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3454.1800000000003s)]
*  I think this absence of international legitimacy creates opportunities for reversing the occupation, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3459.14s)]
*  especially now that it's been ruled as illegal by the International Court of Justice. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3468.14s)]
*  My argument is that if you want a one-state solution... [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3475.14s)]
*  My argument at the time was that if you want a one-state solution, you only have military [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3480.14s)]
*  options. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3486.14s)]
*  There are no political options for a one-state solution, but a two-state settlement can at [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3487.22s)]
*  least theoretically be achieved through political means. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3493.8199999999997s)]
*  Where I've changed my mind now is that I think genocide has consequences. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3498.18s)]
*  I think that this genocidal apartheid regime needs to be held to account and should not [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3504.78s)]
*  be permitted to go back to business as usual, no different than other genocidal regimes. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3518.9s)]
*  You know, i.e., Netanyahu and the members of this cabinet... [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3527.9s)]
*  I said regime, not government. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3531.98s)]
*  But what's changed in your calculation about the fact that you cannot... [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3534.42s)]
*  Because what you're talking about is presumably you're saying, if you're saying this Israel's [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3541.38s)]
*  military action in Gaza should have dire consequences for the entire regime, what are you envisioning? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3545.66s)]
*  The conclusion I've reached is that Israel is not prepared to coexist peacefully with [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3553.2999999999997s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3559.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not prepared to coexist peacefully with the region. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3562.18s)]
*  You look, for example, at Israel's actions in Syria now. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3565.9s)]
*  Israel claimed credit, I think, incorrectly, but nevertheless claimed credit for the ouster [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3572.14s)]
*  of the Assad regime. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3579.2599999999998s)]
*  And what has it done since then? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3582.2999999999997s)]
*  It has occupied something like 400 square kilometers of Syrian territory. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3584.42s)]
*  It's bombing Syria routinely. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3590.58s)]
*  Just today it bombed Damascus. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3593.46s)]
*  And you had a new leadership in Damascus that was going out of its way not to antagonize [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3596.86s)]
*  Israel, was more focused on hostility towards Iran than against Israel, was almost trying [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3603.1400000000003s)]
*  to pretend that Israeli aggression against Syria was not happening because it wanted [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3612.1s)]
*  to focus primarily on domestic issues. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3619.2999999999997s)]
*  And Israel is simply, in my view, incapable of coexisting either with the Palestinians [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3623.4599999999996s)]
*  or with the region. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3630.4199999999996s)]
*  It has reached a stage where the old saying, what is it if you have a nail... [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3631.4199999999996s)]
*  If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3638.8599999999997s)]
*  If you are primarily reliant on military force, every problem becomes a military problem. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3642.3399999999997s)]
*  And there is no military solution to either what's known as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3653.66s)]
*  or to the Arab-Israeli conflict. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3660.8999999999996s)]
*  But Israel is determined to deal with each and every challenge it faces with its adversaries [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3663.14s)]
*  exclusively through military means. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3670.5s)]
*  It sounds like, Ma'een, and then I do need to open it up, it sounds like you are describing [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3674.6600000000003s)]
*  Israel's behavior, the Netanyahu government's behavior, as a deterministic function of some [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3679.02s)]
*  Israeli essence. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3686.5s)]
*  No. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3687.94s)]
*  Whereas, you say the Israelis can't coexist. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3688.94s)]
*  They were... [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3691.86s)]
*  During the Trump administration when they were signing the peace deals in Morocco, you [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3695.46s)]
*  one wouldn't have said that. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3700.66s)]
*  One would have said, like, oh, Israel is moving more towards coexistence. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3701.7s)]
*  And then, you know, October 7th intervenes. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3704.7s)]
*  And so let me just flip this question, then I'm going to open it up to the audience. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3707.7799999999997s)]
*  So somebody could read your writing and say, actually, no, again, it's the Palestinians [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3713.02s)]
*  and including, you know, gifted, sagacious, wise Palestinians like Ma'een Rabani who don't [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3719.54s)]
*  want to coexist. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3725.86s)]
*  So even in this article called Can the Palestine Question Be Resolved, which is about arguing [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3726.9s)]
*  for a two-state solution, you say, you know, in order to have one state, you need a, quote, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3733.1800000000003s)]
*  credible military option that overwhelms and vanquishes Israel. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3738.94s)]
*  And you say that's neither presently available nor within foreseeable reach. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3742.6600000000003s)]
*  Although later in the article, you do say it may emerge one day sooner than anticipated. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3747.02s)]
*  And so it sounds like your argument in that piece is two-state solution is a halfway house [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3752.58s)]
*  on the way towards the eventual eradication of this entire Zionist entity. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3759.1s)]
*  And so what would you say to an Israeli who says, of course, I don't want to make peace [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3765.18s)]
*  with you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3769.42s)]
*  Of course, I'm not going to willingly hand you a state because I know once you get that, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3770.42s)]
*  you're going to do exactly what you did when you were in Gaza, when we left you alone in [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3775.82s)]
*  Gaza, and you will just use that as a staging ground to try to eliminate our project. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3780.06s)]
*  First of all, Israel never left us alone in Gaza. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3786.06s)]
*  It was quite the opposite. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3788.66s)]
*  And it's in that context that we have the catastrophe that's unfolding before our eyes [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3790.2599999999998s)]
*  today. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3795.62s)]
*  So I want to be clear about that. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3796.62s)]
*  Secondly, the argument I made quite explicitly in that article was, you know, I interviewed [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3797.62s)]
*  Edward Said, I think the year before his death, when he was visiting Jerusalem. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3807.38s)]
*  And he, as you know, had been one of the most prominent proponents of a two-state settlement [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3814.1s)]
*  in his 1978 book, The Question of Palestine. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3820.5s)]
*  But then after Oslo, precisely because he felt Oslo undermined the two-state paradigm, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3823.98s)]
*  shifted his view to a one-state solution. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3834.98s)]
*  And I asked him, does this mean you give up the struggle against the occupation? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3841.26s)]
*  And he said, of course not. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3846.46s)]
*  And he said he believed that if Israel was compelled to end its occupation, that this [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3848.18s)]
*  would have a transformative effect on Israel and Israeli public opinion that could eventually [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3855.5s)]
*  open the way to a peaceful future where a one-state reality could be achieved through [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3863.66s)]
*  mutual consent of Israelis and Palestinians, similar to the formula, by the way, that's [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3872.2599999999998s)]
*  in the Good Friday Agreement, which on the one hand does not, of course, call for Irish [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3878.5s)]
*  sovereignty over Northern Ireland, but leaves open that possibility if there are majorities [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3889.3s)]
*  in both the North and the Republic. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3895.3s)]
*  Maureen, I need to open it up to the audience for questions. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3897.46s)]
*  So we have microphones. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3901.1400000000003s)]
*  So I think if you don't raise your hand, maybe you need to line up at the microphones. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3904.38s)]
*  Or how are we doing this? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3908.94s)]
*  Somebody tell me. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3910.26s)]
*  Running mics. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3913.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3914.54s)]
*  So just raise your hand and we'll pass you a mic. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3915.54s)]
*  So why don't we start with this young man in the very back. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3916.7799999999997s)]
*  And before you ask your question, let me just, for those of you who don't know, I need you [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3920.86s)]
*  to ask a question, not to give a speech. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3925.86s)]
*  The only people who can give speeches here are myself and Maureen. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3928.18s)]
*  A question is an interrogative statement that ends in a question mark, a sentence designed [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3931.58s)]
*  to elicit information. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3936.9s)]
*  So please restrict yourself to a question. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3938.84s)]
*  Go ahead, sir. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3941.3s)]
*  I was going to make a speech, but really quickly, I just want to ask a question to sort of better [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3942.3s)]
*  understand. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3946.5s)]
*  I think, you know, we've seen on campus a lot of speakers coming, right? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3947.5s)]
*  We saw Anad Wilf, we saw Naftali Bennett, and we saw Kushner. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3951.14s)]
*  And then on the other side, we saw a handful of Palestinians, a handful of analysts. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3955.1s)]
*  And you know, you can see how unfair it is. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3959.86s)]
*  Like the both sides framing is just completely different. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3962.02s)]
*  So I want to ask how we, you know, me as a Palestinian or as an Arab who goes to Harvard [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3966.4s)]
*  and is not, you know, getting blown up to pieces in Gaza as a privileged Palestinian, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3972.98s)]
*  how can I start building towards something? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3977.32s)]
*  How can I here in the United States with everything going on, build and start moving towards, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3980.34s)]
*  you know, a path to a statehood or liberation for the Palestinians, you know, with all the [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3987.02s)]
*  resources we have here, which are, you know, debated in my opinion. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=3994.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4000.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4001.26s)]
*  Well, you know, I think if you look at the conversation that we've just had, I think [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4002.42s)]
*  it precisely demonstrates the challenge. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4012.0200000000004s)]
*  I think it's kind of conventional wisdom in this country of you have this golden opportunity [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4016.34s)]
*  to create Singapore of the Middle East. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4023.34s)]
*  And instead, you know, you turned it into a missile factory. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4028.22s)]
*  Whereas the argument that needs to be demonstrated is that no, it wasn't given an opportunity [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4033.4199999999996s)]
*  to become Singapore of the Middle East. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4040.4199999999996s)]
*  It was Soweto on the Mediterranean. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4044.2599999999998s)]
*  Always has been. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4047.24s)]
*  And as long as the occupation persists, always will be. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4048.44s)]
*  And I think the role that people like you can play in this country is to inform yourselves [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4052.54s)]
*  and to inform others because you're up, I think, against a narrative in this country [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4059.54s)]
*  that has Israel in the position of victim. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4071.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, if you didn't know better, you would think Israel was under Palestinian [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4074.9s)]
*  occupation. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4078.82s)]
*  You would think it was the Palestinians who went to Poland and Russia to establish an [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4079.94s)]
*  Arab state. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4084.98s)]
*  You know, not that the Zionists came from Europe to transform Palestine into a Jewish [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4086.38s)]
*  state. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4095.38s)]
*  It's an entire role reversal, but that's really beginning to change. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4097.74s)]
*  The problem is that while I think you have had vital shifts in public opinion in this [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4103.3s)]
*  country during the, you know, Palestine has become a kind of universal cause for justice, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4111.3s)]
*  the way apartheid South Africa was in the 70s and 80s. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4119.34s)]
*  That's a feat I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4123.7s)]
*  The challenge now is to transform that into political achievements so that it has an actual [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4126.7s)]
*  impact on policy. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4132.98s)]
*  That's going to be an exceptionally difficult task that is going to require organization [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4134.9s)]
*  and persistence and strategic wisdom. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4142.179999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4145.5s)]
*  Hands. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4146.5s)]
*  I have here David Patel, and then we'll come to you. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4147.5s)]
*  So under what conditions would Hamas... [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4150.5s)]
*  Wait, wait for the mic so that YouTube can hear your question. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4152.5s)]
*  Under what conditions would Hamas accept like a 1982 style evacuation where some number [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4156.339999999999s)]
*  between 5,000 and at least 12 leaders either went into exile in Algeria or Qatar or maybe [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4161.04s)]
*  Ireland or South Africa? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4169.5199999999995s)]
*  And then what effect would that have on Palestinian politics? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4171.16s)]
*  Would the PA fracture? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4175.2s)]
*  Would it not make a difference because new parties would emerge on the right flank? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4176.62s)]
*  Or would it empower the PA in some way? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4181.0s)]
*  Of course, you're referring to the PLO's evacuation from Lebanon at the conclusion [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4185.28s)]
*  of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4192.0199999999995s)]
*  I think there's a fundamental difference here. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4194.5599999999995s)]
*  In 1982, the PLO evacuated from a foreign state. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4197.44s)]
*  I think if Hamas were to evacuate from the Gaza Strip, it would be the end of Hamas, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4203.0s)]
*  especially after all that's happened in the last year and a half. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4210.0s)]
*  Hamas would basically be saying, we launched this attack on Israel in October of 2023 [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4217.0s)]
*  in order to irrevocably shatter the status quo. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4228.4s)]
*  Gaza is in ruins, but we're now going to go on holiday in Al-Arish. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4231.44s)]
*  I find it impossible, virtually impossible, I should add, to envision circumstances under [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4239.0s)]
*  which Hamas would accept such a proposal. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4245.16s)]
*  And if they do, I think they're finished as a movement. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4249.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, I have a question over here. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4252.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4255.48s)]
*  My name is Amit. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4256.48s)]
*  I'm one of Professor Masoud's students. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4259.48s)]
*  I'm coming from Israel. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4265.2s)]
*  I'm coming out of this talk a bit discouraged, but I'm going to try to extract some hope. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4267.24s)]
*  Let's say that on October 6th, and just for the sake of my question, half of Israel's [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4276.5599999999995s)]
*  population, let's say half of the Jewish population, because it's not only Jewish, was in favor [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4282.5599999999995s)]
*  in the two-state solution. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4288.92s)]
*  You're saying they were, or let's suppose they were? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4291.48s)]
*  I'm saying that in my opinion it was half, but in the sake of my question, let's say, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4294.08s)]
*  because I don't want to fight on data here, just about that, let's say, and I actually [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4298.84s)]
*  think it was half. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4303.28s)]
*  Obviously, on October 7th, go on, that's reduced. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4305.28s)]
*  Everybody can say that, and we don't need to argue about that. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4309.76s)]
*  And after looking at polls done in the West Bank by Palestinians, you can see that the [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4313.76s)]
*  majority, like if there was going to be an election tomorrow or today, Hamas would probably [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4321.4800000000005s)]
*  going to win and going to be the government in the West Bank, meaning that the two-state [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4326.4400000000005s)]
*  solution, even for the people who were optimistic, dropping down to a handful, maybe. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4332.6s)]
*  So in that case, and looking at that information and data, how can we move forward? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4338.96s)]
*  And that's the kind of extract hope question. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4346.96s)]
*  I would ask you to look at that answer, not to put words in your mouth, but look at a [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4350.5199999999995s)]
*  concrete solution, not something that you know would not fly. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4358.36s)]
*  And don't try to look at the government, because I know it's hard, because Netanyahu is in [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4362.32s)]
*  office now, he won't stay there forever. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4367.04s)]
*  So try to look at it from the Israeli population point of view, in a way. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4370.839999999999s)]
*  And when you say we, are you referring to us or specifically to Israelis? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4375.4s)]
*  I'm talking about majority Israelis who doesn't want to echo my friends over there, don't [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4379.76s)]
*  want to be blown up, stabbed or killed in a way. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4385.76s)]
*  And how can we move forward to a two-state settlement? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4391.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that your... [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4394.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4395.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very difficult situation at present. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4396.4800000000005s)]
*  My own view is that the fundamental problem is that there are no consequences attached [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4403.719999999999s)]
*  to Israeli conduct towards the Palestinians. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4412.28s)]
*  European countries, they like to wag their fingers and talk about human rights and rule [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4420.08s)]
*  of law and all the rest of it, but when push comes to shove, they won't lift a finger against [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4424.599999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4430.28s)]
*  And in this country, of course, you know it better than I do. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4431.28s)]
*  I think we've reached the point where the only thing that will have a positive impact [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4434.92s)]
*  on the Israeli public and particularly on the Israeli political class is consequences, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4443.28s)]
*  where the costs of maintaining the occupation begin to exceed its benefits. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4450.8s)]
*  Absent that, I really don't see hope for an improvement in the situation because if you [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4458.8s)]
*  look at what's happened since October 23, I would look at how much support Israel has [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4466.96s)]
*  gotten. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4474.72s)]
*  It would almost be counterintuitive for Israelis to want to reverse course now because there [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4476.28s)]
*  have been absolutely no consequences attached. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4484.28s)]
*  You look at what's happening in the West Bank. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4489.28s)]
*  Sure, you had a few settlers getting their assets frozen or a travel ban or whatever. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4492.88s)]
*  Even that's been reversed, and that was purely symbolic to begin with. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4500.88s)]
*  So I think the only hope here is to ensure that the costs exceed the benefits. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4508.16s)]
*  I think a version of his question is, why did the Palestinians not do more to increase [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4517.64s)]
*  that 50% of Israelis who wanted a two-state solution? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4530.52s)]
*  I think I can anticipate your response, which is to say, look, I'm a Palestinian living [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4535.44s)]
*  under occupation. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4541.5599999999995s)]
*  But I'm thinking we live in the world, and this world that we live in, you don't get [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4543.96s)]
*  a state because you deserve it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4549.5599999999995s)]
*  You get a state because you have been able to convince the relevant veto players, the [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4551.719999999999s)]
*  international community, that this is not inimical to their interests. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4558.12s)]
*  That's actually what the State of Israel did to get started. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4563.6s)]
*  That's why when the State of Israel announces itself, it's immediately recognized by both [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4567.08s)]
*  the U.S. and the USSR. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4571.320000000001s)]
*  I guess he's asking, should the Palestinians or can the Palestinians do anything to get [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4575.360000000001s)]
*  us back to that state where 50% and maybe 60%, 70%, 75% of Israelis also say, look, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4580.68s)]
*  we've got to end this occupation and have peace with these people. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4586.6s)]
*  And clearly, October 7th isn't the way to do it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4589.8s)]
*  Well, I would argue that the past three decades have demonstrated that there's virtually [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4593.48s)]
*  nothing the Palestinians can do to persuade a majority of Israelis that their desire for [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4601.76s)]
*  a two-state settlement was genuine. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4610.92s)]
*  We're going back even further. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4613.92s)]
*  The demand was that the Palestinians had to recognize Israel. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4615.6s)]
*  When they recognized Israel, okay, but do you recognize Israel's right to exist? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4622.8s)]
*  They recognized Israel's right to exist, but do you recognize Israel as a Jewish state? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4627.88s)]
*  I like to use the analogy of a hamster in a wheel. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4634.0s)]
*  The faster you run, the more you stay in the same place. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4641.320000000001s)]
*  The Palestinians recognized Israel and its right to exist and established security forces [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4647.68s)]
*  to repress their own people and prevent further action against Israel. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4655.08s)]
*  Everything they have done has failed to persuade. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4669.0s)]
*  Because I don't think it's a matter of persuasion. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4672.96s)]
*  I think the Israeli establishment has decided on a policy of permanent control over the [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4675.4s)]
*  Palestinian people. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4683.5599999999995s)]
*  It has continued to expand. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4685.44s)]
*  When Palestinians did exactly what was asked of them by the Israelis, the Israeli response [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4689.28s)]
*  was to expand settlements and to seize more Palestinian land. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4694.5599999999995s)]
*  Could the Palestinians have done more here or there in order to engage directly with [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4700.72s)]
*  Israelis during the 1990s? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4708.08s)]
*  Yeah, of course they could have. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4710.12s)]
*  The fundamental obstacle was an Israeli unwillingness to accept the legitimacy of Palestinian self-determination [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4714.280000000001s)]
*  on their own land. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4725.68s)]
*  That goes back to the very origins where the Zionist movement was determined to transform [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4727.24s)]
*  Palestine from an Arab territory into a Jewish state. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4735.92s)]
*  And that's been a continuing process. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4740.28s)]
*  We have time for two more questions. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4743.0s)]
*  I'm going to take them both. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4744.2s)]
*  I have a question here and a question there. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4745.639999999999s)]
*  We'll start here and try to be concise. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4749.599999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4753.8s)]
*  Just wanted to say briefly on the point of building institutions in Gaza, land, air, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4755.12s)]
*  and sea, besieged by land, air, and sea, and then five military operations on there in [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4759.8s)]
*  20 years doesn't make for institution building. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4765.2s)]
*  My question is about the regional. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4768.24s)]
*  I think shattering clearly of what was called the axis of resistance links. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4769.92s)]
*  Is the axis of Zionism also breaking a little bit? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4775.28s)]
*  We've talked a lot about Saudi Arabia. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4779.2s)]
*  We haven't talked as much about the other Gulf countries, Morocco, Egypt. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4781.62s)]
*  Now you've sort of discussed this discussion among the Arab countries regarding the future [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4785.9s)]
*  of Gaza. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4793.22s)]
*  Is trust in the United States as their interlocutor regarding regional politics breaking or am [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4794.7s)]
*  I overstating what's happening there? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4800.14s)]
*  No. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4802.38s)]
*  I think we already saw this very clearly with the Arab response to the Russian invasion of [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4803.38s)]
*  Ukraine. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4808.5s)]
*  I think key Arab states have been engaged in a process I call strategic diversification [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4810.7s)]
*  for quite a few years now. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4818.099999999999s)]
*  I think the first Trump administration was an important turning point in terms of how [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4819.38s)]
*  when the Iranians bombed the Aramco facilities and the Americans didn't respond. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4827.66s)]
*  So yes, they view the United States as their key strategic partner, but they're also [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4833.3s)]
*  building relations with the Russians, with the Chinese. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4840.54s)]
*  I mean, Egypt is now buying arms from Russia. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4843.74s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is regulating oil prices through the OPEC plus arrangement that includes Russia. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4850.3s)]
*  China is the main importer of Gulf energy. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4860.74s)]
*  The United Arab Emirates is a very good example, which is seen as the one closest to the United [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4868.18s)]
*  States, but also has extensive links with Russia and with China. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4873.06s)]
*  This isn't the Cold War where you're either with Washington or with Moscow. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4880.3s)]
*  I think many of these governments have decided that they can and should have good relations [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4886.54s)]
*  with all major powers, with all global powers on different issues. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4894.3s)]
*  OK, we have a last question over here. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4899.900000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm Dhanush Laifer, a visiting fellow here. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4902.46s)]
*  I wanted to ask, in 2009, there was a negotiation going on for a year that got to real settlements [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4906.46s)]
*  on water, on Jerusalem, on a lot of issues. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4916.5s)]
*  And the Omar Tabas negotiations. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4919.9800000000005s)]
*  And there was a real proposition on the table that was pretty good for the Palestinians. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4923.38s)]
*  And Abbas said no for a number of reasons, but this was, I think, the closest chance [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4927.54s)]
*  that the Palestinians had to proceeding to a state. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4934.22s)]
*  And you have not talked about this in your analysis of the situation, but how could this [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4938.54s)]
*  have played out and how do you see this as part of the whole story? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4944.3s)]
*  Can I just add to that? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4950.22s)]
*  Because again, when Anat Wilf was here, she mentioned something like this. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4951.820000000001s)]
*  And she said, you know, when I stopped really being a two-stater is when in 2009, when the [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4955.58s)]
*  Palestinians didn't ink this deal, there was not a single dissenting voice among the Palestinians [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4962.740000000001s)]
*  that said, man, this was a good deal. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4969.38s)]
*  We should have taken it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4970.820000000001s)]
*  Sorry, and now I'll let you answer. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4971.820000000001s)]
*  The story of that deal. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4975.26s)]
*  First of all, I don't think the percentages are quite the way that Omert has presented [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4977.34s)]
*  them. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4981.9400000000005s)]
*  They were somewhat less. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4982.9400000000005s)]
*  But the important thing is that by this point, it was already transparently obvious that [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4985.1s)]
*  Omert was on his way out. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4991.5s)]
*  He was, I think, if you would know better, he was already indicted, I think. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4994.34s)]
*  Tzipi Livni actually went to the Palestinians and told them not to sign it. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=4999.94s)]
*  So, you know, it's I think another example you could give in this respect is I think [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5007.46s)]
*  it was Taba in 2001, the Taba negotiations. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5015.34s)]
*  And there they actually reached a conclusion, but it was meaningless because Barak was already [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5019.7s)]
*  on his way out. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5027.58s)]
*  So the problem there was that there was no opportunity to finalize an agreement with [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5028.58s)]
*  a government that was actually, with an Israeli government that was actually capable of carrying [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5036.18s)]
*  out what would have been agreed. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5044.1s)]
*  That was the main obstacle there. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5046.7s)]
*  And I think it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just a question of why didn't Abbas sign [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5048.38s)]
*  on the dotted line. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5057.22s)]
*  There were still issues to be resolved, you know, about percentages, about maps, about [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5058.22s)]
*  details. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5064.66s)]
*  But I think the fundamental problem was that Abbas was not prepared to conclude an agreement [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5065.66s)]
*  with a leader who already had one foot in the political grave. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5073.06s)]
*  So Ma'een, we are now at the end of our time, and I think we could spend another 90 minutes, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5077.820000000001s)]
*  another 90 hours talking to and probing your thoughts and your knowledge about this. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5084.42s)]
*  So I'm really grateful to you. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5090.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5092.02s)]
*  For coming and engaging. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5093.02s)]
*  I'm very grateful to the audience for your excellent and incisive questions. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5094.02s)]
*  I want to also make sure to thank the team of the Middle East Initiative, Julia Martin, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5099.02s)]
*  Marina Lawrenceini, and Paige Ferreira, Paige in particular, who produces all of these events. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5104.06s)]
*  I want to ask you all to join us when we do this again on April 10th with the Egyptian [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5110.38s)]
*  industrialist Naguib Suarez, where we'll talk about democracy in Egypt and the Arab world. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5116.9800000000005s)]
*  And then on May 6th, we'll have the Israeli policy intellectual Mika Goodman. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5122.82s)]
*  So I hope you'll join us for both of those. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5127.9400000000005s)]
*  But for now, all that remains is for all of you to join me in thanking Ma'een Rabben. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5129.9800000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5134.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqQmTUsH8o&t=5135.5s)]
