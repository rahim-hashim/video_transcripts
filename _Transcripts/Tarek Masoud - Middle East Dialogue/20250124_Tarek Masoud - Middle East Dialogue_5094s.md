# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with Einat Wilf
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts)
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here and joining us for the fifth installment in our Middle East dialogue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4.12s)]
*  series, which we are hoping will be remembered by history as a series of real, open, candid [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=12.32s)]
*  conversations with people who hold varied, in some cases, wildly varied views about the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=21.8s)]
*  conflict in Israel and Palestine, its causes, and how it might be brought to an end. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=28.36s)]
*  And one of the reasons I decided to hold the series and to invite the people that I invited [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=35.68s)]
*  was because I believe that there's only so much that we can learn from analysts who profess [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=43.68s)]
*  neutrality and who speak in sonorous tones and who strike these poses of analytic distance [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  and who are consequently able to talk about these issues calmly and measuredly and say [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=55.84s)]
*  how unfortunate the situation is and how it requires leadership and empathy and whatever [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=61.96s)]
*  virtue one deems to be missing from both sides. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=68.12s)]
*  And my conviction is that if peace is to come to that part of the world, it's going to be [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=72.68s)]
*  hammered out by people who hold strong beliefs, strongly opposing beliefs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=77.04s)]
*  And I felt that what I wanted to do was to bring those people to this campus and to see [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=83.2s)]
*  what we could learn from them and about them by talking with them and even in some cases [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  arguing with them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  And our guest today is somebody that I've argued with before, and I don't think I'm [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  expressing any kind of bias when I say that our guest is somebody from whom I always learn [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=102.68s)]
*  an enormous amount when we argue. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=107.84s)]
*  I might even go further and say I'm not even sure I've ever won when we have argued. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=110.24s)]
*  And our guest today is Dr. Inaat Wilf. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=115.6s)]
*  Inaat Wilf is an author, she's a former intelligence analyst, a former McKinsey consultant. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=118.32s)]
*  I'll let you decide which one of those we should be upset with her for being. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=124.88s)]
*  A former advisor to prime ministers, a former member of Knesset, and she's really become [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=129.4s)]
*  one of the most prominent articulators and defenders of the state of Israel's conduct [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=136.96s)]
*  in this war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=141.96s)]
*  And she is also on top of all of this a graduate of Harvard College, so this is her home, and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  a fellow political scientist. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=151.44s)]
*  And so it's really my honor to welcome her here to the John F. Kennedy School of Government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=154.0s)]
*  to talk about the war that her country is waging today and the decade-long struggle [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=158.08s)]
*  that Israelis and Palestinians are having over what is called historical Palestine or [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=163.84s)]
*  Eretz Israel, depending on whom you are. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=171.6s)]
*  So you have all participated in this, or many of you have at least been here before, so [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=174.8s)]
*  you know the drill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=179.84s)]
*  Dr. Wilf and I will speak for about 45 minutes to an hour, and then we'll open it up to questions [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=180.84s)]
*  from my students and the audience, and we will try to end by 1.30. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=186.88s)]
*  There's a couple of things I need to note. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=192.04s)]
*  The first thing to note is that the event is being recorded, and so if you ask a question, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=194.56s)]
*  you are thereby consenting to have your visage beamed across the known universe and preserved [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  for all eternity. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=206.16s)]
*  The second thing I will note is that we are very hopeful that this will be a civil discussion [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  and that there will be no disruptions of any kind. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=215.16s)]
*  It's very important that we're able to have the conversation that we need to have. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=218.88s)]
*  The last thing I'll say is a thing about optics. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=223.88s)]
*  So you know, I've been reading some of the reporting on our series, and the reporting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  on our series is so at odds with how I'm experiencing it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  So I will read things and say, Masoud held a very intense and stressful conversation, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=234.64s)]
*  and I'm thinking, no, it was actually quite fun, and even there's a degree of effervescence [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=241.04s)]
*  that I was experiencing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=245.12s)]
*  And you might see that here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=246.96s)]
*  Those of you who know Dr. Velf and those of you who know me know that both of us conformed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  to the stereotypes of our people and that we are very intense and passionate about our [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=253.68s)]
*  positions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=259.52s)]
*  And at least in my case, the more intense a conversation is, the more I'm enjoying it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=260.8s)]
*  and the more I am evincing my respect and admiration for my interlocutors. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=266.56s)]
*  So you know, there's this concept in the Jewish tradition called an argument for the sake [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=272.12s)]
*  of heaven, and to the extent that Dr. Velf and I will argue, you should understand that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=276.92s)]
*  that's what is happening. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=281.04s)]
*  So please join me in welcoming Dr. Einat Velf. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=282.56s)]
*  Thanks for coming, Einat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=290.64s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=291.64s)]
*  So I wanted to start by getting you to reflect on something I read in one of your books. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=293.0s)]
*  You described yourself as a former leftist who used to believe in the formula of land [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=298.84s)]
*  for peace. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=305.64s)]
*  And I'm definitely not a leftist, but I'm somebody who believes in the formula of land [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=306.64s)]
*  for peace. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=310.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you still believe in that formula? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=311.67999999999995s)]
*  I differentiate between the notion that the conflict is only on land. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=314.67999999999995s)]
*  So therefore, if land is handed over, let's say in the case of the Palestinians, the West [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  Bank and Gaza, that that is what is needed for peace. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=327.36s)]
*  That absolutely, I do not believe anymore. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=332.32s)]
*  It's not a matter of faith. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=335.68s)]
*  We can discuss it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=336.92s)]
*  It's a matter by now of empirical experience. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=338.0s)]
*  So the idea that the conflict is only about things that are related to land, that is certainly [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=342.76s)]
*  what I grew into, believed in, that the day that the Palestinians will have their state [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=348.88s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza is the day that we will have peace. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=356.16s)]
*  As soon as I could vote, I voted for Rabin. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=360.04s)]
*  I voted for Barack. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=362.16s)]
*  I was euphoric in the 90s. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=363.68s)]
*  Like many Israelis of the peace camp, when Barack goes to Camp David, and people know [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=366.8s)]
*  Camp David was already symbolic because this is where peace was negotiated with Egypt, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=371.8s)]
*  precisely based on the formula of land for peace. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=376.88s)]
*  I believed in the vision of a new Middle East. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Like many Israelis of the peace camp, I saw Arafat in 2000 and Abu Mazen in 2008 walk [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=385.0s)]
*  away from clear concrete opportunities to have a state in the West Bank and Gaza, no [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=394.84s)]
*  settlements, capital in East Jerusalem, including holy sites. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=403.12s)]
*  I lived through the misnamed Second Intifada, the butchery of the years following the negotiations [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=407.44s)]
*  in 2000. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=416.32s)]
*  And I began to ask myself, what is going on? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=418.56s)]
*  What do the Palestinians want? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=424.0s)]
*  Because it's clearly not a state because they could have had that and they walked away. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=426.56s)]
*  Not only did they walk away, I see them not being criticized by their people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=434.4s)]
*  So not even a minor Palestinian writing in London, an op-ed saying, are you nuts? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  We are on the verge of having everything we've ever wanted go back into the negotiating room, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=448.0s)]
*  get us our state. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=453.52s)]
*  And during this time, I'm asked, I'm invited to meet Palestinians. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=455.4s)]
*  I work with Shimon Peres at this time. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm a member of the Labor Party. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=461.96s)]
*  I still support two states, the poster child of the Israeli two-stater left. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=463.48s)]
*  And I'm invited to meet moderate Palestinians, the top, the most educated from the negotiation [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=470.48s)]
*  unit. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=476.8s)]
*  And in the conversations with them, they basically tell me things like the Jewish people are [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=478.0s)]
*  not a people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=482.68s)]
*  You're only a religion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=483.84s)]
*  This idea that you have a connection to this land, you invented it to steal our own. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=486.56s)]
*  And I realized from the conversations with them that how they think about the conflict [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=492.8s)]
*  and how I think about it don't even meet. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=497.68s)]
*  For them, the very existence of a sovereign Jewish state is illegitimate. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=501.12s)]
*  And for me, I thought it was about things that have to do with land. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=507.76s)]
*  And that takes me on a journey to look for Palestinian voices that will recognize the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=512.2s)]
*  equal right of the Jewish people to self-determination in their historic homeland. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  And I can say that over by now a process of 20 years, I found only three such people who [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=523.84s)]
*  will clearly, specifically, publicly acknowledge the equal right of the Jewish people as a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=530.96s)]
*  people to self-determination in part of their historic homeland. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=538.64s)]
*  And this got me the research that became the book, The War of Return, and it led me to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=545.0s)]
*  realize that this is the broadest consensus of the Palestinian ethos. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=548.88s)]
*  So even though I continue to support that we live in two states side by side, I now [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=554.2s)]
*  understand that what has to happen before that can happen is that the century-long war [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=560.82s)]
*  against Zionism, against Jewish self-determination has first to end. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=567.72s)]
*  Okay, this is really great and I want to really dive into this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=572.6s)]
*  So somebody might say, so first of all, just to make sure that I'm appropriately understanding, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=577.8800000000001s)]
*  what really drove you to this realization that the Palestinians don't just want some [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  of the land, the Palestinians can't accept Jews having any of the land, right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  What drove you to that realization was the Palestinians' leadership walking away from [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  very good deals. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  To no criticism from the people, with no dissenting voices, and followed by violence. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=604.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so there's an alternative, and I'm assuming, obviously you're talking about Camp David [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=610.4s)]
*  2000, you're also probably talking about the Olmert deal that was quite generous, and what [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=615.4799999999999s)]
*  some people would say is that, actually look, you're definitely right, they made a huge [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=625.84s)]
*  error in walking away from those deals, but it's not because they couldn't accept the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=630.88s)]
*  idea of a Jewish state, it's because they felt that there wasn't enough specificity, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=636.24s)]
*  and I know you've actually talked about specificity, there wasn't enough specificity in the Israeli [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  proposals. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, somebody who said that on this stage was Jared Kushner. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  He said that the deals weren't actually very well fleshed out. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  The first one that actually had a detailed map, he says, was his. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=657.12s)]
*  But even, you know, Olmert says, you know, I had actually come close to an agreement [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=661.36s)]
*  with Abu Mazen, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  He was willing, for example, to give up on the right of return, except for a small token [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=672.24s)]
*  number. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=677.12s)]
*  I wanted 5,000 Palestinians to come back. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=678.12s)]
*  He wanted 50,000, but nobody was talking about 5 million. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=680.82s)]
*  And because then Olmert was, you know, no longer going to be prime minister, they didn't [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=685.38s)]
*  feel that that was the right time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=689.7800000000001s)]
*  But the point is that it seems like your description of the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=692.6600000000001s)]
*  is much vaster than the empirical reality. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=699.38s)]
*  What am I getting wrong? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=703.1800000000001s)]
*  So, a few things that I noticed. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=704.98s)]
*  The first is, if what you describe was true, you would have seen Palestinian leaders, Palestinian [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=708.16s)]
*  intellectuals, first of all saying, these were good proposals, we missed an opportunity. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=717.48s)]
*  You wouldn't see voices that says, we should have said yes, or we need to go back and say [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=725.04s)]
*  yes. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  There were no such voices, and there are still no such voices. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  The other thing is, fundamentally, people who want a state, if that is their absolute [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=734.96s)]
*  top priority, and they are presented with the opportunity to do so, they say yes. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=742.84s)]
*  They take it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  They follow up. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  They add specificity. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  But fundamentally, they go for it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=753.48s)]
*  And what we saw is a walking away. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=756.48s)]
*  And by the way, Abu Mazen himself said to Condoleezza Rice, I can't tell at the time [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=759.14s)]
*  it was four million refugees that they're not going home. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=764.3000000000001s)]
*  So maybe he wanted to sign. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  Contrary to the image that the leaders are more extreme than the people, historically [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=771.86s)]
*  it's been the opposite. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=776.3000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he thought it might be a good deal, but he knew that at the end of the day, he [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=777.9s)]
*  has no people to go back to. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=781.86s)]
*  And again, the empirical evidence is that there were no voices telling him to do that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=784.4200000000001s)]
*  It didn't matter that Ulmert and this government was maybe not stable because the Americans [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=790.54s)]
*  guaranteed it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=796.74s)]
*  This was part of a process. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=797.74s)]
*  Again, people who want a state say yes. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=799.26s)]
*  As I did the research for the book, I came across a quote that I've been using ever since [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=803.02s)]
*  because I found that it explained everything. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=808.42s)]
*  And talk about Occam's razor. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=811.74s)]
*  If you have a simple explanation, and it actually explains everything, then why go in other ways? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=814.14s)]
*  It's by Ernst Bevin, the British foreign minister after World War II. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=820.9s)]
*  If you know anything about Ernst Bevin, he was not a friend to the Jewish people, certainly [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  not to Jews who sought sovereignty. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=828.98s)]
*  And in February of 47, he goes to the British parliament to explain to the people of Britain [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=831.5s)]
*  why Britain essentially failed to fulfill the mandate. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=836.6s)]
*  It did not fail the mandate of Iraq, of Jordan. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=840.38s)]
*  It created them, but it failed to fulfill the mandate in Palestine to help the Jews [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=843.42s)]
*  achieve sovereignty. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=848.02s)]
*  And he needs to explain why. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=849.02s)]
*  And this is February 47, and it's important. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=850.62s)]
*  He says, his majesty's government is thus faced with an irreconcilable conflict. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=853.74s)]
*  He calls it irreconcilable in February 47. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=859.62s)]
*  There are no settlements. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=863.66s)]
*  There's no occupation. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=865.1s)]
*  There's no refugees. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=867.02s)]
*  There's no Gaza Strip. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=868.66s)]
*  There's no blockade. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=869.72s)]
*  All of the things that we are told are the causes of the conflict don't exist yet. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=870.88s)]
*  And he already calls it irreconcilable. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=877.52s)]
*  And he goes on to say, look, in the land between the river and the sea, there are two peoples. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=880.44s)]
*  So it's understood that those are peoples, not faiths, not religions, Jews and Arabs. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  And each one of them has a top priority, the point of principle. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=890.5s)]
*  He says, for the Jews, the top priority is to establish a Jewish state. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=893.64s)]
*  So the Jews want a state based on the principle of self-determination for their people in [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=898.12s)]
*  their homeland. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=903.32s)]
*  And then he goes on to say, for the Arabs, the top priority is to prevent to the last [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=904.64s)]
*  the establishment of a Jewish state in any part of the land. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=910.6s)]
*  He doesn't say the Jews want a state, the Arabs want a state. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=915.2s)]
*  We'd love the help of the UN in delineating a border. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=919.44s)]
*  He says, as a matter of top priority, the Jews want a state and the Arabs want the Jews [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=922.6s)]
*  not to have a state. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=928.28s)]
*  And this has been the best predictor of the behavior of the sides ever since. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=930.24s)]
*  OK, this is really interesting. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  So 1947 was 77 years ago. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=937.04s)]
*  And I think one would be justified in saying that what the Arabs wanted back then is very [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  different from what the Arabs want now. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=955.04s)]
*  So if you look at what the Palestinians said about Camp David 2000, about the Clinton parameters, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=958.04s)]
*  about the Barack, the Olmert deal in particular, they make very specific claims. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=966.04s)]
*  They don't say the problem with this deal was that there continued to be a Jewish state. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=971.64s)]
*  With Camp David 2000, they argue about the map. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=977.56s)]
*  Dennis Ross, in his book, says, here's the map we offered. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=981.24s)]
*  The Palestinians say, no, no, no, you offered us a much worse map. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=983.84s)]
*  And they have. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=987.24s)]
*  So that, to me, is a rational disagreement about the material thing that was being offered. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=988.24s)]
*  The same thing about when the Palestinians walked away from the deal that was proposed [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=995.24s)]
*  by Olmert. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1000.44s)]
*  The fact of the matter is they say, and they still say to the state, there wasn't a map. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1002.76s)]
*  They don't say the Jews insisted on having their sovereign state, et cetera. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  So I guess you're certainly right that the conflict has been irreconcilable, or has not [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1013.6s)]
*  yet been reconciled. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1022.6s)]
*  But the reasons for that have changed over time. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1024.48s)]
*  So my view is try to think empathetically here. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1027.68s)]
*  So I'm also quite aware of the argument I'm about to make, being made by a guy with my [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1033.0s)]
*  name and appearance. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1036.94s)]
*  People will think I'm opposed to Israel, so I'm not. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1038.08s)]
*  If you're an Arab living in what is then part of Greater Syria, part of the Ottoman Empire [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  and near Jerusalem, and suddenly there are these Jews who everybody believes, even Muslims [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1048.56s)]
*  believe have a connection to this terror, but they're now coming in large numbers from [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1055.62s)]
*  foreign countries, it's just a natural tendency of these people to think, hey, I don't want [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1060.12s)]
*  this immigration to happen. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1064.36s)]
*  In the United States, people are opposed to immigration. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1067.68s)]
*  And so it feels like you're taking what is a very natural tendency to a group of, you [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  know, that any group of people might feel to an influx of immigrants, and you're reading [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1078.76s)]
*  into it this endless eternal opposition to any kind of Jewish presence or Jewish sovereignty [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1083.24s)]
*  in any part of this land. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  And I feel like in 2024, that's not what the issue is. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1091.68s)]
*  So I will make the case that it is. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'll go back to where I said. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1098.6s)]
*  First of all, when I say that this is the conflict, I'm not making a judgment. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1100.16s)]
*  This is a description. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1106.52s)]
*  I clearly would like the conflict to end with a Jewish state remaining and thriving, and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1107.8000000000002s)]
*  part of the land at least. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1113.64s)]
*  But when I say that this conflict is between the Jews wanting a state and the Arabs wanting [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1115.92s)]
*  the Jews not to have a state, this is a description. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1121.8400000000001s)]
*  What I find fascinating, so I'm not saying that, okay, this side, each side believes [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  that they're right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1132.8s)]
*  So for example, when I make that case on social media, no one from the Arab side, maybe some [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1133.8s)]
*  Jews, but no one from the Arab side will ever disprove this argument. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1141.3200000000002s)]
*  They will dig deeper. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1147.76s)]
*  They will say that Zionism is colonialism and racism and apartheid and white European. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1149.04s)]
*  They will justify their position, why the Jews should not have a state, but they will [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1154.32s)]
*  not say, what are you talking about? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1159.0s)]
*  Our only problem is with the settlements. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1161.84s)]
*  Even all the arguments that you said, there was a map, there wasn't a map. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1165.16s)]
*  None of them are arguments that say what we should have said yes to is this, or the only [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1169.84s)]
*  thing that was standing between us and an agreement was that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1176.8s)]
*  They dispute certain elements, but they don't ultimately say this is our vision. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1181.92s)]
*  And as you know, it's not that it was in 47 and nothing happened since. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1187.3200000000002s)]
*  Every year since 47, the rejection of partition, the going to war, the maintaining of perpetual [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1193.3200000000002s)]
*  refugeehood, unlike all other conflicts, creating this idea of a right of return, which has [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1201.52s)]
*  become essentially the best indicator to know whether there is an agreement to a Jewish [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1208.26s)]
*  state or not. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1214.7s)]
*  And you actually cannot find a single moment since 47 to the present where there is a clear [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1216.62s)]
*  Palestinian vision of peace in which the Jewish state is standing. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1225.02s)]
*  So this is marked by a clear declaration that the perpetual refugeehood is over and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1231.62s)]
*  that there is no right of return into the sovereign territory of Israel. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1238.34s)]
*  So this is missing, meaning that again, if you look at the entire span, there was indeed [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1243.4199999999998s)]
*  a consistent rejection of a sovereign Jewish state. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1250.1399999999999s)]
*  So for example, during all the years of negotiations, when Palestinian leaders said to states, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1254.34s)]
*  what we didn't hear or listen is that they continue to argue, even Abu Mazen, that the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1261.86s)]
*  right of return is holy, sacred, non-negotiable, belongs to every Palestinian in perpetuity. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1267.74s)]
*  So if you put two and two, saying two states plus the right of return says an Arab state [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1275.54s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza and another Arab state to replace Israel. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1282.1799999999998s)]
*  Again, there's no Jewish state anywhere. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1285.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1287.94s)]
*  Well, okay, this is really important. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1288.94s)]
*  I mean, because the crux of the matter is you're saying because Palestinians continue [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1290.22s)]
*  to insist on a right of return to the places from which they left and or were expelled [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1296.74s)]
*  in 1948, that basically means that they want to, if the right of return were exercised, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1303.98s)]
*  they would be a majority, there would be no Jewish state. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1311.5s)]
*  I will say one piece of data that I think supports your proposition and several pieces [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1315.22s)]
*  of data that I think lead us to doubt it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1322.38s)]
*  So one thing you will definitely notice if you look at some of the discourse around October [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1327.18s)]
*  7th and in some of the Hamas channels, when they talk about the inhabitants of southern [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1331.58s)]
*  Israel who were killed or kidnapped, they refer to them as settlers, which I think [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1341.46s)]
*  validates your perspective. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1346.3s)]
*  The argument I would make is that is not a mainstream or necessarily a mainstream view [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1348.6200000000001s)]
*  among Palestinians. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1355.18s)]
*  And so why do I, Tariq Massoud, say that? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1356.74s)]
*  Here's why I say that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1358.9s)]
*  Number one, we know that Yasser Arafat recognized the state of Israel. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1360.26s)]
*  We know that Abu Mazen said, I'm never going to go back to Safed, where I'm from. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1364.66s)]
*  For me, the Palestinian state is the 1967 borders and the state of Israel is the state [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1371.38s)]
*  of Israel within the 1967 borders. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1378.3400000000001s)]
*  So then we also know that there's decades of polling data where the Palestinian support [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1381.1000000000001s)]
*  for a two-state solution definitely ebbs and flows. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1389.46s)]
*  The last time it was a majority of Palestinians wanting two states side by side was 2014. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1392.7s)]
*  But the point is, if you look during Oslo, and I know you paid a lot of more attention [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1399.06s)]
*  to Oslo than I did at that time, lots of Palestinians supported this idea. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1403.42s)]
*  Let's be done with this conflict. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1408.22s)]
*  And you're right that nobody has said, we are going to sign away the right of return. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1411.5800000000002s)]
*  That has never happened. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1419.94s)]
*  Every Palestinian I have ever spoken to says to me, Tariq, that's our only negotiating [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1423.6s)]
*  card. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1428.9599999999998s)]
*  It's actually in UN resolution 194, from 1948. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1429.9599999999998s)]
*  I can't remember what year that was, 48 or 47. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1433.9199999999998s)]
*  Resolution 194, 48, that says that the people who were expelled from their homes should [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1437.0s)]
*  be allowed to go back and return to their homes or be paid compensation. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1443.4399999999998s)]
*  So if I'm a Palestinian, I got nothing. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1447.98s)]
*  I don't have an army. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't even have decent leaders. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1451.28s)]
*  I do have this right that the United Nations says I have. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1454.16s)]
*  I'm not going to give that up before I even show up at the negotiating table. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1459.24s)]
*  But at the end, and again, this is what we saw Abou Mazen saying, at the end, we'll make [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1463.32s)]
*  a deal and yeah, we'll say symbolic right of return for 50,000 people. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1468.0s)]
*  And then Palestinians can celebrate. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  Look, Palestinians are never going to forget that they belong to this land, just like the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1476.56s)]
*  Jewish people never forgot that they belong to this land. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1482.0s)]
*  But nobody's going to exercise or try to exercise anything because these two states will have [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1484.56s)]
*  come to a deal. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1488.88s)]
*  And to the extent that a right of return persists after that, it will just be some spiritual [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1490.68s)]
*  thing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1496.72s)]
*  So that's what I thought. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1497.72s)]
*  And it was a legitimate thought in the 90s. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1499.72s)]
*  It was a legitimate idea in the 90s that the idea of return, and it's important to emphasize, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1502.6s)]
*  it's actually not a legal right. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1508.84s)]
*  Resolution 194 does not create it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1511.48s)]
*  It was a proposal for peace, which the Arabs, of course, rejected, then taking one subsection, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1514.9599999999998s)]
*  giving it an extreme interpretation. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1521.32s)]
*  But it's not, if only for the obvious reason that UN General Assembly resolutions don't [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1522.9599999999998s)]
*  give rights. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1527.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not a legal right by any means. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1528.6799999999998s)]
*  But you're right that Palestinians believe it is. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1531.22s)]
*  But you could say in the 90s, that was the view of the peace camp. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1534.0600000000002s)]
*  That was the view of the negotiators. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1537.46s)]
*  This is ultimately a bargaining chip. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1539.42s)]
*  When the Palestinians will have an opportunity to bargain that away for a state, sovereignty, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1542.26s)]
*  independence, they will bargain it away for a state, which is their priority. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1550.3s)]
*  And what we saw twice, that they bargained away the state in order to keep fighting for [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1555.62s)]
*  this idea of return, which is mostly an indicator, again, of no Jewish state. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1562.4199999999998s)]
*  So by now, we need to deal with the empirical proof that they have walked away. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1567.86s)]
*  They did not treat it as a bargaining chip. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1575.1399999999999s)]
*  Even Abu Mazen, when he in an interview said that he himself does not plan to go and live [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1578.9399999999998s)]
*  in Sfat and Safed, I don't know if you know, but his son and grandson immediately went [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1585.34s)]
*  to YouTube. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1591.26s)]
*  Ironically, they're the ones who were not born there and say, we are going to return. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1592.26s)]
*  And Abu Mazen immediately also clarified that that is a personal decision, thereby, again, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1596.4599999999998s)]
*  emphasizing that it is a right that belongs to every individual in perpetuity. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1604.5s)]
*  So we're now in a point that if we actually want to get to peace and we understand that [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1610.02s)]
*  this is the core issue, and it is, because contrary to what you're saying, when Arafat [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1615.5s)]
*  recognized Israel, he recognized Israel as it exists, but continued to insist on this [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1621.3s)]
*  idea of return. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1625.94s)]
*  So to recognize that Israel exists and insist on return is, again, to deny the Jewish right [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1627.46s)]
*  to self-determination. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1632.98s)]
*  There was no acknowledgment of that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1633.98s)]
*  And again, by now we have enough experience that we know what to look for. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1637.52s)]
*  So in order to get to peace, we first have to remove that obstacle because we will never [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1641.58s)]
*  have an agreement as long as the vision is that there cannot be a Jewish right. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1647.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1653.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1654.72s)]
*  I think with this part of the conversation, we've probably gotten to a point where our [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1655.72s)]
*  interpretations of certain historical episodes are at odds. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1660.32s)]
*  And so what people need to do is try to figure out how to adjudicate between our interpretations. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1664.84s)]
*  So your interpretation of Palestinians walking away from deals is that they were so wedded [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1670.0s)]
*  to this idea of insisting on dismantling the Jewish state through return that you could [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1676.22s)]
*  have offered them everything and they would never have taken it, everything in West Bank [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1683.24s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1687.1999999999998s)]
*  And I'm saying, no, the reason they walked away from the deals is because the deals weren't [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1688.26s)]
*  very specific and that in fact there is still some scope for an agreement. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1692.32s)]
*  And I think basically people are going to have to do some research to determine which [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1698.9199999999998s)]
*  of us is correct. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1703.76s)]
*  I would just say one more thing. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1704.76s)]
*  I'm not making just a historical case. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1706.48s)]
*  I'm making that case every day in the present. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  When people tell me, you're painting a broad brush, this is a generalization, Palestinians [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1712.2s)]
*  accept the equal right of the Jewish people to self-determination in their land. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1719.56s)]
*  They understand there will not be a return. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  I always tell people, if you think I'm wrong, not in the past, now, because it's every day, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1726.08s)]
*  then I say go, go and find Palestinians who publicly and will specifically say, we recognize [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1733.0s)]
*  the equal right of the Jewish people as a people to self-determination in their historic [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1741.52s)]
*  homeland. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1746.76s)]
*  We want to live next to the Jewish state of Israel rather than instead of it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1747.76s)]
*  We understand this means we're not refugees and we do not possess a right of return into [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1751.68s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1756.32s)]
*  And as I said, over 20 years, I found three. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1757.32s)]
*  Well, my view is, look, on both sides here, we have people who may hold to a very expansive [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1760.84s)]
*  or maximalist view of what they are entitled to. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1770.96s)]
*  So I definitely think it is the case that some Palestinians believe that they should [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1775.28s)]
*  return to what is Israel proper. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1781.36s)]
*  My very strong sense from talking to Palestinians to seeing polling data, et cetera, is that [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1784.04s)]
*  very few actually believe that they're going to go by the millions into Israel and totally [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1789.8s)]
*  change the character of this country. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1797.28s)]
*  But, well, I mean, but you know, your test is, you know, do they speak publicly, et cetera? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1800.64s)]
*  I don't know, this is an authoritarian society. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  There's all kinds of reasons why you might. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1808.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I think just the other day I had a Palestinian who said, no, none of [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1810.64s)]
*  us thinks that we're going to go back. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1817.0s)]
*  But you know, to what I just told you, I'm literally just channeling what Palestinians [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1820.2s)]
*  The idea that we would just give up this card that has some international legitimacy from [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1826.0800000000002s)]
*  Resolution 194. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1831.8s)]
*  And you know, you might be right that it doesn't have the force of law. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  But the reason I, for example, believe in the legitimacy of the state of Israel is because [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1837.0800000000002s)]
*  it was recognized by the same body, the United Nations, that passed that resolution. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1842.24s)]
*  So the idea for Palestinians, like, why should I give this up at the outset? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1846.96s)]
*  But of course, we all recognize that it's not going to be exercised. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1850.76s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1853.24s)]
*  On the Israeli side, there are also people who believe in a right of return, not just [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1855.56s)]
*  to the state of Israel within the borders that you and I would both recognize, but also [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1860.8s)]
*  to what in Israel is called Judea and Samaria. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1866.32s)]
*  This is the West Bank. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1869.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1871.0s)]
*  And those people, these are the settlers, those people are actually aided and abetted [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1872.0s)]
*  by the Israeli government. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1876.92s)]
*  The Israeli government is annexing land. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1878.4s)]
*  The Israeli government is supporting these settlers. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1880.28s)]
*  So how about talking about those people and that right of return as an obstacle to peace? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1882.76s)]
*  First of all, again, that's not a right of return. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1889.44s)]
*  They're settling there, not in the name of any right. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1892.12s)]
*  Again, the idea of right of return is very specific and was created in a very specific way. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1895.08s)]
*  I have repeatedly said, again, I think the settlements have been Israel's most wasteful [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1901.48s)]
*  project. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1907.12s)]
*  I have written a series of essays calling for Israel to delineate a clear border, even [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1908.12s)]
*  not withdraw, I sometimes call it yes to the occupation, no to the settlements, essentially [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1917.4399999999998s)]
*  not withdraw the military as long as there is a state of war, but no need to expand settlements. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  The difference at the end of the day, and that goes again to the core of the conflict, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1931.6399999999999s)]
*  is the numerical imbalance. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1937.44s)]
*  The Jewish people, as long as we care about being sovereign in this land of Israel, which [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1940.28s)]
*  we do, we are destined or damned, choose your word, to remain a tiny, tiny, puny, ethnic, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1946.76s)]
*  linguistic, national, religious minority in an Arab and Muslim Middle East. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1956.2s)]
*  The seventh century conquests were hugely successful, well done. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1961.6s)]
*  We will always remain a minority. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1965.72s)]
*  Sometimes I tell the story that when Israel declares independence in 1948, the ratio of [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1969.6200000000001s)]
*  Jews to Arabs in the region is 1 to 50, 5-0. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1974.48s)]
*  So Ben-Gurion calls on Jews from all over the world to immigrate to the nation states, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1978.4s)]
*  it's a huge success, more than 3 million Jews come in Israel's existence. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1983.0800000000002s)]
*  He calls on Jews to make a lot of babies, also great success, Israel is the most fertile [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1987.98s)]
*  OECD country. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1993.0s)]
*  We are more than 10 times the number of Jews we were when we declared independence. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1994.64s)]
*  The ratio of Jews to Arabs in the region today, 1 to 60. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  So they've been busy too. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2003.3200000000002s)]
*  And essentially there's... [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2004.92s)]
*  It's a very romantic region. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2006.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2009.8000000000002s)]
*  So there's essentially no amount of immigration or procreation that would ever get the Jews [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2010.8000000000002s)]
*  out of their minority status in the region. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  Which is why the Jews repeatedly agree to some measures of partition. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2020.58s)]
*  Again, not because I don't believe in moral, good, bad and international relations. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2026.98s)]
*  Simply because we're small, we understand our situation as being small. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2033.54s)]
*  And this is why right-wing governments and left-wing governments always agree whenever [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2038.86s)]
*  there's even an opening, agree to various schemes of land for peace, partition, agreements. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2043.92s)]
*  Because again, we're small and... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2051.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2053.84s)]
*  But I guess, you know, so you're agreeing with me though that settlements are not helping [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2054.84s)]
*  the matter. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course they're not helping the matter. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2059.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'm also very clear that with a peace opportunity, we will always say yes. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2062.16s)]
*  And I will even say more than that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2068.88s)]
*  Again, I am not supportive of it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2072.04s)]
*  I can consistently write about delineating a border. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2074.56s)]
*  But we can show a few things empirically. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2078.8799999999997s)]
*  We can show a few things that settlements are not the reason we do not have peace. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2082.16s)]
*  Again, there was no settlements essentially until the mid-70s. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2088.9199999999996s)]
*  And you have already decades of clear and consistent opposition to a Jewish state. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2093.8799999999997s)]
*  The nature of the conflict was different then. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2100.8s)]
*  It involved other Arab countries. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2102.6000000000004s)]
*  The Palestinians didn't have... [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2104.1200000000003s)]
*  They had no kind of self-determination or ability to chart their own course. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2105.96s)]
*  As I'm sure you know, if you look at the maps of the PLO, it's hard to find them between [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2110.2000000000003s)]
*  64 and 67. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2114.44s)]
*  If you look at the logo, the Palestine they seek to liberate is Israel within its 67. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2116.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2122.96s)]
*  But even after that, we talked... [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2124.24s)]
*  Barack, Clinton parameters, and Ulmert, they offer a state without settlements and they [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2127.3199999999997s)]
*  still walk away. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2134.56s)]
*  So that's not the reason. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2135.56s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2138.2799999999997s)]
*  And just... [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2140.08s)]
*  And again, Israel has demonstrated its ability, I agree, is stupid to build and then dismantle. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2141.08s)]
*  But Israel has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to ruthlessly dismantle settlements [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2147.56s)]
*  for peace and even much less than that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2153.66s)]
*  And we will do so again for peace. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2156.48s)]
*  But we want to know that it's peace. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2160.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2161.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's a very helpful thing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  I will say two things. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2163.88s)]
*  You have more faith, I guess, in the current configuration of the Israeli government in [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2166.08s)]
*  its willingness to... [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  I see it as dramatically expanding settlements in the West Bank, annexing land, et cetera. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2174.12s)]
*  We know that Netanyahu at one point wanted to annex basically all of Area C. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2181.56s)]
*  So this is a great example, if you allow me. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2186.64s)]
*  Sir, can I just finish the point? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2188.52s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2189.7999999999997s)]
*  Because one of the... [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2190.7999999999997s)]
*  When I first became an admirer of Annette Welf, it was because she wrote an article [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2192.2799999999997s)]
*  in the Atlantic after President Trump had decided to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2196.64s)]
*  And you said, I wish he had said that we are moving the U.S. embassy to West Jerusalem. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2205.52s)]
*  Because just as Annette Welf believed that the Palestinians need to give up on the idea [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2212.72s)]
*  that they can move to the West, Jews need to give up on the idea that they can have [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2218.96s)]
*  And East Jerusalem should be the Palestinian capital, et cetera. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2225.8799999999997s)]
*  And I thought that was extremely wise. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2229.3599999999997s)]
*  It is exactly what I think. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2232.16s)]
*  And when I'm now asking you about the fact that the Israeli government has not been listening [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2234.9199999999996s)]
*  to you, your response is to say, well, but that's not the cause of this problem. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2240.62s)]
*  And we're not doing political science here. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2246.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't know how much... [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2249.16s)]
*  What the coefficient on that particular term in the regression is. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2250.7799999999997s)]
*  But clearly you've got to admit that that's part of the problem. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2254.84s)]
*  And then the question is, okay, what's the solution to that problem? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2259.36s)]
*  We've got a lot of people in Israel who think they have some spiritual right of return to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2262.28s)]
*  Judea and Samaria. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2267.8s)]
*  And I think Annette Welf would say, yeah, those people can have those crazy views. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2269.5s)]
*  If we come to a deal with the Palestinians and we enforce it, we're going to have some [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2274.32s)]
*  of those people kicking around who still think that, but they're not going to be able to [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2279.1000000000004s)]
*  act on it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2282.28s)]
*  And what I'm saying is that could also happen on the Palestinian side. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2283.8s)]
*  There will be from now to the end of time, some Palestinians who say, oh, I should be [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2286.84s)]
*  able to go back to wherever, or whatever. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  But they're not going to be able to. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2295.7200000000003s)]
*  We don't need, in other words, to have every single person, every single Palestinian become [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2298.1200000000003s)]
*  a Zionist in order to have peace with these people. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2304.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2307.8s)]
*  So I need to go back to a few things. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2308.8s)]
*  So first, you know what, let's go from, you know what, let's talk about the biblical [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2312.44s)]
*  idea and all that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2318.56s)]
*  Sometimes people say, oh, what can you do? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2320.28s)]
*  Those are people who are motivated by ideas of God, religion, connection to the land. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2323.16s)]
*  And I always tell them, notice how there is biblical land in the Sinai. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2328.32s)]
*  There is biblical land in Lebanon. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2333.94s)]
*  There's biblical land in Syria. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2335.68s)]
*  There's certainly biblical land in Trans-Georgia. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2337.0s)]
*  But in Syria, they have the kingdom. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2338.0s)]
*  There's biblical land in areas A and B. And yet somehow, by magic, they do not rely on [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2340.28s)]
*  the Bible or God. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2346.96s)]
*  They rely on where the Israeli defense forces actually control the ability to defend them. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2348.44s)]
*  So the settlers do not go to places where the IDF does not control. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2355.0400000000004s)]
*  So when people... [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2363.0800000000004s)]
*  But they would love the IDF to control all of it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2364.0800000000004s)]
*  Do you want me to quote what Smoczor just said this week? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2365.6400000000003s)]
*  But this is why, for example, when the IDF gets out of Sinai, when the IDF gets out of [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2369.0s)]
*  Gaza, when the IDF gets out of the northern West Bank, there are no settlers left. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2373.68s)]
*  So I look at empirical proof, not at ideas. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2379.12s)]
*  And empirically, Israel has demonstrated repeatedly its ability, and I say it's stupid to build [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2382.3599999999997s)]
*  and then remove, but to ruthlessly remove settlements for the cause of peace and much [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2389.0s)]
*  less. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2395.0s)]
*  The Palestinians are yet to take one refugee off the roster, do something that rolls back [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2396.0s)]
*  the notion of from the river to the sea. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2405.16s)]
*  And to your question about they do not all need to become Zionists, but sometimes people [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2408.68s)]
*  think, what? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2415.8s)]
*  This is a crazy idea. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2416.8s)]
*  But I say it's basic. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2418.04s)]
*  For me to be considered someone who wants peace, I need and I do recognize the equal [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2420.8s)]
*  right of the Palestinians to self-determination in their homeland. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2427.44s)]
*  Why is it that expecting Palestinians to recognize the equal right of the Jewish people to self-determination [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2432.36s)]
*  in their historic homeland, aka Zionism, why is that suddenly such a crazy ask? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2440.88s)]
*  For me, that is the essence of how we make peace. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2447.4s)]
*  I think if your definition of Zionism is recognizing that the Jewish people, the people of the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2451.08s)]
*  state of Israel, however you want to define them, have a right to their country, I think [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2457.6s)]
*  that's much easier than you're making it out to be. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2462.28s)]
*  And I think that it's already a practical reality. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2465.2s)]
*  But I think this is, you know, we're not going to settle this between us. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2470.92s)]
*  I do think there's a couple of other things I want to get to and then I want to, in order [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2477.2400000000002s)]
*  to preserve my life and limb, I do have to open it up to the audience. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2481.56s)]
*  So you know, the others, you know, when we talk about, we're talking about obstacles [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2484.76s)]
*  to peace and you know, your big claim that you've been making is this Palestinian refusal [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2488.96s)]
*  to reconcile itself with the presence of Jewish sovereignty is a big obstacle to peace. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2494.76s)]
*  And we've been arguing back and forth about the settlements as an obstacle to peace. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2501.4s)]
*  Another obstacle to peace that, another person I think is an obstacle to peace is your Prime [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2505.16s)]
*  Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2510.72s)]
*  And I'm going to confess, actually, this is somebody I used to have some admiration for. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2512.3599999999997s)]
*  I thought his economic ideas were pretty good and I even had a kind of grudging admiration [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2516.72s)]
*  of him as a kind of very stalwart defender of his country's national interest. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2521.3999999999996s)]
*  But you know, leave aside the catastrophic failure that happened on his government's [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2529.76s)]
*  watch on October 7th, which just nobody I talked to can even understand how that could [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2535.1600000000003s)]
*  happen except at the hands of a government with Middle Eastern levels of incompetence. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2543.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2549.4s)]
*  But we also know that your Prime Minister, you know, who is now waging a war in Gaza [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2551.7200000000003s)]
*  that has cost 30,000 civilian lives. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2559.12s)]
*  He says all of these civilian casualties are necessary because we are dealing with the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2562.92s)]
*  new Nazis. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2570.12s)]
*  And yet we know, it's reported in the Israeli press, that Netanyahu encouraged the Qataris [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2571.96s)]
*  to provide funding to Hamas. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2579.52s)]
*  He has been on record in a Likud party conference saying that my job is to prevent the emergence [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2582.24s)]
*  of a Palestinian state and if you want to do that, then you have to support funding [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2587.7s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2591.54s)]
*  So now your people have to pay the cost of that on October 7th and the Palestinian people [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2592.54s)]
*  have to pay the cost of that. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2597.98s)]
*  How much of the blame for this catastrophe that we're in right now belongs to somebody [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2600.3799999999997s)]
*  like Benjamin Netanyahu, who every single move he has been making has been an obstacle [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2604.7s)]
*  to peace? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2610.1s)]
*  So first, just a small correction. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2611.1s)]
*  Out of the number, we don't know how many are civilians and how many combatants. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2613.7799999999997s)]
*  I will go with the Israeli number. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2617.02s)]
*  The Israelis say 13,000 are combatants. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2618.54s)]
*  Fine. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2621.94s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2622.94s)]
*  I'm just saying one thing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2623.94s)]
*  The one thing I will completely not forgive Netanyahu after October 7th is that he has, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2627.2200000000003s)]
*  you talked about Middle Eastern levels of incompetence. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2636.46s)]
*  He has dismantled brick by brick what Israel needs to survive in the region because Israel [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2640.02s)]
*  does not have a scenario by which it gently slides into third world or local regional [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2649.98s)]
*  incompetence. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2657.7s)]
*  As soon as we begin our dissent, we get slaughtered because fundamentally there is still opposition [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2659.18s)]
*  to our very existence as a sovereign state. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2669.9s)]
*  So what he did is he essentially gutted everything that made Israel excellent, from politics [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2671.86s)]
*  to the civil service to science to education. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2683.34s)]
*  And the notion that the Jewish states could somehow go through that and survive is the [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2688.14s)]
*  one we're living through. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2696.34s)]
*  Now specifically on his policy on Hamas, this is something, and unfortunately it's not just [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2697.98s)]
*  him, it would be so easy if it were just him. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2704.18s)]
*  There were so many people who refused to engage with the Palestinian ideology and to understand [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2711.62s)]
*  that we can never move forward without that ideology changing. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2722.5600000000004s)]
*  And a lot of people were under the impression that you can bribe people away from what they [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  believe is a noble cause. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2735.04s)]
*  And this is for years I've been going and meeting with people and telling them this [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2739.8s)]
*  Because on the other side, there is a total ideology that will never just bribe the way [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2746.04s)]
*  You're talking about Hamas? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2752.52s)]
*  I thought we were talking about Hamas, but you keep saying Palestinian ideology. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2754.8s)]
*  If there was a Palestinian ideology of which Hamas was just an example, then we wouldn't [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2757.92s)]
*  have had the division between Hamas and Fatah. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2762.7599999999998s)]
*  They clearly have different visions for this polity. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2765.88s)]
*  Hamas doesn't want to coexist with Israel. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2768.8s)]
*  Fatah, the PLO, we can argue about it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2771.16s)]
*  They've definitely negotiated over it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2774.08s)]
*  So I guess I'm confused. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2777.16s)]
*  I thought we were talking about Netanyahu supporting Hamas and you're saying, no, no, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2779.04s)]
*  the problem is what? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2783.2s)]
*  First of all, the idea that Hamas is some kind of alien force. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2786.4s)]
*  Not alien, right wing, hard right. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2791.04s)]
*  And Netanyahu supported them and thereby preventing or making it hard and he gave them resources [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2794.6s)]
*  and consequently made it possible for them to look before October 7th, there were protests [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2802.1200000000003s)]
*  in Gaza against Hamas's poor governance. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2807.1600000000003s)]
*  Those protests might have come years earlier had Netanyahu not been handing the money in [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  suitcases. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2814.48s)]
*  I think a lot of things could have happened years earlier, but I want to take it in a [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2815.56s)]
*  few elements. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2820.36s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2821.36s)]
*  Hamas is the most brutal executor of this ideology, but fundamentally it remains the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2822.36s)]
*  Palestinian ideology of no Jewish state. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2830.84s)]
*  It's not disconnected. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2833.6000000000004s)]
*  Hamas came from that, the notion that it can be distanced, that it's separate, that it [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2835.8s)]
*  doesn't represent. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2842.0s)]
*  I even noticed you tried here and no, it actually does. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2844.04s)]
*  You see it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2849.36s)]
*  People are not condemning October 7th. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2850.36s)]
*  They're not distancing themselves. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2852.48s)]
*  Wait, sorry, what did I try? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2854.04s)]
*  What did you say I just tried? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2856.28s)]
*  I tried to tell one of the speakers here to say that it's separate. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2857.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, gotcha. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2860.84s)]
*  Even she didn't. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2861.84s)]
*  So I think indeed the fact that there was not sufficient appreciation that this ideology [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2862.84s)]
*  is real, it's deeply held, and that people are going to divert the resources to execute [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2872.4s)]
*  it is for me a massive failure, which I wish was only his. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2879.92s)]
*  I have jokingly, half jokingly tweeted when people said he prevented a Palestinian state, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2886.0s)]
*  I half jokingly tweeted that it's not nice to take credit for the one achievement of [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2893.44s)]
*  the Palestinian movement because it's essentially he can claim it all he want. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2897.36s)]
*  But again, I look at empirical behavior and even right-wing governments are right-wing [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2904.0s)]
*  governments of a small people. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2909.4s)]
*  So you talked about the annexation. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2911.68s)]
*  And I remember about three years ago when people talked about Netanyahu wanting to annex [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2914.16s)]
*  and everyone talked about annexation and Israel wanted to annex. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2918.56s)]
*  And then the Emirati ambassador to the US writes an op-ed in an Israeli paper essentially [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2922.3199999999997s)]
*  saying how about you drop this annexation and you'll get direct flights to Dubai. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2928.3999999999996s)]
*  And Israelis were like, yay. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2935.2s)]
*  And yeah, there were like five settlers who were like, oh, this was a terribly missed [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2937.64s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2941.7999999999997s)]
*  And again, you have revealed preferences. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2942.96s)]
*  The revealed preferences of the people of Israel, even under a right-wing government [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2945.52s)]
*  is- [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2950.28s)]
*  Go to Dubai? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2951.28s)]
*  Oh, are you kidding? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2952.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2953.28s)]
*  And people went so- [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2954.28s)]
*  What does that have to do with the Palestinians is what I'm trying to understand. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2955.28s)]
*  Because when faced with a choice, ultimately as a people and as individuals, you reveal [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2958.96s)]
*  yourself when you are faced with choices. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2966.48s)]
*  And when the choice was between annexation and normalization, it was clear that Israelis [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2969.64s)]
*  prefer normalization. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2975.44s)]
*  And the revealed preferences are again and again for normalization, for partition, for [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2977.52s)]
*  removing settlements if it allows for peace. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2983.3599999999997s)]
*  Again, not because we're good or nice or moral, because we're a minority. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  Can I say one thing? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2989.96s)]
*  So by the way, I definitely agree with you on what I think the mainstream Israeli desire, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2991.08s)]
*  the mainstream Israeli opinion is. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=2998.56s)]
*  But you know, I just think you're not giving enough credit to the Palestinians. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3000.64s)]
*  So the Hamas Charter, if you can read 1988, terrible document, but Hamas offered a kind [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3005.44s)]
*  of addendum to it in 2018. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3011.36s)]
*  And lots of people say, you know, this is where Hamas accepts a two-state solution. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3014.08s)]
*  I frankly don't think that's where Hamas accepts a two-state solution. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3019.52s)]
*  What Hamas says in that document is basically, we don't think there should be Jewish sovereignty [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3023.12s)]
*  etc. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3028.4s)]
*  However, we agree to two states because this is the Palestinian consensus. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3029.4s)]
*  So even Hamas is saying in that 2018 document that Palestinians in general have come to [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3038.28s)]
*  this view that we should just live in our state alongside the Jewish state, which again [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3045.4s)]
*  suggests to me... [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3050.64s)]
*  No, they don't say that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3051.64s)]
*  They say plus the right of return. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3052.64s)]
*  They even say that in their declarations now. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3053.64s)]
*  Well, I guess what I'm just trying to get to is that you have a particular description [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3056.72s)]
*  of what the Palestinian position is. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3063.8799999999997s)]
*  And we don't have very good polling data, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3066.16s)]
*  the Palestinians have come to terms with the fact that there is a Jewish state that they [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3072.56s)]
*  will have to live alongside. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3077.6s)]
*  Do they have to like it? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3078.6s)]
*  Do they have to actually sign on to all of the principles of Zionism? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3080.44s)]
*  No, no more than Israelis have to sign on to the idea that the Palestinians are indigenous [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3086.16s)]
*  people and not Arab conquerors, which is something you just alluded to. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3093.94s)]
*  I don't need you to believe that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3097.8s)]
*  I don't need... [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3099.48s)]
*  Sorry, did I put words in your mouth again? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3100.48s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3102.48s)]
*  I don't need... [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3103.48s)]
*  Let's say somebody... [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3104.48s)]
*  I know some Israelis believe this. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3105.48s)]
*  I don't need an Israeli to believe that the Palestinians are deeply rooted and are more [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3106.52s)]
*  rooted in the West Bank than Jews are. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3112.2s)]
*  I just need both sides to recognize that this is where we are. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3114.32s)]
*  So can I... [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3119.2s)]
*  Just because we're coming to the time for questions. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3120.2s)]
*  So there are two things I want to ask you about. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3122.8s)]
*  The first is you are a very humane person. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3125.96s)]
*  You recognize obviously the tremendous human cost of what is happening now in Gaza. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3131.2s)]
*  My former colleague, Samantha Power, now says there's a famine in northern Gaza. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3140.4399999999996s)]
*  We've had 30,000 people. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  If you want to say only 17,000 of those people are civilians, I'll sign on to it. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3148.12s)]
*  17,000 people. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3152.7599999999998s)]
*  Too many. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3153.8999999999996s)]
*  Most of those are women and children. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3154.8999999999996s)]
*  We see the criminal...the ICJ case about accusing Israel of genocide. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3157.82s)]
*  We see President Biden is now increasingly becoming tough on Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3167.38s)]
*  with respect to Israel's conduct of the war. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3173.6200000000003s)]
*  We even saw former President Trump say, you can't have this going on. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3175.2200000000003s)]
*  Israel has to be very careful. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3180.54s)]
*  For no other reason that Israel's conduct of the war is causing it to lose massive support [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3184.0400000000004s)]
*  and legitimacy among people who count themselves as friends to Israel. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3190.28s)]
*  Don't you think it's time for a ceasefire? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3195.2400000000002s)]
*  My question is what would be the content of it? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3199.36s)]
*  Because things have to be specific. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3203.6400000000003s)]
*  We all in Israel ask ourselves a very basic question. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  Had we known when all the previous times we were pressured into very quick ceasefires [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3210.58s)]
*  in previous rounds... [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3217.52s)]
*  In six months, not quick. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3219.0s)]
*  No, not this time. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3220.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm saying in the previous rounds. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3221.3199999999997s)]
*  Had we known that in that we were enabling October 7th, would we have agreed then? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3223.6s)]
*  And this is how we think. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3231.2s)]
*  If we agree, what will we be enabling? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3234.16s)]
*  So the question is, be specific. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3237.78s)]
*  What does a ceasefire mean? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3240.76s)]
*  Is Hamas left standing? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3244.2000000000003s)]
*  Do they keep the hostages? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3246.6800000000003s)]
*  Do they disarm? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3249.48s)]
*  I think this is an important moment to understand what's going on in terms of how the fighting happens. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3251.6400000000003s)]
*  This is not some normal urban warfare. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3260.96s)]
*  This is an unprecedented situation, probably in military history, where not a terrorist [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3264.08s)]
*  group, a governing power, governing land, has created a complete enmeshment of the entire [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3269.64s)]
*  population with its war aims, creating underneath a vast network of tunnels with peers that [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3279.24s)]
*  go into schools, mosques, hospitals. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3287.16s)]
*  And in every apartment there are weapons. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3291.66s)]
*  And the way that Hamas operates is that it goes under the tunnels, enters a shaft, goes [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3295.22s)]
*  to an apartment, the weapons are already waiting there, and then it can engage war. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3301.3399999999997s)]
*  So you don't actually ever see combatants. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3307.7s)]
*  You only see civilians because they wear civilian clothes and they don't carry weapons because [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3310.3799999999997s)]
*  the weapons are already all stashed. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3315.2999999999997s)]
*  This was all prepared throughout Gaza. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3316.98s)]
*  So this is so completely enmeshed that the entire fighting takes place in a situation [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3320.62s)]
*  that is unprecedented. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3331.52s)]
*  I have no doubt five years from now in an obscure military journal there will be people [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3333.02s)]
*  writing how Israel fought this war in a combatant to civilian ratio that was impossible for [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3339.58s)]
*  people to imagine that it could be achieved, given how completely enmeshed and whether [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3348.48s)]
*  complete, given how ingenious the fighting strategy was to really make it disperse throughout [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3354.4s)]
*  the civilian population. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3361.12s)]
*  And people will say that was a remarkable achievement. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3363.08s)]
*  But that will be five years from now in an obscure military journal. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3365.88s)]
*  And by now, as you're right, people have unleashed, I would say, the vilest libel. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3369.48s)]
*  So I am not opposed to a ceasefire, but I want to know what that means. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3375.16s)]
*  Because if just saying words is not serious policy. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3381.68s)]
*  So is Hamas left standing? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3386.2599999999998s)]
*  Are the hostages released? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3388.18s)]
*  Is it disarming? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3390.3799999999997s)]
*  And if not, who will guarantee, because we were promised guarantees in the past, that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3393.0s)]
*  didn't materialize? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3399.16s)]
*  So be specific. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3400.16s)]
*  No, no. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3401.16s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3402.16s)]
*  I think obviously the hostages need to be released. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3403.44s)]
*  And one of the most distressing pieces of news recently was that Hamas said it couldn't [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3406.0s)]
*  find 40 hostages that fit the description that Israel is looking for, which suggests [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3410.0s)]
*  that many of the hostages may no longer be with us. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3415.16s)]
*  I guess what I would say is I just want to know, you know, I don't know if 972 magazine [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3418.7200000000003s)]
*  is in your view repeating libel, is an Israeli magazine. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3424.04s)]
*  is that the way that Israel is prosecuting this war is fairly indiscriminate. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3428.84s)]
*  You know, you could imagine a different, you're saying that Hamas was ingenious. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3437.04s)]
*  Israel could have possibly been more ingenious. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3441.76s)]
*  The Netanyahu government could have done what Jared Kushner was proposing, which is to create [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3443.6800000000003s)]
*  safe zones for Palestinian, Gazan civilians, and then conduct the military operation. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3448.7200000000003s)]
*  A lot of that was done and then we're accused of ethnic cleansing. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3457.36s)]
*  So again, we need to know what environment we operate in. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3460.08s)]
*  But I still think maybe some things could be different. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3464.6s)]
*  But fundamentally, when you understand the complete enmeshment of turning all of Gaza, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3467.92s)]
*  every house, apartments, mosques, schools into part of how they waged the war, and then [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3474.88s)]
*  the destruction is part of that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3483.4s)]
*  It's not something just want-on. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3485.36s)]
*  It's because it's related to how this war is waged. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3487.44s)]
*  And again, we need to go back. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3491.44s)]
*  If people say ceasefire, what does it mean? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3493.0s)]
*  How do we know that it doesn't end and we do not enable what happened after all the [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3496.84s)]
*  other times that we agreed to a ceasefire? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3501.6s)]
*  So I'm trying to get to, you know, somewhere where we can agree on something that would [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3504.2000000000003s)]
*  minimize or alleviate the human suffering in Gaza right now. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3509.76s)]
*  Right now, Israel is in control of much of northern Gaza. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3515.64s)]
*  You have written in that, you know, what Israel should do is we should take northern Gaza, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3518.52s)]
*  we should be in control of northern Gaza. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3525.04s)]
*  Egypt can be in control of southern Gaza. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3526.92s)]
*  And if people who live in northern Gaza want to come back and they want to have the food [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3529.16s)]
*  and the aid that we're going to give them, they have to go on camera and say, hey, you [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3534.0s)]
*  know, I give up any right of return. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3538.2s)]
*  I am not a refugee from Israel proper, et cetera. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3540.28s)]
*  And you know, that I felt was surprising coming from the deeply humane person that I know [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3544.08s)]
*  you to be. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3550.52s)]
*  The idea that, is I not really saying that we need to have like a political test for [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3551.52s)]
*  Palestinian refugees from northern Gaza to just go back to their houses? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3556.64s)]
*  Like wouldn't it be better for the state of Israel to say, it's fine that these people [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3560.72s)]
*  are not Zionists, but my humanitarian impulse is so great, my responsibility and my respect [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3564.48s)]
*  for human life is so great that even though I know those people don't believe in my right [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3571.08s)]
*  to exist, we will provide them food, we will provide them shelter, we will show that we [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3575.32s)]
*  are indeed the most moral army. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3579.4s)]
*  Why isn't that the right answer? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3582.16s)]
*  That was part of a question. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3584.96s)]
*  How do we move to a different future? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3586.56s)]
*  Because again, the issue is how do we get out of here? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3589.12s)]
*  How do we ensure that it's not a cycle of ceasefire and Hamas rebuilds? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3592.68s)]
*  This is what we've had for so long, a century long war. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3596.56s)]
*  How do we get out of it? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3600.72s)]
*  And once you understand that the core of the conflict has always been one, the rejection [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3602.56s)]
*  of a Jewish state and any borders, then at least that was a way to start moving forward. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3609.64s)]
*  The idea was to separate between a zone where the war goes on. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3615.24s)]
*  Egypt has been completely delinquent on its responsibilities to supply. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3619.4399999999996s)]
*  Israel has gone above and beyond to supply at a time of war. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3624.68s)]
*  I've looked into the law. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3628.2s)]
*  The idea was to create a sanctuary area where you begin to create a different future. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3629.9s)]
*  I did it based on looking at what the Americans did in Japan after World War II, what the [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3635.42s)]
*  Allies did in Nazi Germany. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3641.1800000000003s)]
*  How do you begin to transform a total ideology so that we can move to a world of peace? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3643.34s)]
*  And that was the idea, to create a zone which we say here we will build, here we will reconstruct. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3651.1s)]
*  As by now, I've been on record for years now saying, as long as the ideology in Gaza remains [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3657.66s)]
*  from the river to the sea, I said it for years, you are guaranteed that every dollar, every [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3664.62s)]
*  bag of cement, after every round there was always money and aid flowing for reconstruction. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3671.02s)]
*  I always said, given that this is the ideology, all of this will go to building more tunnels [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3676.8599999999997s)]
*  because as far as they're concerned, Gaza is not home. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3683.1s)]
*  Gaza is the launchpad from which to liberate Palestine from the river to the sea. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3687.1s)]
*  So I'll just say one last thing. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3691.46s)]
*  A lot of people in foreign policy, they want to feel good, but it doesn't always do good. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3694.22s)]
*  So sometimes I found it's good for parenting, it's good for governance. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3701.06s)]
*  Sometimes you have to do things that don't feel good, but which will actually begin to [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3704.62s)]
*  do good. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3709.66s)]
*  So if we want to get out of this conflict, and that was also my criticism of our government, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3710.86s)]
*  we need to go to the core ideology that sustains it and begin to transform it. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3715.78s)]
*  I think that's a very important point. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3721.1800000000003s)]
*  I think one thing that people will say is, just responding to this point about Gaza not [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3722.5800000000004s)]
*  being home but being a launchpad, because you are absolutely right. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3729.98s)]
*  They invested in building tunnels, they invested in rockets, they could have invested in other [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3734.1600000000003s)]
*  things. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3737.6200000000003s)]
*  The response that you will get, and I'm not sure that you can discredit it entirely, is, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3738.6200000000003s)]
*  well, when Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it withdrew from a Gaza whose airport had [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3743.82s)]
*  been demolished in 2001, it instituted a naval blockade, so it was very hard for things to [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3750.1000000000004s)]
*  come into Gaza. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3756.98s)]
*  When the Israelis withdrew, they didn't help set up the PA to actually be able to withstand [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3760.38s)]
*  the Hamas rebellion that everybody knew was going to come. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3767.26s)]
*  And then on top of that, we have what I'm alluding to, which was Benjamin Netanyahu [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3770.5s)]
*  kind of giving Hamas money under the table. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3775.22s)]
*  So at least at a minimum, I'm saying there's this alternative hypothesis there about why [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3777.78s)]
*  Gaza became this place of threat to your country and your people that doesn't rest on us saying [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3782.48s)]
*  that no, no, no, it's just because they're all unrepentant anti-Semites. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3789.14s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3794.26s)]
*  Again, everything, we know that on the eve of October 7th, the Human Development Index [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3799.66s)]
*  of Gaza, not the West Bank, which is better, Gaza was better than 80 countries in the world. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3805.9s)]
*  Well, wait a minute. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3811.22s)]
*  It's high literacy. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3812.22s)]
*  That's driven by high literacy, right? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3813.22s)]
*  Gaza's per capita GDP in 2022 was $1,000. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3814.74s)]
*  It had a 46% unemployment rate. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3821.66s)]
*  This was not a good place. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3824.42s)]
*  This was one of the most emiserated places in the world. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3826.2s)]
*  The only reason they had a high literacy rate and good health care is because of UNRWA, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3828.8s)]
*  which you want to defund. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3832.88s)]
*  But again, the ideology there has never, ever changed. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3835.0s)]
*  And the Human Development Index was better than 80 countries. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3841.32s)]
*  There was not this notion of misery. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  We now have what the mayor of Gaza wrote. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3847.44s)]
*  People are saying it was a lot of good things. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3851.8s)]
*  The reason that Palestinians have been ideologically committed to no Jewish state has never been [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3854.7599999999998s)]
*  for lack of resources, because of misery. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3861.52s)]
*  All I always say, give them the respect of taking them at their word. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3866.2799999999997s)]
*  They constantly tell you what they're fighting for. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3871.3799999999997s)]
*  Take them at their word that they are indeed committed to that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3875.24s)]
*  They believe it's a noble goal. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3878.52s)]
*  We need to respect how committed they are to it. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3880.3999999999996s)]
*  I'll try to bribe them away for it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3884.04s)]
*  But understand that we will never have peace if this remains the ideology. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3885.88s)]
*  Okay, Dr. Wolf, with your permission, can I take questions? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3890.32s)]
*  So I have a long list of people who are as eager to engage with you as I have been. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3894.08s)]
*  So I will start with Maya and then Bishop. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3898.68s)]
*  Where's Maya? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3902.92s)]
*  Maya is right here. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3904.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3911.56s)]
*  Hi. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3912.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3913.56s)]
*  So I'm Maya. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3914.56s)]
*  I'm an Israeli student here at HKS. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3915.56s)]
*  And my question is, the way I understand what you're saying is, it's not that land grab [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3918.48s)]
*  is an obstacle for peace and it's not that giving land back will help us get peace. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3924.88s)]
*  Until the Palestinians change their ideology in a deep way, there's nothing we can do. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3929.92s)]
*  Now I see a few political actors in Israel that basically agree. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3937.44s)]
*  I see a smotrich or the settler movement that basically says the same and their solution [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3941.7599999999998s)]
*  to that is ethnic cleansing or immigration from choice. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3946.64s)]
*  And you also see the wing, the faction that Netanyahu represented, but as you said, many [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3952.2s)]
*  others too, of listen, there's nothing we can do. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3957.04s)]
*  The best we can do is to manage the conflict. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3960.7999999999997s)]
*  We have to live with rounds of violence. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3962.68s)]
*  Now October 7th. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3965.04s)]
*  What's your proposal? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3966.8399999999997s)]
*  What can Israel do proactively moving forward so we'll have a Palestinian partner? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3968.34s)]
*  And is the war we're conducting now in Gaza is settler violence that is basically not [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3975.1400000000003s)]
*  being policed at all and huge expansion of settlements in the West Bank? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3981.42s)]
*  Is that helping to create the partner we want to have on the other side? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3986.1000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3989.6600000000003s)]
*  So, and you also talked about it, if this were an equation. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3990.6600000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that are kind of you do this, you do that, but they're not [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=3996.66s)]
*  going to the core issues. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4004.58s)]
*  So what would I recommend? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4006.2s)]
*  And I've written a lot about it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4007.98s)]
*  First define the goal. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4010.24s)]
*  And I think we have not done that well in the past. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4012.46s)]
*  Define the goal clearly that the path to peace is Arab and especially Palestinian acceptance [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4016.54s)]
*  of the equal Jewish rights to self-determination in part of the land with the implication that [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4024.04s)]
*  there's no perpetual refugee hood and no right of return into the sovereign territory of [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4030.6s)]
*  Israel. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4035.16s)]
*  So first of all, define it as the goal. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4036.16s)]
*  Sometimes I call myself a long term peace activist. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4038.48s)]
*  I don't know how long things will take, but this is the goal. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4041.1s)]
*  Step two, remove all the fuel that undermines this goal. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4045.06s)]
*  So anything that sustains a Palestinian vision that Israel is temporary, as much as we can [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4052.64s)]
*  remove it, we need to. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4061.8399999999997s)]
*  This is why I've been doing a lot of work indeed on Israel not being the number one [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4063.7799999999997s)]
*  lobbyist for UNRWA because ultimately it helps sustain this notion that Israel is a temporary [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4068.96s)]
*  aberration in the region and that its time is near. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4075.2s)]
*  And third, try to bring partners who will promote this vision of acceptance. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4079.48s)]
*  To the extent that we have those partners in the Arab world, sometimes I call this vision, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4087.56s)]
*  this is how we began our kind of our, I call this vision Arab Zionism or Muslim Zionism. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4093.08s)]
*  It is essentially an Arab and Muslim acceptance that the Jews in the land are not some white [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4099.52s)]
*  European settler colonialists, which are all just fancy synonyms for foreign and therefore [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4107.24s)]
*  always lead to a policy of let's eject the foreigners, but rather Abraham. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4112.4s)]
*  A recognition, a flipping that looks at the Jewish state as the expression of the historical [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4119.4s)]
*  connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel to the extent that especially Arab [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4126.04s)]
*  countries but other Arab and Muslim countries have that vision and can help support the [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4133.08s)]
*  creation of a Palestinian identity and ultimately statehood based on that idea. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4139.22s)]
*  Those are the three things that I think Israel should clearly pursue. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4145.88s)]
*  As I said at the end of the day, the Jews are a minority in an overwhelming Arab and [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4150.68s)]
*  Muslim Middle East. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4156.04s)]
*  The things that we do have to be long term, have to be with that vision. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4158.84s)]
*  And I'll also end with this, there's sometimes this idea that violence necessarily breeds [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4164.84s)]
*  violence or hatred. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4169.76s)]
*  I don't think empirically it's not true. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4172.68s)]
*  We have been subject to a lot of violence and we made peace with Egypt and we repeatedly [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4175.18s)]
*  negotiated with Palestinians even though again we were subject to horrific attacks. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4181.12s)]
*  The notion that human beings only respond to violence with greater extremism is empirically [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4188.9s)]
*  not true. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4195.5s)]
*  And I believe people have choice, people have agency. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4197.24s)]
*  So for me the question is less about the war right now and that also goes to what my proposal [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4201.32s)]
*  was. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4207.08s)]
*  How do we begin to create a vision where it's clear that we want to live side by side but [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4208.08s)]
*  there's a Jewish state in the side by side. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4215.08s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4218.36s)]
*  I'll come here and can I encourage everybody to really keep your question as brief as possible. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4219.84s)]
*  So Bishop. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4224.84s)]
*  That was brief. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4225.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, well going forward. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4226.84s)]
*  Thank you Dr. Wolf. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4228.12s)]
*  I'm Bishop Jones. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4230.36s)]
*  I'm studying government here at HKS as well as Divinity at Divinity School. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4231.36s)]
*  I just had a quick question for you because we as many conservative evangelicals as well [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4237.4800000000005s)]
*  as Protestant Democrats have always supported this notion that we have an obligation, a [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4243.92s)]
*  moral obligation to support Israel because of what you referred to earlier as the Abrahamic [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4250.92s)]
*  covenant. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4255.12s)]
*  But the contradiction that we're having obviously now is that many of the decisions that are [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4256.72s)]
*  being made now are not being based upon biblical mandates of morality. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4260.84s)]
*  I think you even said at least twice that you're not making moral decisions, you're [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4265.6s)]
*  making political decisions and that sort of contributes to our apprehension now. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4269.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean you're really shedding support now in both those camps because of that. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4275.080000000001s)]
*  And in light of the losses that we're seeing in Israel now and Palestine, especially among [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4280.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people, many people are having a hard time reconciling the requirement, the [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4286.320000000001s)]
*  biblical requirement that you forfend against shedding innocent blood. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4291.88s)]
*  I mean Solomon made that very clear as well as this notion of eye for an eye, which is [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4295.76s)]
*  a biblical mandate, has been woefully underappreciated. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4301.16s)]
*  We have 27 times as many Palestinians who've lost their lives and it just doesn't help [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4304.68s)]
*  the cause. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4310.2s)]
*  My question is how do you encourage the evangelicals as well as the Protestants in this country [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4311.2s)]
*  to continue to support a nation that has voided their biblical obligations to their [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4315.48s)]
*  covenant but are using that same covenant to justify their existence there? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4322.959999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4327.759999999999s)]
*  OK, so first of all, in terms of the historical connection, the historical cultural connection, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4329.28s)]
*  it's not just sometimes people who say, oh, you take a book from several thousand years [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4339.0s)]
*  ago and that's your justification. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4344.2s)]
*  The idea of the right of the Jewish people to self-determination, their ancestral homeland, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4345.4400000000005s)]
*  rests not in a single moment in time. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4352.6s)]
*  It rests on thousands of years of maintaining ourselves as a people in connection to a land. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4355.400000000001s)]
*  So it's cultural and historical and ritual. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4363.32s)]
*  It's not just kind of one pronouncement or one book. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4367.04s)]
*  It is the essence. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4370.28s)]
*  We live by the Hebrew calendar. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4372.0s)]
*  That's an agricultural calendar of the land. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4373.8s)]
*  And clearly given the fact that we're small people, we will always need allies and we [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4378.88s)]
*  will always need support. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4384.24s)]
*  And we have, you know, it wasn't always the United States. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4387.36s)]
*  Throughout our history, there were different countries who were our allies. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4392.84s)]
*  And when that changed, other countries were allies. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4396.0s)]
*  We clearly cannot survive on our own. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4398.56s)]
*  Seven million Jews seeking sovereignty in a region still largely hostile to our very [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4402.6s)]
*  existence. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4408.120000000001s)]
*  That is a challenge we face. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4409.68s)]
*  But I will challenge that the notion that this war is being conducted as revenge or [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4412.200000000001s)]
*  without any kind of thinking about human life. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4420.0s)]
*  It's very much one needs to really understand how Hamas has spent years, if not decades, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4424.4s)]
*  creating an entire strip that is what some military experts say the most fortified place [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4433.839999999999s)]
*  in military history, completely enmeshed with the civilian population, very much building [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4440.92s)]
*  a strategy on this enmeshment of the civilian population. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4447.24s)]
*  And you are right. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4451.839999999999s)]
*  It is an ingenious strategy because it leaves very few options and Israeli soldiers are [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4453.48s)]
*  having to fight in a way that is often much more dangerous to them in order to be precise [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4462.24s)]
*  and go from apartment to apartment to clear every single apartment of arms. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4469.32s)]
*  But we need to get to a different future. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4477.0s)]
*  So we are waging this war because we need to make sure that what happened on October [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4479.76s)]
*  7th cannot happen again. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  And unfortunately, we're standing against an enemy that still says that it will do so [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4488.8s)]
*  again and again and again. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4496.360000000001s)]
*  We have repeatedly agreed to ceasefires in the past and then received this. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4498.76s)]
*  So my only question is, what do people propose? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4504.8s)]
*  That's what I said in terms of how else to fight this so that we are guaranteed that [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4510.12s)]
*  there is no more massacres, that level of brutality, the kidnappings that are made in [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4516.04s)]
*  the name of a total ideology that is not willing to let the state exist in any borders, that [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4526.360000000001s)]
*  is not willing to accept sovereign Jews in any borders. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4533.44s)]
*  We are fighting it in a way, we are the people who are the least interested in civilian casualties. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4538.04s)]
*  We would love it if Hamas had created nice, neat areas of fighting. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4546.24s)]
*  They would wear their kind of uniforms and we could find them. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4553.16s)]
*  But there's no clean shot all across of Gaza. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4558.04s)]
*  And you're right, we are now at a point where the world is essentially telling us, stop [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4562.4s)]
*  it and Hamas is standing, they have the hostages, a lot of the infrastructure of the weapons [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4568.4s)]
*  in the tunnels remains there. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4576.24s)]
*  And something dark has been unleashed into the world, which basically tells us, don't [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4580.04s)]
*  defend yourself. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4584.76s)]
*  So I want to take more questions and I know we have to end by 1.30. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4586.92s)]
*  So the next person I have is Jonathan Samosis. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4593.8s)]
*  Oh, it was the same question? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4597.68s)]
*  Okay, very good. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4599.8s)]
*  So let me come to Shelley. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4600.84s)]
*  Do you want me to take both of the questions? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4608.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4610.84s)]
*  My question is, in all negotiations, each side has to make concessions to reach a compromise [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4613.84s)]
*  agreement, so distinguishing against a unilateral agreement. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4619.28s)]
*  So my question is, what are you proposing Israel concedes if Palestinians give up the [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4622.32s)]
*  terminology of refugees or the right of return and disavow Hamas? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4627.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm talking about the bigger issue, not just the current conflict. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4630.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4634.72s)]
*  As I said, basically, that would be the path to a sovereign Palestinian state. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4637.72s)]
*  So I'm not sure what the question is. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4641.84s)]
*  My question is, what concessions will Israel make in exchange for the Palestinians making [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4643.72s)]
*  those concessions? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4648.4800000000005s)]
*  So give me an example, I'm not sure. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4649.4800000000005s)]
*  Dismantle all the settlements? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4651.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that for example? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4652.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's a question. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4653.4800000000005s)]
*  What would Israel do if they did those two things? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4654.76s)]
*  If they did those two things, there would be full Palestinian state in the West Bank [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4658.0s)]
*  and Gaza, capital in East Jerusalem, sovereign. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4661.6s)]
*  That's the end of the conflict. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4663.96s)]
*  That's it. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4665.08s)]
*  I think, by the way, I'm so glad that that question was asked because it's important [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4666.08s)]
*  that people understand your vision for the end of this very much is consistent with [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4671.6s)]
*  Shimon Peres and with Yitzhak Rabin, with this, the end point of the peace camp of which [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4676.68s)]
*  you are no longer a part. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4684.72s)]
*  No, I am a part of this long term. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4686.200000000001s)]
*  But I guess I could imagine some people saying to in Israel, what are you talking about, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4688.96s)]
*  Inat? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4694.56s)]
*  I don't care if the Palestinians give up their right of return or not. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4695.56s)]
*  I would much rather have more settlements in the West Bank and the Palestinians having [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4700.2s)]
*  the delusion of the right of return than the Palestinians giving up their sense of the [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4706.8s)]
*  right of return. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4710.679999999999s)]
*  And then suddenly the entirety of Judea and Samaria doesn't belong to me and East Jerusalem [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4711.679999999999s)]
*  as well. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4715.72s)]
*  Do you ever get that reaction in Israel? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4716.72s)]
*  Actually no. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4719.44s)]
*  What I get the reaction is, and I speak also to very right wing groups and I chart to them [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4720.44s)]
*  a vision where really there is a deep Arab and Palestinian acceptance of the equal Jewish [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4727.52s)]
*  rights to self-determination in the land. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4734.56s)]
*  And I tell them, you know that under these conditions, Israelis are out of the West Bank. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4736.4400000000005s)]
*  And they say, yeah, we know. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4742.88s)]
*  It's just we don't think it's going to happen. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4744.4800000000005s)]
*  So they know where Israelis are. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4746.400000000001s)]
*  And again, not because there's any notion of being good. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4750.42s)]
*  It's because we're small. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4752.9400000000005s)]
*  So if we can really be accepted, if the conflict could really be over, if we can live in a [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4754.42s)]
*  smaller state but just be left to our devices and do our thing and live in peace, there [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4763.26s)]
*  is no question that this is what we would want. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4770.78s)]
*  And again, this has been our revealed preference always. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4773.62s)]
*  Last question will be over here. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4777.58s)]
*  Hi Roy. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4779.18s)]
*  Hi Roy. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4781.18s)]
*  I'm an Israeli in the MPP program at the Harvard Kennedy School. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4782.18s)]
*  Thank you for coming here. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4785.1s)]
*  First of all, I'm disappointed you haven't mentioned West Planing here at all. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4788.5s)]
*  I'll do that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4792.02s)]
*  And second, I wanted to ask you what are the pros and cons for Israel unilaterally agreeing [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4793.76s)]
*  for a Palestine state? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so just West Planing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4804.84s)]
*  What is that? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4808.62s)]
*  West Planing is a word I invented when Western journalists and diplomats explain away what [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4809.7s)]
*  Palestinians clearly say. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4814.98s)]
*  So they will say that they insist on return. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4817.38s)]
*  They will say that Hamas represents them and people will West Plane it away because it's [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4820.66s)]
*  uncomfortable. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4827.0199999999995s)]
*  So as I said, I listened to them and very carefully. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4828.76s)]
*  Unilateral. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4833.5s)]
*  You said recognition or getting out of the West Bank? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4835.72s)]
*  Recognition is independent. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4838.98s)]
*  So for example, for me recognition is again part of this whole package. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4843.62s)]
*  So for example, when Spain or France or in the past Sweden, they want to recognize a [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4849.259999999999s)]
*  Palestinian state. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4854.099999999999s)]
*  I always say, you know what, not a bad idea. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4855.66s)]
*  Do it as a package. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4858.7s)]
*  Make it clear that in the state of Palestine, no one is a refugee from Palestine. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4860.2s)]
*  Make it clear that in parallel with recognizing the state of Palestine, you are not continuing [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4867.08s)]
*  to fund the ideas that people living in the state of Palestine are refugees from Palestine. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4873.16s)]
*  Make it clear that you are really seeking to build statehood rather than just play some [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4880.6s)]
*  games. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4887.28s)]
*  So for me, this is also to the question that was here. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4889.4s)]
*  This is the package. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4892.32s)]
*  So there's nothing unilateral here in the sense that if we want peace, peace has to [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4894.18s)]
*  be based on the mutual recognition of the two sides to the right of self-determination [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4901.02s)]
*  in that land with the understanding that neither side can have all of it and then each side [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4909.02s)]
*  will have some of it. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4915.4800000000005s)]
*  But to get to that recognition, it's the package to recognize a state, but that state will [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4918.34s)]
*  not behave like a state. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4927.54s)]
*  You know, a lot of people recognize the state of Palestine. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4929.16s)]
*  I think more than 100 countries recognize the state of Palestine. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4931.860000000001s)]
*  And yet in that state, you continue to have millions of people who were born there, never [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4935.4400000000005s)]
*  who consider themselves refugees from Palestine. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4945.54s)]
*  You have Prince William, you have the Pope visiting, it says on their itinerary, they're [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4949.66s)]
*  visiting Palestine. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4954.3s)]
*  And the first place they are taken to visit is a neighborhood called the refugee camp. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4956.14s)]
*  And no one bothers to ask, how am I in the state of Palestine? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4962.82s)]
*  And that state continues to support and sustain the ideas that in that state, people living [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4967.94s)]
*  in that state are refugees from somewhere, from Palestine, essentially from the river [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4974.94s)]
*  to the sea. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4980.66s)]
*  So for me, you can't just take one package or one element. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4981.98s)]
*  It has to be a full package at the end of which there is a clear Jewish state that is [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4987.139999999999s)]
*  embraced, that is accepted, and there is an Arab Palestinian state that is embraced [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4992.38s)]
*  and accepted. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4997.9400000000005s)]
*  And both of them understand that they cannot have all of it. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=4998.9400000000005s)]
*  But there is finally a recognition that out of the two states, one is Jewish. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5002.4400000000005s)]
*  So Dr. Wilf, I think we could probably spend another 90 minutes talking to you. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5009.9800000000005s)]
*  And I want to say, so when I was a kid growing up in Saudi Arabia, I used to subscribe to [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5015.64s)]
*  National Geographic. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5019.82s)]
*  I used to love reading National Geographic. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5020.82s)]
*  And there's an article in one of these articles was about Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5023.219999999999s)]
*  sultan. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5029.08s)]
*  We would probably agree that it would all be great if we could go back to the Ottoman [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5030.08s)]
*  Empire. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5033.139999999999s)]
*  But Ben-Gurion thought he was going to be a lawyer in the Ottoman Empire. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5034.139999999999s)]
*  But there is a line in that National Geographic article where they referred to a poet who [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5038.38s)]
*  yearned not for the day of judgment, but for the day of understanding. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5043.219999999999s)]
*  I feel that one day there will be a day of understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5049.200000000001s)]
*  the two people who are decreed by the Almighty or by nature or whatever force you happen [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5056.84s)]
*  to believe or not believe in to be locked in a Catholic marriage in this land. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5063.08s)]
*  And I believe that you will absolutely be one of those agents of understanding. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5068.64s)]
*  You've certainly helped us understand more how you see this conflict, how you see the [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5074.48s)]
*  way out of this conflict. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5080.799999999999s)]
*  And I hope that you will come again and I hope that this will just be the beginning [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5083.12s)]
*  of a conversation with you. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5087.919999999999s)]
*  So thank you, Aina Twilfe. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5089.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdmDEXatXts&t=5090.4s)]
