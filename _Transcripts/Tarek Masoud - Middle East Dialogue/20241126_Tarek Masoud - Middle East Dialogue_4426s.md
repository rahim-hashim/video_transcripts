# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with H.R.H. Prince Turki Al Faisal
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg)
*  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tarek Massoud. I'm a professor here at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=0.0s)]
*  the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the faculty director of our Middle East Initiative. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=9.8s)]
*  And it is my extraordinary pleasure and honor to welcome you tonight, which is the opening [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=15.24s)]
*  event in our continuing series of Middle East dialogues. And this is something we began [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=21.6s)]
*  at Harvard last year to bring to this university genuine, candid, open conversations with people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=28.08s)]
*  who hold wildly varied but widely shared views on the conflict in Israel and Palestine, the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  causes of that conflict and how it might be brought to an end. And some of you I recognized [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=47.04s)]
*  from last year, and you'll remember that we spoke with a variety of people. We spoke with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=53.54s)]
*  former Trump advisor Jared Kushner. We spoke with Matt Duss, who was a former advisor to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=57.84s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders. We spoke with the Palestinian academic Adela al-Araqat. We spoke [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  with the former Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad. We talked to a former Israeli [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=69.48s)]
*  member of Knesset, Dr. Eynat Wilf, and we hosted the conservative New York Times columnist [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=75.04s)]
*  And I would dare say that we learned a great deal from those encounters, or at least I did. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=83.44s)]
*  We had a lot of arguments. We had even a few laughs. And I would say that we emerged more [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=89.52s)]
*  knowledgeable, empathetic, and most importantly, more cognizant of the profound complexity [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  of that conflict. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=104.12s)]
*  Now this year's series continues that effort, but it expands our aperture beyond the war [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=106.88s)]
*  to encompass the vast transformations that are underway in the entire region. We're not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=114.72s)]
*  going to lose sight of the war, and indeed next week we will speak to the Palestinian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  diplomat Hassem Zomlot, and later in the series we'll speak with the Israeli policy, intellectual [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=126.12s)]
*  Mika Goodman, but we're also going to take up issues such as the economic transformations [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=132.16s)]
*  happening in the region, the political reforms happening or not happening in the region, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=138.0s)]
*  and the role of the United States in the Arab and Muslim world. And in fact, on that latter [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=145.12s)]
*  topic we'll speak with, hopefully he won't cancel on us, Ambassador Robert O'Brien, who [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  is President-elect Trump's former national security advisor. But given the broadened [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=156.24s)]
*  focus of this iteration of the series, it is perhaps fitting that our first guest should [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=161.72s)]
*  be one of the broadest minds in our region, if not our planet, and that is His Royal Highness [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=168.4s)]
*  Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=175.24s)]
*  Prince Turki is well known to all of you. He is the founder and chairman of the King [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=185.48s)]
*  Faisal Center for Research in Islamic Studies, which is one of Saudi Arabia's leading intellectual [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=190.88s)]
*  institutions. And as you'll be able to tell from listening to His Royal Highness speak, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=196.92s)]
*  the adjective that is most fitting for him really is, you know, aside from Urbane. I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  think Urbane is the best adjective, but the second best adjective would be scholarly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=211.16s)]
*  I like to say that His Royal Highness is more in the mold of a professor than even I am. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=215.2s)]
*  Or, why did I say even? Than I am. I'm not at all in the mold of a professor. And so [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=221.0s)]
*  it's not surprising that he spends most of his time today running what is essentially [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=226.92s)]
*  an academic institution and lecturing and sharing his wisdom at other academic institutions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=231.64s)]
*  around the world, including Princeton and Georgetown. What might be slightly more surprising [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=237.2s)]
*  to those of you who are not familiar with the personal history of this extraordinarily [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=242.72s)]
*  thoughtful, cultured, and humane gentleman is that he spent 24 years as the head of Saudi [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=248.28s)]
*  Arabia's general intelligence director, which is the Saudi equivalent of the CIA. Now, in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=254.16s)]
*  Arabic it's called Al-Mukhabarat Al-Ammah. Anybody from the Arab world who thinks Mukhabarat [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=260.12s)]
*  Al-Ammah does not think scholarly Urbane, gentlemen, we typically think of harder, harder [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  people. Certainly not people with the extraordinary elegance, erudition, and benevolence of Prince [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Turki. Indeed, the prince chronicles some of his time as the director of intelligence [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  in this new book called The Afghanistan File, which is about his efforts, particularly in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Afghanistan, both to push the Soviets out of Afghanistan and then to come to some kind [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=292.8s)]
*  of workable post-Soviet invasion order. After leaving that post, His Royal Highness, as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=297.88s)]
*  you all know, served as the Saudi ambassador to the United Kingdom and then to the United [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=305.12s)]
*  States. So the gentleman that we have here with us today is not just a witness to history, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=309.44s)]
*  but a shaper of it, and we are extraordinary privileged this evening to have access to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=315.32s)]
*  his first-rate mind as we strive to understand what is happening in the region that he loves, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=319.5s)]
*  the country that he loves, and indeed in the world. So the way we will do this is we will [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=326.66s)]
*  speak for about 45 minutes to an hour, then we will open the floor to questions. I have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=331.54s)]
*  been instructed by my overlords to remind everyone that this event is being recorded [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=337.94s)]
*  and live streamed. I've also been given some text to read about how we will handle possible [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  protests, but looking at the batific faces of this extraordinary crowd, I know there [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=351.36s)]
*  will be no protest, not just because they're wonderful people, but because Your Royal Highness [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=356.36s)]
*  is unprotestable. So please join me in welcoming back to Harvard University His Royal Highness, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=361.36s)]
*  Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud. Thank you. Thank you very much. So Your Royal Highness, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=369.36s)]
*  I'd like us to talk about three broad things before we open it up to our highly intelligent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  audience. So the first issue I'd like us to talk about is the war in Gaza, or what Israel [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  is calling a war on seven fronts. I think I could name all the fronts. Then I'd like [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=392.36s)]
*  us to talk about the US Saudi relationship and particularly how it might evolve under [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=398.56s)]
*  President Trump. And then finally, I'd like us to talk about developments in Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=404.16s)]
*  the momentous changes that have been put in place by the Crown Prince Hamid bin Salman. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=409.64s)]
*  So I hope that set of topics is agreeable to Your Highness. So let us dive in. So we [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=415.64s)]
*  are now 13 months into after Hamas murdered more than 1200 Israelis, more than two thirds [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=421.36s)]
*  of whom were civilians and took more than 200 hostages. And in response, Israel's military [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=428.8s)]
*  campaign to eradicate Hamas has killed 45,000 civilians by some estimates, displaced many [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=436.12s)]
*  multiples of that, and has so far resulted in 3000 Lebanese deaths and much more one [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=443.36s)]
*  expects to come. Do you think Benjamin Netanyahu is committing genocide? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=450.48s)]
*  Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. First of all, thank you very much for this opportunity. And I [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=455.48s)]
*  must preface all my remarks by saying that I am not in the Saudi government, so I do [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=462.6s)]
*  not speak for them. But nonetheless, it's, I've had experience in the past, and I think [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=468.76s)]
*  I can honestly say that talking to audiences like yourselves is not only daunting, but [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  sometimes even nerve-making in the sense that being in this institution and with such a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=484.32s)]
*  high degree of many of you IQs, I feel a bit humbled to be the one who is addressing you [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=491.32s)]
*  instead of listening from you. So Tariq Masood has been more than generous in giving me the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=499.32s)]
*  opportunity to meet many of the intellectually inspiring, I can say, icons of professorship [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=508.24s)]
*  in this institution, and I thank him for that. And I thank some of them who are here already [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=518.64s)]
*  for giving me the time to listen to me and just be present while I am telling you my [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=524.4s)]
*  view of what is happening in our part of the world. And Tariq Masood is right. My view [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  on Gaza is that the killing has to stop. And I will not go into who did this and who did [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=542.84s)]
*  that to each other. But it's a long history and a path that over the years many decades [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=554.84s)]
*  of conflict that have led to literally thousands of people being killed, and as Tariq Masood [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=566.96s)]
*  said, maybe even hundreds of thousands of people being displaced as a result of the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=574.96s)]
*  conflict there. And I think for the world to sit by and allow for that amount of killing [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=582.52s)]
*  to continue and displacement to be taking place is, I would give it a criminal indictment [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  of the way that this awful tragedy is being neglected to continue at the present rate [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=595.92s)]
*  that it is doing. And I have said many times that what we need there is on both sides, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=616.64s)]
*  not just the Israelis but also the Arab side, is say enough is enough. And to turn to hopefully [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=624.64s)]
*  wiser heads and more capable leadership around the world to bring to an end this cycle of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=634.88s)]
*  tit for tat and death for death and destruction for destruction. It serves nobody's purpose [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=644.08s)]
*  other than to cause more heartfelt sorrow and anguish and anger and leads even to more [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  anger and extremism and violence as it continues. So this is how I view the situation in Gaza [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  and I hope that President Trump now he has in his campaign, I've heard him many times [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=672.92s)]
*  say that he wants to bring peace to the world and I hope he will keep in mind that particularly [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=680.92s)]
*  the Gaza situation is not only due for peace but it should have had peace for a long time [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=689.28s)]
*  years ago instead of not having it at the moment and definitely not continuing at the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=703.0s)]
*  present rate if not even a lesser rate of killing and destruction. Your Royal Highness, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  an Israeli might respond or a defender rather of Benjamin Netanyahu's strategy might respond [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=718.68s)]
*  and say, yes the humanitarian cost of this war has been massive, however, the Israeli [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=725.88s)]
*  war, Hamas as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia well knows is the bearer of an extremist ideology, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=732.92s)]
*  it must be eradicated, it's not just good for Israel, it's good for the Palestinians, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=740.04s)]
*  it's good for the entire region and unfortunately the only method of eradicating them will necessarily [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  have a high human cost because it hides among the civilian population. I do not accept that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=750.78s)]
*  in the sense that within the Israeli political leadership there are those who espouse extreme [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=758.78s)]
*  views not just of how to deal with the Palestinians but also the aggrandizement of what in their [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=767.62s)]
*  view is a God-given license not only to acquire more territory in our part of the world but [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=776.22s)]
*  also as Mr. Netanyahu has quoted himself using biblical terminology. The issue of killing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=783.82s)]
*  and destruction is part of that fringe in the Israeli leadership. So would it be a question [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=791.48s)]
*  to ask the Hamas terrorist group and it is considered a terrorist group in Saudi Arabia [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=800.7s)]
*  that they justify their killing of the Israelis by pointing to these extremists in Israel [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=808.7s)]
*  and saying they also deserve death? I don't think so and I don't think that there should [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=816.94s)]
*  be any justification for any civilian killing. I recognize in any war and so on that there [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  is collateral damage. All wars bring that but this particular issue is not a question [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=830.46s)]
*  of the method that the Israeli armed forces have used. Carpet bombing of districts and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=838.5400000000001s)]
*  neighborhoods in various towns of Gaza and if they use modern techniques as we hear written [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=847.26s)]
*  in the papers and hear on television and so on that they are so sophisticated in their [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=860.0600000000001s)]
*  use of technology that they can identify a terrorist within a group of 10 or 15 people [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=867.14s)]
*  walking in the street or in a demonstration and so on. Well I think they could also be [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=875.2199999999999s)]
*  more careful about how they use their military superiority the way that it is with less infliction [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  on civilian casualties. For example they say that in the tunnels as they say under hospitals [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=886.94s)]
*  and under mosques and under so on there are Hamas fighters. Well I don't think you should [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=895.94s)]
*  bomb the mosque and the school to get the Hamas fighters. I think you should go in the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=902.94s)]
*  tunnels and get them in there. That is the view that the Israeli military has in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=907.94s)]
*  West Bank. That is the view that I'm sure others will dispute but that kind of consideration [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=914.94s)]
*  I think should be given by the leadership in Israel to how they deal with whoever is [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=921.94s)]
*  inflicting harm on them not just in Gaza but in the West Bank for example. In the refugee [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=927.1400000000001s)]
*  camps in the West Bank there is no talk about tunnels like there is in Gaza and yet we see [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=937.2600000000001s)]
*  the Israeli armed forces using extraordinary force, tanks and other war making machines [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=944.3s)]
*  to invade whole neighborhoods in the West Bank and destroy them. That causes more civilian [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=954.26s)]
*  casualties so they should be more targeted in their dealing with the so called terrorists [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=962.3s)]
*  that they want to eradicate than to allow for the what is it you said 45,000. That is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=967.82s)]
*  an estimate. That's an estimate from the Ministry of Health in Gaza which is Hamas controlled [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=977.1800000000001s)]
*  so whenever I cite that statistic to Israelis they say that could be even an overestimate. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=982.74s)]
*  Well it could be but my view is even one death on both sides is not worth the destruction [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=987.98s)]
*  that is taking place. There is a verse in the Quran which says the death of an innocent [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=995.98s)]
*  person or the killing of an innocent person is like killing all of mankind and that is [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1002.0600000000001s)]
*  the attitude that I think a state with recognition as Israel has in the world should take into [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1009.62s)]
*  consideration unlike a terrorist group. A terrorist group to them they don't care how [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1017.3000000000001s)]
*  many people they kill. Interestingly that verse that your highness mentioned is also [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1022.4599999999999s)]
*  in the Jewish tradition. How would you respond to someone who says to your highness that the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1029.06s)]
*  kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not in a position to criticize Israel's conduct of the war in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1036.1399999999999s)]
*  Gaza given the human cost of the kingdoms war in Yemen which was similarly indiscriminate, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1040.42s)]
*  mounted from the air and resulted in massive civilian casualties? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1048.42s)]
*  And I would say as I mentioned before that the collateral damage happens in all wars [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  but the kingdom has stopped the fight. It is not continuing on a daily basis to kill [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1060.5s)]
*  Yemenis whatever side it is because it doesn't want to be in that position where it can be [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  accused of indiscriminate bombing etc. etc. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1073.06s)]
*  So your highness has spoken movingly and eloquently including in a widely circulated speech at [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1078.26s)]
*  Rice University shortly after the onset of this war last year about the human toll of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1085.8999999999999s)]
*  the war in Gaza. And given your highness' belief in the unacceptable scale of the human [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1092.9799999999998s)]
*  casualties, why has your country been so passive in its response to Netanyahu's conduct [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1099.98s)]
*  of the war? In 1973 your late father King Faisal, the third king of Saudi Arabia was [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1106.98s)]
*  so moved by anger at the United States' support of Israel in its wars with the Arab states [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1114.34s)]
*  that he coordinated an oil embargo against the United States due to its support of Israel. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1121.34s)]
*  And at that time nobody was accusing Israel of doing anything even in the neighborhood [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1126.34s)]
*  of genocide. Israel was just in a war with its neighbors. So not only is your country [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1131.34s)]
*  not doing an oil embargo now but you have informal relations with Israel and if press [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1136.34s)]
*  reports are to be believed Saudi Arabia is slowly pursuing a new strategy of oil embargo [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1141.34s)]
*  and if press reports are to be believed Saudi Arabia is slowly pursuing normalization with [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1148.34s)]
*  the state of Israel. So can you help us understand this? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1152.34s)]
*  Well, your question leads to several answers. One of them is that the kingdom is not pursuing [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1155.34s)]
*  at the moment any normalization talks with Israel because of the war in Gaza. And the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1163.34s)]
*  orchestration of the so-called normalization talks between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1171.34s)]
*  and Israel was at the hands of the American administration. When we were talking to the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1177.34s)]
*  American administration of establishing a firmer linkage, if you like, between the two [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1184.34s)]
*  countries so that we would be sure that when we face issues of a foreign invasion or something [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1189.34s)]
*  like that, that America would be with us and vice versa. The kingdom will be with America [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1196.34s)]
*  when it needs Saudi support, whether military or civilian or in whatever form, et cetera. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1202.34s)]
*  It's a reciprocal relationship. The throwing in of the normalization between Saudi Arabia [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1211.34s)]
*  and Israel occurred at the request of the United States. And the kingdom's response [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1219.34s)]
*  to that was that we must have a Palestinian state in place before we can talk about normalization [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1223.34s)]
*  with Israel. Why? Because we've seen that those countries that did normalize with Israel, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1233.34s)]
*  starting with Egypt in 1978, 79, and going through Jordan and then President Trump's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1240.34s)]
*  so-called Abrahamic talks and events when he was in the presidency, hasn't led to a [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1249.34s)]
*  stopping of the killing. And the Palestinian people continue to suffer in spite of the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1261.34s)]
*  normalization between Israel and all these Arab countries. And the kingdom would like [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1269.34s)]
*  to see an end to that cycle, as I said, of violence, et cetera. And that is why it offered [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1275.34s)]
*  the Arab Peace Initiative back in 2002. And before that, the Fahd Peace Plan, which unfortunately, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1284.34s)]
*  neither of which were accepted by Israel. And the Arab Peace Plan talks about normalization [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1292.34s)]
*  with Israel as a consequence of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on peace and state for Israel. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1300.34s)]
*  So that's one part of an answer to your question. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1314.34s)]
*  Can I just ask a clarification? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1317.34s)]
*  Let me just continue so I don't lose my train of thought. The other one, of course, on the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1318.34s)]
*  embargo. In 1973, the United States imported, I think, over one and a half million barrels [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1325.34s)]
*  of oil from Saudi Arabia. And the share of OPEC oil production at the time was over 50% [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1334.1s)]
*  of world oil production. The Arab portion of OPEC was more than 70% of the OPEC production [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1344.34s)]
*  at the time, if I'm not mistaken. Nowadays, the United States is the leading producer [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1351.34s)]
*  of oil. So any embargo on the United States will have no impact as it did in 1973. There [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1358.34s)]
*  will be those, of course, who say that, well, if there is a stopping of production of oil [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1367.34s)]
*  by Saudi Arabia and other countries in the area, like happened in 1973, that inflation [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1375.34s)]
*  will become so high that the economies of all over the world will be affected and so [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1382.34s)]
*  on. But so will the economies of the oil producers. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1387.34s)]
*  That was true in 73, but you deemed the cause important enough. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1391.34s)]
*  Not really. In 1973, actually, some oil producers made more for their oil producers than they [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1395.34s)]
*  made for their oil because of the scarcity of the oil and selling to other customers. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1404.34s)]
*  So that is something that must be also taken into consideration. There are oil experts [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1411.34s)]
*  here, Your Excellency. Our economic professor here can give you a better answer than me [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1419.34s)]
*  on that issue. But my view is that an embargo these days will not be as effective as the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1426.34s)]
*  oil was in 1973. That was the second portion of your question. The third portion about [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1435.34s)]
*  Saudi Arabia doing something. Saudi Arabia is leading not just the Arab world, but the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1441.58s)]
*  Muslim world and the Europeans in trying to establish the two-state solution for the Arab [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1448.1s)]
*  Israeli dispute. If you look at the diplomatic activity of the kingdom, it expands all around [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  the globe. And the delegations representing several countries, most recently at the United [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1464.34s)]
*  Nations General Assembly, the coalition that was formed headed by Saudi Arabia and Norway [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1473.6999999999998s)]
*  to bring to fruition a two-state solution is an example of what Saudi Arabia is doing [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1481.3799999999999s)]
*  in order to achieve that objective. And it is not sitting on its backside and watching [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1488.9s)]
*  the killing and doing nothing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1496.1000000000001s)]
*  So Your Highness, I'm going to stipulate that everything you say is right and everything [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1498.3000000000002s)]
*  that I say is what comes from ignorance. So I will accept Your Highness's claim that in [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1504.7s)]
*  fact no TARC, Saudi Arabia is doing quite a lot to end the war in Gaza. I think that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1511.2600000000002s)]
*  I would just disagree that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has stipulated that a Palestinian [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1518.94s)]
*  state must be established. My understanding is the precise language is irrevocable steps [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1523.5800000000002s)]
*  towards a Palestinian state are necessary. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1528.94s)]
*  Read what Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in his speech to the Shura Council just a [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1532.1000000000001s)]
*  month ago. Which he said, an establishment of a Palestinian state with its capital in [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1538.0200000000002s)]
*  Jerusalem is the way to get normalization with Israel. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1544.26s)]
*  So let's set aside normalization for a second. So there's an alternative hypothesis about [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1549.26s)]
*  relative Saudi inaction. You have said no TARC, there is no Saudi inaction. So I will [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1556.5s)]
*  flip the question a little bit. So I will accept that Saudi Arabia is doing a lot to [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1561.46s)]
*  try to end this war and has been doing a lot to try to end this war since October 8, 2023. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1566.58s)]
*  What would be Your Highness's... [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1572.9s)]
*  No, I would say that Saudi Arabia has been doing a lot since 1948. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1574.38s)]
*  Fantastic. Even better. Even better. So Your Highness, I guess the question somebody might [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1579.38s)]
*  ask is, wait a minute, why should Saudi Arabia want to pressure the Israelis to end this [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1587.22s)]
*  war? Let's look at the state of play now, a year after October 7th. Yohannes Nwar is [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1594.22s)]
*  dead. Hamas, which Your Highness has said is a terrorist group, is essentially decimated. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1601.22s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, is dead. Several of Hezbollah's top leadership [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1608.22s)]
*  have been killed in a stunning Israeli operation. Israel has even taken the war to your country [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1615.26s)]
*  great rival, Iran, which is now feeling the squeeze and has its proxy network under a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1622.26s)]
*  great deal of pressure. So how would you respond to somebody who says there is no greater servant [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1628.66s)]
*  of the Saudi national interest than Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1633.66s)]
*  And how many other Palestinians and Lebanese have been killed since then? Not just Yohannes [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1637.1s)]
*  Nwar and Nasrallah, but as you said, 45,000 by estimates in Palestine. And the question [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1644.1s)]
*  more than 3,000 in Lebanon. Is it worth for Saudi Arabia to enter into any normalization [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1652.74s)]
*  with Israel while it is continuing to commit this carnage and this destruction of human [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1662.22s)]
*  life, innocent human life? Look at how many children were killed. And look at the consequences [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1671.1s)]
*  of the killing of those children and the orphan making of those who have lost their [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1677.38s)]
*  mothers and their fathers and so on. Their goal, I would dare say, not all of them, but [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1682.14s)]
*  at least some of them will be the next Sinoirs and the next Nasrallah. So you're not ending [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1689.14s)]
*  the cycle of violence by killing Sinoir and there are others that will take their place. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1698.0200000000002s)]
*  And who are going to be their targets? They feel so aggrieved, and I would imagine that [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1707.46s)]
*  anybody losing their parents in the way that they have been killed in Palestine and Lebanon [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1715.5s)]
*  recently through bombing or through explosives or through sniper fire or whatever, will bear [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1720.94s)]
*  in their heart a willingness, not just a willingness, but a well of anger and revenge seeking. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1727.94s)]
*  That you and I cannot estimate because our parents were not in that way. So those are [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1737.38s)]
*  the ones who are going to be the next Sinoirs and the next Nasrallahs and the other mischievous [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1745.0200000000002s)]
*  and miscreants who are going to attack not just American citizens somewhere but Saudi [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1750.38s)]
*  citizens and other victims in the world. When you say to the Israelis, end the war, do you [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1755.94s)]
*  mean just end the war in Gaza or end the war on all of its fronts? Everybody. I don't want [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1762.0200000000002s)]
*  to see killing in any part of our world. When you saw the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1767.18s)]
*  a part of you as the former head of the Saudi Directorate of General Intelligence did not [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1772.38s)]
*  think that was a good thing for your country? Well, as I said, the disappearance of Hassan [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1776.66s)]
*  Nasrallah is not going to end the violence nor the mischief that Hassan Nasrallah caused [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1783.8200000000002s)]
*  not only to Saudi Arabia but to others in the world. They won't be deterred? What? Hezbollah [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1791.82s)]
*  won't be deterred now knowing? Well, I'm sure it will be deterred. Which is good. Yes, but [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  then what happens five years from now? What happens ten years from now? All these Lebanese [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1802.22s)]
*  orphans and victims have been driven out of their homes and livelihoods and so on. They [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1808.7s)]
*  will turn to be similar to Hassan Nasrallah. So, Your Highness, let's talk about ending [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1816.7s)]
*  the war in Gaza. We have a sign here, by the way. That's fine. Eliminate those signs. Never [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1825.46s)]
*  show me a sign like that again. Okay. So, the Israelis will tell you that to end the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  war in Gaza Netanyahu would love to do that, but they are concerned about post-conflicts [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  governance in Gaza. And what the Israelis would ideally love, or at least sensible Israelis [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1856.38s)]
*  would ideally love, is not to reoccupy Gaza but to hand this, the administration of this [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1862.5800000000002s)]
*  territory over to a quote unquote Arab force that would be led by the Kingdom, Egypt, the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1870.06s)]
*  United Arab Emirates, and they would impose order, help the rebuilding of Gaza. They would [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1876.1799999999998s)]
*  own this territory. The Saudis have been very reluctant to do that, and that's part of why, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1882.82s)]
*  some Israelis will say, this part of the conflict, the part of the conflict in Gaza has been [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1889.6599999999999s)]
*  so difficult to end. So, why won't Saudi Arabia commit to coming in and helping reestablish [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1894.38s)]
*  order in Gaza if that is going to end the bloodshed against which Your Highness has [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1901.6200000000001s)]
*  spoken so eloquently? I wish you were right about Netanyahu's concern for the day after, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1905.38s)]
*  which I believe is not. He's more concerned of not going to jail once there is peace between [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1911.7800000000002s)]
*  the Israelis and the Palestinians. So his wishes and his ideas are not as morally high [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1918.5s)]
*  as are portrayed by some people. He's concerned about what's going to happen to the people [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1930.22s)]
*  in Gaza and so on. I'm not saying that. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1935.38s)]
*  Not you, but they are saying that. And so I give no credence or credibility to Netanyahu's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1938.54s)]
*  policy, to anything that comes out of Netanyahu. He is, in my view, a criminal who deserves [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1948.18s)]
*  to be put in court and convicted, not just of genocide, but of other things. He failed [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1955.7s)]
*  his own people. He was the main financier of the so-called terrorist Hamas groups by [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1962.0600000000002s)]
*  allowing Qatar to send money to Hamas through whom? Through Israeli banks. Now he should [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1969.06s)]
*  be brought to trial by the Israeli people because it was his enablement of Hamas that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1976.34s)]
*  allowed Hamas to do what it did. That's one aspect. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1983.4199999999998s)]
*  The other aspect, of course, whether Saudi Arabia and others, I think the whole issue [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1987.4199999999998s)]
*  should be dealt with on a worldwide scale. I think the whole issue should be dealt with [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1992.1799999999998s)]
*  on a worldwide basis and not just an issue of one country or another country. I think [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=1997.98s)]
*  there should be a world commitment through the United Nations. It is the only international [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2004.38s)]
*  organization that is available in spite of its lackings, in spite of its weaknesses, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2011.74s)]
*  et cetera, through which a consortium of world powers will come the day after not only the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2018.74s)]
*  to maintain peace, but also to reconstruct not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2027.42s)]
*  I have recently been also promoting the idea that part of that UN setup would be an article [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2035.8600000000001s)]
*  to come out in the United Nations Security Council resolution barring anybody on the [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2045.46s)]
*  side of the Palestinians and the Israelis who does not accept a two-state solution from [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2051.5s)]
*  being in the negotiations for a two-state solution. That way anybody... [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2057.62s)]
*  That excludes most Palestinians and most Israelis. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2062.98s)]
*  Well, so be it. But a mechanism should be put in place in order to get only those who [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2065.62s)]
*  are committed to the principle of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis to be party [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2073.62s)]
*  to the negotiations. The other part I would recommend also is the establishment of an [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2083.18s)]
*  international fund to be contributed to by the world community in general, including [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2091.02s)]
*  Israel, for the reconstruction of what happened in Gaza and the West Bank and even some of [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2099.02s)]
*  the kibbutzum that were destroyed by Hamas in the first onslaught that Hamas committed [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2108.74s)]
*  on those kibbutz. So this is what I would recommend and I hope that whoever is listening [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2114.74s)]
*  and will take that into consideration. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2120.82s)]
*  Is Your Highness optimistic that the Trump administration will succeed where the Biden [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2123.94s)]
*  administration hadn't? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2127.66s)]
*  I hope so. I've heard Mr. Trump describing Mr. Netanyahu as a man who does not want peace [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2129.3s)]
*  in the Middle East, whereas he described Mahmoud Abbas, for example, as a man who wanted peace [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2138.54s)]
*  between Israel and the Palestinians. So that's one aspect. The other aspect is that Mr. Trump [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2144.66s)]
*  has publicly said that he was stabbed in the back by Mr. Netanyahu when they had agreed [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2150.66s)]
*  together on an operation to get rid of General Soleimani, and at the last minute Mr. Netanyahu [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2157.8199999999997s)]
*  backed down. So I think there is something there between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2163.8199999999997s)]
*  that gives me hope that Mr. Trump will not accept anything that Mr. Netanyahu tells him [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2171.58s)]
*  except to get a peace settlement with the Palestinians. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2181.62s)]
*  So Your Highness, we could talk a lot more about this important conflict, but I do want [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2187.38s)]
*  to just before I turn it over to our audience, we end at 6.30 so we have time, I wanted to [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2191.46s)]
*  ask Your Highness to redirect our conversation now to talking about the American-Saudi relationship. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2197.74s)]
*  So it isn't a secret that the relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Middle [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2203.46s)]
*  East and the United States under the Biden administration at least started off on the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2211.1s)]
*  wrong foot. President Biden came into office saying that he was going to turn Saudi Arabia [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2216.06s)]
*  into a pariah. I've been reading Bob Woodward's new book and he tells a story where Anthony [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2221.62s)]
*  Blinken refers to the crown prince of your country, Mohammed bin Salman, as nothing more [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2228.9s)]
*  than a spoiled child. In contrast, President Trump has made no secret of his warm feelings [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2234.98s)]
*  towards the kingdom and towards its leadership. Your Highness has just mentioned the possibility [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2241.18s)]
*  of a security guarantee from the United States along with American support for Saudi nuclear [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2247.18s)]
*  program. These are things that Saudi Arabia has been seeking. Do you think now under President [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2252.46s)]
*  Trump your country is more likely to get those things? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2257.7400000000002s)]
*  First of all let me start by saying I don't believe everything that Mr. Woodward writes. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2261.5s)]
*  I compare him as a matter of fact and my Arab interlocutors will understand it to Mohammed [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2269.02s)]
*  Hassanein Hekal in Egypt who had an act to invent stories with acceptance by others that [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2276.02s)]
*  they are historical facts. I don't accept everything that Mr. Woodward writes as being [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2283.02s)]
*  true. That's one aspect. But you're right. With Mr. Obama, let me remind us. The first [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2294.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump administration, do you remember in the campaign before that Mr. Trump came to power? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2305.62s)]
*  He was talking about Saudi Arabia in very negative terms. Yet when he came to the presidency [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2314.02s)]
*  and having been briefed and became more aware of what Saudi Arabia and American relationship [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2322.52s)]
*  with it meant and so on, changed his view and Saudi Arabia was the first destination [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2330.82s)]
*  of his trip as president. Same with Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden came as you said intending to make [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2337.46s)]
*  Saudi Arabia a pariah in the world and yet as he is leaving office today he is talking [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2346.94s)]
*  with us on a security agreement and other cooperation in the field and you heard, was [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2353.42s)]
*  it Chatham House rules the first day we had with Hoxin? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2360.42s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2367.42s)]
*  Okay. Well now that I let the bag out, the cat out of the bag, we heard recently from [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2369.1800000000003s)]
*  an American official that the Saudi-American relationship is the best that it's ever been. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2376.94s)]
*  So this has been the case. You know one of the things that is startling in this election [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2383.94s)]
*  is that the name of Saudi Arabia never came up in the campaign. But if you look at previous [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2391.62s)]
*  campaigns, all the way back to Nixon times and post-Watergate, there was always somebody [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2399.7400000000002s)]
*  denigrating Saudi Arabia or accusing it of one thing or another. This time around I was [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2406.74s)]
*  sat there watching it and I must tell you by this audience as I told you and others, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2415.2999999999997s)]
*  I enjoy watching American elections. Not simply because of what they are and they are really [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2420.2999999999997s)]
*  a tremendous exercise in verbal gymnastics, but also because of the way they are. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2429.54s)]
*  And also because of the way they are doing gymnastics and other just amazing talents. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2436.9799999999996s)]
*  It's like watching a Bollywood movie. You have the whole gamut of emotion and action [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2445.5s)]
*  and music and stabbing in the back and bowing down and you know everything is in there. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2453.58s)]
*  And this goes on for four years. I'll bet you from now, well Mr. Trump can't run again, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2460.66s)]
*  but I'm sure his Vice President is already looking to four years from now of presenting [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2468.5s)]
*  himself, and he's already preparing the you know so it's wonderful to be in America and [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2475.54s)]
*  to see this exercise in how people reach decisions and so on. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2482.02s)]
*  And I will add another thing that I said in some of my meetings here. I'm gratified that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2486.54s)]
*  the American political system has proven itself to be so resilient and so strong that this [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2492.7s)]
*  election has passed without any undue friction or doubt or any inclination of an acceptability [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2501.82s)]
*  to one side or the other. And this was not the case in the last election. So that is [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2508.82s)]
*  something I think that is a sign of how strong the institutions are that you enjoy here. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2516.5800000000004s)]
*  Your Highness, first of all thank you for that very rousing endorsement of American institutions. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2524.26s)]
*  I know a lot of people, no I see that in the press as a sign of the American people's [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2529.86s)]
*  endorsement of American institutions. I know a lot of people, no I see that very seriously [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2535.18s)]
*  because I know a lot of people particularly on this campus may be feeling disheartened [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2539.4199999999996s)]
*  about the result because their favorite candidate didn't win, but I think the Prince is redirecting [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2543.98s)]
*  our attention to a deeper source of comfort at what happened and that is the durability [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2548.74s)]
*  of the institutions and the peaceful transfer of power. But Your Highness did not really [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2557.0s)]
*  answer my question about whether the Trump administration coming in increases the likelihood [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2561.78s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia will get things like the ironclad security guarantee and the nuclear [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2567.1600000000003s)]
*  program. I take it from your comment that you're optimistic and so I'd like to ask [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2571.78s)]
*  a follow on question which is okay Saudi Arabia inshallah will get these great things from [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2576.6000000000004s)]
*  the United States of America. What does the United States of America get in return for [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  giving your country a security guarantee and nuclear program etc.? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2588.6000000000004s)]
*  In terms of diplomacy and politics like Mr. Trump got on his first visit to Saudi Arabia. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2591.58s)]
*  Saudi Arabia collected 57 leaders of 57 Islamic countries to hear Mr. Trump give his speech [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2598.86s)]
*  in Riyadh. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2607.56s)]
*  So they can just fill a room for him? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2609.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2611.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what he gets? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2613.06s)]
*  No that's just as I told you in terms of diplomacy and political action for a country like the [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2614.34s)]
*  United States that wants to have and it has the leadership role in the world. So that's [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2620.94s)]
*  one aspect. The other aspect of course, Saudi Arabia through its vision 2030 and its transition [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2627.26s)]
*  from the fossil fuels to a more combination of energy sources from different energy capabilities [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2634.54s)]
*  will be able to work with the United States on economic help for the whole world. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2641.54s)]
*  The Saudi aid program according to UN statistics which the UN by the way in its statistics [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2655.9s)]
*  it requires or asks countries to contribute to aid to other countries and the UN by the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2664.06s)]
*  percentage of 0.04% I think if I'm not mistaken from their GDP to help in aid programs. The [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2672.1s)]
*  kingdom contributes over the past 50 years I would say since we began to get the oil [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2683.7s)]
*  wealth that we have 4.0%. So it is the highest contributor percentage wise of GDP to aid [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2691.38s)]
*  programs not only through United Nations aid agencies but through its own arms of aid that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2698.38s)]
*  it gives through the Islamic development bank, through the Saudi industrial fund, etc. So [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2705.58s)]
*  in terms of economic terms the United States and Saudi Arabia working together can improve [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2710.58s)]
*  the lot of a lot of poor people around the world. That's the other thing. The other aspect [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2716.58s)]
*  that we can have with you is in security matters against the United States and Saudi Arabia [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2721.58s)]
*  in security matters against terrorism. That's been an ongoing Saudi American cooperation [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2726.58s)]
*  forever. When I was in the intelligence business for example I remember in 1997 or 96 if I'm [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2734.5s)]
*  not mistaken there was a joint committee John Deutch is here and I think he can vouch for [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2744.06s)]
*  what we and the American CIA were doing together against terrorist activity and other common [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2750.18s)]
*  interests in there. So there is that factor to be in it as well. And the general well-being [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2759.02s)]
*  of world activity. But do we not get those things if we don't give Saudi Arabia a security [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2767.8599999999997s)]
*  guarantee? Well no I would say that we will not get Saudi American security guarantees [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2773.74s)]
*  if we didn't provide these things. So how reliable do you think President Trump is going [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2782.74s)]
*  to be? Whenever I'm in Saudi Arabia and I ask people about the US Saudi relationship [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2789.08s)]
*  I hear a lot of concern that the United States is not reliable, has not been a reliable ally. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2794.66s)]
*  And people often bring up the September drone strike against Aramco facility in September [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2801.66s)]
*  of 2019. That happened under Trump. Yes. I'm not saying that he will be more reliable now [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2808.8599999999997s)]
*  but that's why the kingdom is entering into this discussion with the United States in [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2815.54s)]
*  order for us to be mutually reliable and not simply the US reliable to Saudi Arabia. But [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2819.8599999999997s)]
*  also I want us in Saudi Arabia to be equally committed to come to the aid of the United [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2825.98s)]
*  States should it need so. As it did without agreement in the past. So your royal highness [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2831.06s)]
*  to close out this portion of our conversation about the US Saudi relationship. I think it's [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2837.7s)]
*  impossible to talk about Saudi Arabia's relationship with the United States without talking about [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2842.2999999999997s)]
*  the murder of your former colleague Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Which has been a real stresser [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2848.2999999999997s)]
*  on the relationship between this country and your highness' country. This is a murder that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2856.3s)]
*  was allegedly at the behest of your country's leadership and in fact our own central intelligence [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2864.7400000000002s)]
*  agency has said that. So what are Americans misunderstanding about that episode? One thing [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2870.1800000000003s)]
*  I think that Americans have not misunderstood and if I may say the CIA as well is that their [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2877.54s)]
*  conclusion was reached through presumption and suspicion and deciphering what they consider [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2883.34s)]
*  to be inclinations on the part of the leadership to be in control of every action that takes [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2898.98s)]
*  place in Saudi Arabia. And I would contend that there is absolutely no proof of that [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2905.7000000000003s)]
*  other than the contention or the suspicion or the supposition that Prince Mohammed bin [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2913.98s)]
*  Salman ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The other thing I think that Americans perhaps [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2920.98s)]
*  don't know about is that the perpetrators of that crime have all been tried and are [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2927.2200000000003s)]
*  in jail. Every one of them who have participated in that crime are in jail at the moment. And [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2933.1400000000003s)]
*  the other thing of course that you may not know is that Jamal Khashoggi worked with me [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2941.1s)]
*  as my press spokesman in the embassy in London and then subsequently in Washington. So I [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2948.46s)]
*  personally feel personal grievance at his killing and at his murder the way that he [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2956.98s)]
*  was murdered by whom? By fellow Saudis. That is to me as heinous a crime as can happen [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2963.98s)]
*  anywhere. But I would also add to that that rogue elements in governments are not unique [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2976.58s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia. And there have been other incidents around the world including in this [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2983.58s)]
*  country where rogue elements took things under their own decision and did things that would [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=2991.58s)]
*  reflect badly on the leadership. I don't think anybody can blame President Bush for [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3001.8199999999997s)]
*  example, George W. Bush for what happened in Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And I have seen no [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3008.42s)]
*  blame being put on President Bush or his then Secretary of Defense. I've seen a lot of [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3014.7s)]
*  blame. Well, but what has it done? There was no CIA estimate that said Mr. Bush gave the [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3020.9s)]
*  order. Right, right. Of course. Nobody thinks that. Yes. Understood. So these are things [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3027.74s)]
*  I think that whoever knows Saudi Arabia also, it is out of the psyche of any Saudi government [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3031.98s)]
*  institution to undertake such a crime. Your Royal Highness, I am probably not going to [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3038.98s)]
*  be able to get out of this room alive unless we turn it over for questions. So I'll just [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3051.18s)]
*  ask two short questions on the internal reforms and then we'll open it up to our audience. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3055.1s)]
*  And we have the room until 6.30. You last short questions in order to get me to give [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3060.82s)]
*  him a very long answer. So Your Highness, the reforms in Saudi Arabia are nothing short [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3064.42s)]
*  of momentous. I grew up in Saudi Arabia. The country is almost unrecognizable from when [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3072.34s)]
*  I grew up there and unrecognizable in ways that are almost entirely good. But do you [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3078.5s)]
*  ever worry that the pace of change is too rapid, that Saudi Arabia is losing its distinctiveness, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3084.02s)]
*  that Saudi culture and Saudi groundedness and its particular practice of Islam is being [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3092.02s)]
*  traded for participation in a kind of unmoored global culture that is the same in Singapore, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3099.38s)]
*  Dubai, or downtown Boston? My view is that hopefully the moral composition of Saudi culture [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3106.38s)]
*  itself by the country opening up to the rest of the world as it has done will be also impactful [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3113.38s)]
*  on our visitors as it is on our citizens. When they see how Saudis live, how they receive [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3124.06s)]
*  others, the friendliness. I have a few of my friends here who have been to Saudi Arabia [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3134.62s)]
*  and I wish they would come up and speak for it. I am prejudiced when I speak in this. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3140.62s)]
*  One of my colleagues, two of them actually are here with us. I don't know if there are [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3149.8599999999997s)]
*  others as well, have been to the kingdom and they can tell you better than I can what Saudi [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3156.8599999999997s)]
*  Arabia is and the distinct generosity and friendship that Saudi Arabia has. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3162.8599999999997s)]
*  And the friendship and empathy that Saudis have for others who come to enjoy other sites [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3171.62s)]
*  or to do business or whatever you like. But this is an opportunity for me to tell you [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3179.1s)]
*  all that you are welcome to come to Saudi Arabia. Now, Alhamdulillah, after many years [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3184.58s)]
*  of restrictions on visitors from abroad, you can go online and get a visa in five minutes. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3191.58s)]
*  So please take advantage of that and come and see for yourself. Don't believe what I [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3199.58s)]
*  tell you. And what I have seen from those who have come and left the kingdom, you told [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3205.04s)]
*  me that the students you took to Saudi Arabia last year. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3211.2999999999997s)]
*  They want to work there. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3214.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they all want to work there. Why? Because they saw something that was attractive to [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3216.42s)]
*  them. So I don't think reform is going to dilute our substance, if you like, or our [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3220.74s)]
*  essence as a people or as a culture. But I hope that it will also reciprocally allow [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3227.14s)]
*  others to be affected, but what we would consider to be a better way to conduct their lives [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3235.66s)]
*  in their daily lives. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3244.5s)]
*  The economic reforms, the social reforms that have been happening in Saudi Arabia are absolutely [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3248.1s)]
*  momentous. I've heard the Crown Prince and others in the Saudi leadership talking about [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3253.46s)]
*  how these reforms are aimed at remaking the Saudi citizen and turning them into a more [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3259.7s)]
*  empowered person who thinks critically. When you have people who are empowered and thinking [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3266.02s)]
*  critically, how far, how long will it be until the economic and social reforms are also coupled [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3273.02s)]
*  with political reforms to create a political system that can absorb these empowered and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3281.02s)]
*  critical thinking people? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3288.02s)]
*  Well, we are an evolving country like all countries are. And I think the citizens are [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3290.02s)]
*  the ones who are responsible for how they will approach that. And it's not going to [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3296.02s)]
*  be a matter of a top-down decree on what to do with that, but rather a matter of how we [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3301.02s)]
*  can have an integration of the sense of what the people want and what the leadership can [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3310.74s)]
*  provide them. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3319.38s)]
*  And there is a very classical Arabic saying attributed to the Khalifa Muawiyah Ibn Abi [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3321.02s)]
*  Sufyan, who followed the four principal caliphs of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3328.02s)]
*  when he was asked about how he dealt with the people. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3338.02s)]
*  Is this Shahr-e-Khmaawiyah? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3341.02s)]
*  Shahr-e-Khmaawiyah, which is the hair of Muawiyah. He said, there is a hair that is held on both [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3343.02s)]
*  sides by me and by the people. If the people pull, I get the hair. And I said, I'm going [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3350.02s)]
*  to give in. If they let loose, I pull. And it is that kind ofâ€” [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3358.02s)]
*  Never let it break. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3364.02s)]
*  I never let it break, yes. That was the end of it. And in the kingdom, the relationship [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3365.02s)]
*  and the institution, if you like, of the public medullusâ€”the medullus is the audience that [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3373.02s)]
*  the king and the crown prince give to the public on a weekly basis, where any citizen [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3379.58s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia can come and address whatever grievance, whatever opinion, or something [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3386.3s)]
*  like that that he wants from the king and so on. And that is a practice that is very [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3392.7000000000003s)]
*  much part and parcel of the makeup of the DNA system of the Saudi leadership. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3399.98s)]
*  Whether there's going to be more political reform, I cannot say. But my hope is that [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3409.26s)]
*  this hair that is linked between the leadership and the people will never break. And therefore, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3416.6200000000003s)]
*  the reform will come when the people want it to come. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3425.26s)]
*  I've always felt the leadership of this university needs to read about Shahrukh Muawiyah. So [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3428.7400000000002s)]
*  we are now going to open it up for questions. We have two microphones at either end of the [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3433.3s)]
*  room. So if you would please queue up at the microphone. This microphone is very lonely, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3439.34s)]
*  so I would love to see some people queuing up at it. And I would love for there to be [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3446.7400000000002s)]
*  some gender diversity in the questioners, which is not happening yet. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3450.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so let meâ€”I will start here with my colleague, Professor Eris Manela. Please. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3455.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. A brief question. How concerned is Saudi leadership about Iran, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3460.7400000000002s)]
*  particularly about the Iranian nuclear program? And what does the Saudi leadershipâ€”what [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3467.1s)]
*  would it like to see in terms of the policies of the new incoming administration toward [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3472.98s)]
*  Iran? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3479.14s)]
*  You want me to answer this or collect questions? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3479.98s)]
*  Would you like me to collect questions? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3484.22s)]
*  I'd love to. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3485.3399999999997s)]
*  Why don't we answer that question? Because that's something I should have asked, but [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3486.5s)]
*  of course, Eris asked it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3489.5s)]
*  We've gone through our ups and downs with Iran since the Iranian Revolution. It started [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3492.38s)]
*  in 1979. When Khomeini came to power, he wanted to bring down all of the so-called monarchic [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3498.38s)]
*  regimes in the area after he successfully brought down the monarchy in Iran. And we [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3505.58s)]
*  went through a tense period of relationship between us, culminating in the break of relationship [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3514.06s)]
*  when Khomeini instigated the pilgrims that come to Mecca every year from Iran to attack [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3519.94s)]
*  the Holy Mosque in order to take it over in 1984 or 85â€”maybe mistaken by a year or two [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3530.7400000000002s)]
*  there. And that led to the break in the relationship. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3539.58s)]
*  Subsequent to that, there was an effort to improve the relationship begun by the then-president [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3545.34s)]
*  of Iran, Rafsanjani, who met with our crown prince at the time, and they reached an agreement [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3555.1400000000003s)]
*  to improve the relationship. He left officeâ€”it was the last year of his termâ€”and diplomatic [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3562.14s)]
*  relations were restored. And his successor, Hamad Khatimi, actually expanded upon Rafsanjani's [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3575.54s)]
*  engagement with Saudi Arabia. I would call it the then honeymoon between Saudi Arabia [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3582.54s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3589.54s)]
*  But that's a honeymoon that's long over, and nowâ€” [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3591.3s)]
*  I have to give you the sequence in order to come to what we do now. To make the story [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3594.54s)]
*  short, I'm going to give you a little bit of a background on the relationship between [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3602.38s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Iran. To make the story short, that unfortunately began to turn sour at the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3608.38s)]
*  end of the Ahmadinejad regime when Rouhani also went through the Khober Tower's explosion [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3617.6600000000003s)]
*  that was instigated by what was then called the Hezbollah in the Hejaz, modeled after [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3628.34s)]
*  the Hezbollah in Lebanon. Saudi citizens adhering to the Khomeini philosophy, exploding [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3634.4s)]
*  a car bomb in front of towers, housing American military personnel in 1996. But there was [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3642.2400000000002s)]
*  an agreement reached between Saudi Arabia at the time, a security agreement, where both [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3655.36s)]
*  countries agreed not to interfere in the affairs of the other and to try to not allow anybody [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  to affect the relationship. Jump to 2017, I think, where the kingdom executed a Shia [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3667.7999999999997s)]
*  rabble rouser who called for a revolution against Saudi Arabia. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3681.24s)]
*  Nimr? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3686.24s)]
*  Nimr. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3687.24s)]
*  Nimr. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3688.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3689.24s)]
*  Abdullah Nimr. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3690.24s)]
*  Abdullah Nimr. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3691.24s)]
*  He was tried and sentenced and executed, and huge crowds of Iranians were allowed to attack [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3692.24s)]
*  the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the Saudi consulate in Mashhad, which led to the break [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3701.16s)]
*  in the relationship. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3708.8799999999997s)]
*  Post-COVID, the Iraqi, the present Iraqi or previous Iraqi government began to try to [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3712.24s)]
*  mediate between the kingdom and Iran at the request of Iran. And after two or three years [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3721.24s)]
*  of such negotiations that were also done in Oman, which was also mediating, and still [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3729.6s)]
*  is mediating between the U.S. and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to reestablish diplomatic [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3737.7999999999997s)]
*  relations and for the agreement to be signed in Beijing. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3745.8s)]
*  And why Beijing? It's because it has good relations with both sides. And basically, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3752.6800000000003s)]
*  I would call it that it is a kind of referee between both sides, where each side can go [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3758.32s)]
*  to the Chinese and say, look what the other side is doing, they're not adhering, etc. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3766.1600000000003s)]
*  So this is where, since that time, two years ago, I think two and a half years ago, we've [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3771.46s)]
*  had diplomatic relations with Iran. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3776.7400000000002s)]
*  My personal view is that Iran is still short of implementing the agreement that was reached [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3779.78s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Iran, particularly on the issue of interference in the affairs [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3789.06s)]
*  of others. Because we still see Iran interfering in Yemen, in Lebanon, in Palestine, in Syria, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3794.82s)]
*  in Iraq, even as far away as other places like Pakistan, etc. So that is still a work [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3804.82s)]
*  in progress. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3814.42s)]
*  But we have diplomatic relations. We have received Iranian pilgrims over the years since [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3815.9s)]
*  the previous time, but nothing more than that. And I think both sides are still tentative [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3823.9s)]
*  in how far they're willing to go in bringing the relationship closer. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3832.5s)]
*  Your other question was about? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3838.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that was his question. I mean, there's a lot more, but I have people who will subject [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3840.58s)]
*  me to bodily injury unless I call on them. So at this point, we will collect two questions. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3845.94s)]
*  We'll take two questions and then we will have Your Highness's answer and then we'll [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3850.26s)]
*  be forced to close. So my colleague here and then my colleague here, please. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3853.82s)]
*  And please be succinct in your question, because I know you. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3859.6200000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming here, Israel. My name is Roy Schwarz-Dichon. I'm a master [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3864.6600000000003s)]
*  of public policy student. I'm coming from Israel. I could ask you 25 questions. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3869.0200000000004s)]
*  He sent me 25 questions. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3873.1800000000003s)]
*  But I will make one short invitation and one short question. I agreed with many things [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3876.5s)]
*  you said. Some I disagreed. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3881.1s)]
*  I'm hard of hearing, so you have to clear up. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3883.06s)]
*  I've agreed with many things you said. With some I disagreed, but you are so nice. I assume [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3884.82s)]
*  I didn't hear you well. My first question, I would so much like to visit Saudi Arabia. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3888.78s)]
*  I assume you would like to visit Israel. Can I invite you to Israel? And my second question [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3895.06s)]
*  is you refer to that in the answer you just gave. There have been four countries that [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3901.42s)]
*  fell or partially fell under Iranian influence. I mean, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. What [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3906.2200000000003s)]
*  Saudi can make to bring back them to Saudi's sphere and more specifically Syria specifically? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3912.7400000000002s)]
*  What are you talking about? You're going to take another question. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3918.5s)]
*  We'll take one more question. Thank you for that question. Please. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3920.54s)]
*  Hi, I'm Rasha Mosleh. I'm a fellow at Carr Center here at HKS. I'm specialized in human [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3923.66s)]
*  rights and humanitarian work. My question, can you hear me? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3929.9s)]
*  Get closer to the mic. I'll just take it up. So you got a question [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3934.34s)]
*  today and I'm sure this is not the first time you get it, which is why don't Saudi Arabia [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3940.14s)]
*  and other countries come in and govern Gaza? And I guess this might be replicated in the [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3944.34s)]
*  West Bank and then we have Palestine under the Arab world, I guess. This question unfortunately [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3949.82s)]
*  shows how Palestinians are usually deprived of, first of all, that their identity is ignored, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3958.82s)]
*  that their right for self-governance, their right for self-determination is basically [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3966.46s)]
*  ignored usually. And this is not something that only Palestinians face because Arabs [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3972.1000000000004s)]
*  in general are usually lumped together, especially in the American society, in media and others, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3977.1400000000003s)]
*  as if we're one entity. And this is part of the discrimination bigotry and others that [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3982.7400000000002s)]
*  we face here. My question to you is, how do you think, what's the role that Saudi Arabia [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3987.02s)]
*  can have in changing this rhetoric here in the U.S.? Especially that we're seeing this [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3992.94s)]
*  rhetoric also in politics now where Trump would come up and just call Palestinians as [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=3998.42s)]
*  a slur. So there are this track of discrimination against Arabs and Muslims has become so mainstream [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4003.58s)]
*  and I think a political pressure needs to be undertaken in this case. Do you think that [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4011.58s)]
*  Saudi Arabia can help in this? Thank you for that question. So her question was twofold. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4019.14s)]
*  First of all, she objected to the question I asked you, which was about why isn't Saudi [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4026.86s)]
*  Arabia and other Arab countries ready to come into Gaza to help post-conflict governance, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4031.58s)]
*  to stand up a Palestinian government. She is saying that that question reveals a denigration [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4037.52s)]
*  of Palestinians and a denial of Palestinian agency, which she believes is part of a broader [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4044.84s)]
*  anti-Palestinian racism, as evidenced by President Trump's use at one point of the term Palestinian [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4050.2599999999998s)]
*  as a slur when he said Biden's a Palestinian. And so she is asking, what can Saudi Arabia [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4058.06s)]
*  do to correct that anti-Palestinian racism? Is that fair? The first question he invited [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4063.36s)]
*  you to Israel and his question was, what can Saudi Arabia do to wrest Syria, Yemen, Iraq, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4073.7400000000002s)]
*  and Lebanon from the Iranian orbit and bring it back into the Arab world and in the Saudi [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4081.42s)]
*  world? We're trying through diplomacy and through economic engagement with these countries [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4088.42s)]
*  in order to show them that there is another way of doing things than simply being so totally [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4095.1800000000003s)]
*  aligned with Iran. The difficulty there, of course, is that in these countries, Iran also [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4103.3s)]
*  depends on non-state actors that they have recruited and in many cases even imported [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4110.3s)]
*  into countries like Syria, for example. They brought militias from not just from Iraq, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4118.18s)]
*  but also from as far away as Afghanistan and Pakistan into Syria. In Syria, particularly [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4125.74s)]
*  with the other Arab League countries, we've reestablished relations with the regime and [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4132.74s)]
*  an embassy was recently reopened in Damascus. And hopefully through that contact, not just [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4140.74s)]
*  with the leadership, but with the people of Syria, that the effects of the Iranian presence [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4147.74s)]
*  can be challenged, if not downgraded, if not, you know, the effects of the Iranian presence [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4155.139999999999s)]
*  can be downgraded, if possible. And the same is true in Yemen. The kingdom now is in talking [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4162.74s)]
*  terms with the Houthis, who were at one time lobbing missiles at Saudi Arabia and Saudi [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4168.7s)]
*  Arabia was bombing them, et cetera, but we've reached some kind of ceasefire with them alongside [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4177.0599999999995s)]
*  the Israeli legitimate government, the Yemeni legitimate government. The irony there, of [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4184.06s)]
*  course, is that while Mr. Biden, when he came to power and he objected to us undertaking [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4194.06s)]
*  military action in Yemen, it is now Mr. Biden who's taking military action in Yemen against [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4201.06s)]
*  the Houthis. The same, I can say, for Iraq. There has been since three or four prime ministers [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4207.66s)]
*  ago in Iraq a growing engagement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq that is attested to by the [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4220.820000000001s)]
*  former president of Iraq here, Barham Saleh, who himself was, in my view, the one who opened [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4227.82s)]
*  the door for the rapprochement between the kingdom and Iraq when he was president. So [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4234.82s)]
*  those are the efforts that Saudi Arabia is trying to engage in. As far as the, I agree [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4242.94s)]
*  with you, it is the Palestinian people who should decide to engage in the war, and the [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4249.98s)]
*  inside, what happens in Palestine. The observation there is that the institutions in Palestine [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4257.82s)]
*  need to be upgraded, in my view. Not only in, well, in Gaza now there are no institutions [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4270.139999999999s)]
*  because of the Israeli attack, but in the West Bank you have the Palestinian Authority, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4277.34s)]
*  which needs to think of itself in terms of we have to reform how we do things and to [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4283.38s)]
*  recapture the support of the Palestinian people that has been eroded throughout the year and [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4290.66s)]
*  now is mostly very ephemeral, if I might say, in the West Bank. But I'm not an expert on [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4298.14s)]
*  Palestine, and you probably are from Palestinian Oregon, I assume. So you're probably more [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4305.860000000001s)]
*  able to tell me what the Palestinians need than me telling you what you need. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4312.9400000000005s)]
*  So, Your Royal Highness, we are now at the end of our time, and so all that is left for [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4319.9400000000005s)]
*  me to do is first of all to thank our audience, to thank those who asked questions. Thank [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4323.860000000001s)]
*  you for coming. I want to thank most profoundly you, Your Royal Highness, for honoring us with [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4331.06s)]
*  your presence here. I believe everybody here would sign on to my belief that we have just [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4338.06s)]
*  spent the last 90 minutes in communion, not just with a first rate mind, but also with [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4345.06s)]
*  somebody who has an extraordinary heart. Thank you. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4352.06s)]
*  And so thank you, Your Royal Highness, and we hope you will come back to Harvard often. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4355.78s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. May I say something before I leave you, especially for those of [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4360.259999999999s)]
*  you who are students in Harvard, and that's not to exclude the non-students, but there [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4368.5s)]
*  is a program that the King Faisal Center established called Gateway KSA. It is online. You can [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4375.5s)]
*  look it up, and you can apply to be a candidate for a visit to Saudi Arabia that would last [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4386.34s)]
*  about 10 days and be joined by other students from other countries for a tour of the kingdom [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4392.9s)]
*  and engagement in discussions and culinary marvels of Saudi Arabia, as well as discussions [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4402.5s)]
*  with your peers and with government officials and so on. So please look it up and sign up [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4409.86s)]
*  and come and visit. Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-66JXORRg&t=4418.74s)]
