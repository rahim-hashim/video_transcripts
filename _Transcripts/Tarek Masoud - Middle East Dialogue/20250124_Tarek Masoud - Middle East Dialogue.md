# Middle East Dialogues | Official Trailer
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8)
*  Welcome to the Middle East Dialogues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel has no closer or better ally than the United States. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=3.0s)]
*  And yet we cannot get them to follow through on their commitments on humanitarian aid. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=6.0s)]
*  This is a series of conversations with people who represent widely varied but widely held perspectives about the Middle East. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=12.0s)]
*  Violence can only breed violence. When violence is rewarded, things can only get worse. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=20.0s)]
*  What I don't understand is why Hamas does not bear more culpability in your view. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=26.0s)]
*  America not standing with Israel in the way that they should be led to a lot of this occurring. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=32.0s)]
*  What ceasefire agreement would you be satisfied with? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=37.0s)]
*  A good outcome is one that permanently changes the status quo in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=40.0s)]
*  At a time when institutions like Harvard have been challenged to uphold their duty to foster dialogue, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=44.0s)]
*  we seek to demonstrate that this university is in fact a place where civil discourse can thrive [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=51.0s)]
*  and tough questions are asked in pursuit of truth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=58.0s)]
*  The Human Development Index of Gaza was better than 80 countries in the world. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=62.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. Gaza's per capita GDP in 2022 was $1,000. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=67.0s)]
*  It's a time bound commitment to nonviolence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=72.0s)]
*  Is that realistic? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=75.0s)]
*  It's better than continuing to go to war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=76.0s)]
*  Join host Tariq Massoud, professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=79.0s)]
*  and the faculty director of the Middle East Initiative, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=85.0s)]
*  for a series of essential conversations not just on the conflicts in the region, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=88.0s)]
*  but on the paths toward a more peaceful and prosperous future for its people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=92.0s)]
*  Everybody, please help me because I've been trying to tell the world that we can have these conversations at Harvard like adults [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=98.0s)]
*  and we're going to succeed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=105.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIEwEr0_G8&t=109.0s)]
