# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with Ambassador Husam Zomlot
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g)
*  Welcome, everybody, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=6.36s)]
*  My name is Tarek Massaud. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=7.42s)]
*  I am a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and I'm the faculty [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=8.8s)]
*  chair of our Middle East Initiative. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=14.24s)]
*  And it's my great pleasure to welcome you today to the second in this semester's Middle [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=16.94s)]
*  East dialogues, which we have been describing as a series of conversations with individuals [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=22.68s)]
*  who hold vital and varied perspectives on the conflict that is currently underway in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=28.92s)]
*  the region and the paths towards a more peaceful and prosperous future for the long-suffering [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  people of that region. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=40.0s)]
*  Our guest today is somebody who has long been on my list to participate in this series, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=42.68s)]
*  someone I consider a personal friend, in addition to being someone who is a forceful and articulate [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  exponent of the Palestinian position during this very costly conflict, and that is Dr. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=55.64s)]
*  Hussam Zumlut. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=62.72s)]
*  Dr. Zumlut has been the Palestinian envoy to the United Kingdom since 2018. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=64.4s)]
*  He has quite a storied career that began almost 50 years ago in a refugee camp in Rafah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=70.38s)]
*  He graduated from Birzeit University with a bachelor's degree in economics, earned a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=80.8s)]
*  doctorate in political economy from London University. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=86.24s)]
*  And I got to know Dr. Zumlut when both of us started at Harvard University in 2008. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=92.0s)]
*  Dr. Zumlut was a fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center, and he was here for three years after [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=98.72s)]
*  which he had a quite meteoric rise in Palestinian public service. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  He was a spokesman for the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  He taught at Birzeit University as a professor of public policy and served as a strategic [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=115.92s)]
*  advisor to President Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=122.04s)]
*  is the political movement of which Mahmoud Abbas is the leader. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=128.76s)]
*  He was designated envoy to the United States in 2017 before becoming envoy to the United [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=133.64s)]
*  Kingdom. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  He is a scholar and a diplomat of extraordinary skill and eloquence, and we are tremendously [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  grateful to have him with us today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=149.82s)]
*  Today's conversation will proceed as follows. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=153.04s)]
*  Ambassador Zumlut and I will speak for about 45 minutes, and then we'll open the floor [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=156.2s)]
*  to members of the audience with an aim towards concluding our engagement today at around [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=161.88s)]
*  1.15 to 1.20. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=166.76s)]
*  I should let everybody know that the event is being recorded and will be posted online. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  And so if you ask a question, just note that by doing so, you are consenting to having [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  your voice and visage recorded and on the Internet for the remainder of the human experience [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=183.6s)]
*  on this planet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=192.68s)]
*  So at this point, if we were in a room together as opposed to being on Zoom, I would ask everyone [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=194.68s)]
*  to join me in welcoming Ambassador Hossein Zumlut. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  There would be thunderous applause, but unfortunately, that's one of the limitations of Zoom is that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=204.24s)]
*  our audience is unable to at this moment express their extreme pleasure at having you with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  us, but know that the sentiment is absolutely there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=217.84s)]
*  Welcome Hossein. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=221.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=222.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Professor Tariq Masood. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=223.0s)]
*  My good friend Tariq, for this very appreciated opportunity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=226.68s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  We know how busy you are, Mr. Ambassador. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  Let me just start in a way that's slightly uncharacteristic of how I've usually done [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=237.28s)]
*  these events, but that recognizes the fact that I've known you for 15 years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=241.58s)]
*  We started here at Harvard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=248.0s)]
*  I stuck around to be a humble college professor, whereas you started striding across the world [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  stage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  But in addition to being my friend, who I've watched from afar just achieve extraordinary [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=261.44s)]
*  things, you also are someone who is from Gaza. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=266.76s)]
*  Your family is from Gaza. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=270.2s)]
*  You have family there now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I did want to start by just asking you, how is your family and how are you? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=273.68s)]
*  Well, it's been very difficult, overwhelming, exhausting, draining on the, at all levels [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  and at many levels. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=287.52s)]
*  No one would have expected what has been taking place for the last 14 months or so to happen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=290.68s)]
*  No one expected that in today, in this age and time, we would see mass murder, mass destruction, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=297.12s)]
*  the use of starvation as a weapon of war, the use of the lack of medical treatment as [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=307.0s)]
*  disease as a weapon of war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=314.8s)]
*  So it's a very hard moment for people like you, Professor Masoud, and all our students [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=318.08s)]
*  here, but let alone if all that is about your own people and your own family. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=324.56s)]
*  So it's been difficult and of course, difficult most to our people that we are following, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=330.12s)]
*  watching, trying to do what we can, feeling despair, feeling anger, feeling hurt, feeling [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=336.72s)]
*  trauma really, but they are going through a war of extermination. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=342.56s)]
*  So my family has been affected directly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=348.68s)]
*  I have lost several, several members of my own extended family, but so is every single [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=351.6s)]
*  family in Gaza. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=358.56s)]
*  And that's when you know it is a war of extermination, it targets everyone. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=359.56s)]
*  It is mass violence on everybody and not just lives. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=363.72s)]
*  And we've lost more than 100 from my own family, extended family, and my wife's. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=369.04s)]
*  And if you remember the famous image that shocked the world of a girl dangling outside [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=375.6s)]
*  her home, her name was Sidra, that's the first cousin of my wife. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  Sidra Hassouna. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Sidra Hassouna, that's the first cousin of my wife. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  And only a few days ago, I lost another child of my family, Mounir Zornouti, he was five [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  years old. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  in his home when an Israeli strike hit the home opposite their house and the shaman penetrated [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=400.96s)]
*  his very small young skull and he succumbed a few hours later to his wounds. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  So the loss of lives is unprecedented, but also the loss of livelihoods. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  So my extended family, so is every other family in Gaza, has seen unprecedented levels of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=419.84s)]
*  targeting livelihoods. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=425.52s)]
*  Homes means the destruction of homes, of schools, hospitals, universities, I'll give you just [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=427.92s)]
*  one example. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=434.92s)]
*  Now the UN documents that more than 66% of Gaza's structures, all the structures, have [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=435.92s)]
*  been decimated. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=442.12s)]
*  Now of that, 70% are homes, gone, 80% of schools destroyed, 90% are hospitals bombarded, and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=443.12s)]
*  100% of universities, UNI, are shared a long time at the university and the significance [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=452.4s)]
*  of universities. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=459.0s)]
*  All universities in Gaza has been destroyed. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=460.0s)]
*  So it is rather a very difficult, difficult moment for a nation to go through this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=462.08s)]
*  And the biggest, biggest injury for a nation is to go through such a mass murder and what [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=468.28s)]
*  the International Court of Justice described as possibly genocide. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  And now Israel is on trial for the crime of all crimes for committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=480.52s)]
*  Thank you, Hossein, for sharing that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=489.28s)]
*  So I'm going to do one thing that I don't typically do, which is just state where I [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=491.52s)]
*  stand on these issues because as the ambassador and I have agreed, I'm going to try to conduct [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=498.84s)]
*  as tough an interview as one can conduct of a friend. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=506.56s)]
*  My own view is given what you have described and what has been documented is that we are [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=510.4s)]
*  now well past the point where there should be a ceasefire. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=516.88s)]
*  We could disagree about Israel's response to what happened on October 7th. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=520.12s)]
*  I happen to believe that it did have a right of self-defense, but that has been, we are [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=526.4s)]
*  well past that now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=532.76s)]
*  And so I am very eager for there to be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=534.36s)]
*  And so I will ask you, Ambassador Zumwit, last week, President Trump was elected to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=539.28s)]
*  a second term and he has made noises about wanting this conflict to end, noises that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=545.04s)]
*  you could say are adjacent to the call I just made for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=553.8s)]
*  He's also the man who moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, who recognized Israel's annexation [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  of the Golan Heights. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  He's the one who proposed a deal of the century that you, Mr. Ambassador, called, quote, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=565.62s)]
*  one of the biggest scams in modern history. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=569.74s)]
*  On the flip side, this is also a gentleman who said to an Israeli reporter, Barak Ravid, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=572.92s)]
*  about your President Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=578.28s)]
*  He said, I thought he was terrific. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=580.18s)]
*  He was almost like a father, couldn't have been nicer. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=582.74s)]
*  I thought he wanted to make a deal more than Netanyahu. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=585.94s)]
*  So how are you feeling about the Trump administration and about what it might do to end the deal? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=589.42s)]
*  The conflict? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=595.66s)]
*  What matters here, Tariq, is the policy side rather than individuals and personas and all [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=596.66s)]
*  that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=604.74s)]
*  And, you know, there is a very clear, written in stone policy by an international consensus. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=605.74s)]
*  That policy has been there for years. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=614.66s)]
*  That vision that has been written also in international law in numerous U.S. Security [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=617.5s)]
*  Council resolutions. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=622.46s)]
*  And that has been the long held U.S. policy. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=624.02s)]
*  And that vision is very simple. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=626.94s)]
*  We need to see an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian land. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=628.86s)]
*  We need to see a dismantlement of all the illegal settlements. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=635.58s)]
*  And we need to see third parties to help in that direction, by the way. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=639.5400000000001s)]
*  That was the ruling of the International Court of Justice. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=642.98s)]
*  It was a very clear cut ruling. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=645.34s)]
*  And I'm sure that together with us today, there are students of law, maybe experts of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=647.06s)]
*  law. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  The International Court of Justice is the highest judicial entity we have in this globe. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  And we established it as a community of nations for that purpose, to look into issues between [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=659.66s)]
*  states. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=666.3s)]
*  And therefore, the ruling is very important. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=667.3s)]
*  Israel's continued presence in the occupied territory is unlawful. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=670.54s)]
*  Israel's illegal settlements are unlawful war crimes and must be dismantled. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=674.02s)]
*  And all the settlers must return, evacuate, and thirdly, all third parties must cease [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  to provide any legal, political, or material support to Israel's illegalities. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=684.18s)]
*  Now, this is the international consensus. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=690.06s)]
*  That's why I'm quoting the International Court of Justice that was voted in the UN General [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=692.26s)]
*  Assembly with overwhelming support by world nations. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=695.86s)]
*  Except one. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=701.34s)]
*  Except one member state of the UN. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=702.5s)]
*  That is Israel. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=704.74s)]
*  That is Israel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=705.74s)]
*  One exception. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=706.74s)]
*  And it's very clear what Israel has up its sleeves right now. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=707.74s)]
*  It is happening in Gaza. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=712.82s)]
*  It is happening in the West Bank. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=714.66s)]
*  It is happening in Jerusalem. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=716.06s)]
*  The first, what they're doing in Gaza is very clear. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=718.26s)]
*  Some people say Israel doesn't have a plan, doesn't have a strategy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=721.18s)]
*  Look, it's, you know, what is the end game? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=723.98s)]
*  No, it has a plan. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=725.98s)]
*  And the plan is to depopulate Gaza. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=726.98s)]
*  Now they have completely depopulated the north of Gaza. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=729.06s)]
*  That's more than one third of what already very small territory that is the most dense [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=732.9s)]
*  on earth. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=738.8599999999999s)]
*  And you know the statistics. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=739.8599999999999s)]
*  And they're going house by house. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=741.8599999999999s)]
*  You asked me about my extended family. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=746.18s)]
*  Most of them live in the north of Gaza. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=747.6999999999999s)]
*  Killing actually the male population, the male members of any family, and leaving children [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=750.06s)]
*  to go through that death march towards the south because death march means that they [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=756.9s)]
*  are still being bombarded and airstrikes while they are going in that way. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=763.1800000000001s)]
*  And many of them are losing their lives. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=766.9s)]
*  And then the plan also is to keep pushing and pushing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=768.82s)]
*  So Israel has a permanent military presence in Gaza. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  Permanent. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=774.46s)]
*  They are building infrastructure. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=775.46s)]
*  They are building roads and what have you. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=776.46s)]
*  And they're doing the same in the south, by the way. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=779.6600000000001s)]
*  The city of Maiba is also being depopulated, is being destroyed completely. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=782.5s)]
*  So they squeeze our people right in the middle, the 2.3 million people right in the middle [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=788.42s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=794.22s)]
*  And the eventual plan for them in Gaza is very clear. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=795.22s)]
*  It is the mass expulsion. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=798.8199999999999s)]
*  It is the repeat of the Nakba of the 1947-48. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  But in the West Bank, you may have heard Smotrich, who is the finance minister, effectively [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  is the landlord between parentheses of the West Bank, of the occupied West Bank. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=810.22s)]
*  He declared two days ago that Israel will annex the occupied West Bank by 2025. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=816.26s)]
*  That's next year. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=824.02s)]
*  He hints that because of President Trump assuming office, starting the inauguration and all [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=825.02s)]
*  that, that this is the year that they will annex the occupied territory. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=831.34s)]
*  So why I'm describing all that, Professor? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=835.26s)]
*  Because this is the time when we press ahead with a very clear vision and isolate that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=839.58s)]
*  very clear anti-peace, anti-resolution, which comes only from one direction, Natalia. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  If the new administration in the White House would go with the international consensus, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=854.38s)]
*  would go with the promise of President-elect Trump himself. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=859.34s)]
*  Because I have heard that, so did the world, during the election campaign, promising two [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=863.14s)]
*  things, and he repeated these promises. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=867.38s)]
*  He promised to stop the killings, and we would be with him in that, and the killings must [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  stop. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=875.8599999999999s)]
*  That's the top priority. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=876.8599999999999s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=877.8599999999999s)]
*  And he promised to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=878.8599999999999s)]
*  However, this is an opportunity to say that peace in the Middle East must be based on [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=882.42s)]
*  international consensus, on international legality, and it cannot be dealt with from [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=889.78s)]
*  the present, or the angle of persons and individuals. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=895.98s)]
*  I'm going to try to channel what I think an Israeli or somebody who is more sympathetic [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=899.9s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu's policy might say in response to what you just offered, Mr. Ambassador. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=911.82s)]
*  They would say, look, October 7th was a very clear demonstration of what would happen to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=920.14s)]
*  us in Israel if the, quote unquote, international consensus that gives sovereignty to the Palestinians [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=927.14s)]
*  over the West Bank and Gaza is acted upon. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=934.3399999999999s)]
*  What people are not recognizing is that Palestinians do not accept any Israeli sovereignty in any [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=938.0999999999999s)]
*  of the land between the river to the sea and any piece of land where Palestinians are allowed [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=945.0600000000001s)]
*  to govern themselves will become a staging ground for gruesome attacks against Israeli [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=950.34s)]
*  civilians. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=955.94s)]
*  And so consequently, Israel has to do what it's doing in Gaza. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=956.94s)]
*  It has to make Gaza completely open before the Israeli defense forces. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=961.78s)]
*  Otherwise, the alternative is just continued October 7th, continued bombings, et cetera. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=967.02s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=973.98s)]
*  Number one, we leave the 7th of October and the events of the 7th of October to the ICC [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=976.46s)]
*  because we, the state of Palestine, recognized by the majority of the world, are members [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=986.4200000000001s)]
*  of the ICC. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=990.46s)]
*  We ratified the Rome Structure and we asked the ICC, that is the International Criminal [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=991.46s)]
*  Court, to investigate any war crimes committed in the occupied land of the state of Palestine [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=996.1s)]
*  since 2014. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1002.3s)]
*  So we want them to investigate all war crimes by anybody and all through. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1004.4599999999999s)]
*  And we said that we will fully respect, fully respect the provisions, the ruling of the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1009.3399999999999s)]
*  International Criminal Court. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1018.14s)]
*  Now guess who blocks us from that? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1020.02s)]
*  It's Israel and its backers. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1024.02s)]
*  Go and visit the US Congress resolutions, laws, legislations to prevent us from going [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1027.58s)]
*  to the ICC. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1033.46s)]
*  In fact, you quoted that I was the ambassador to the US. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1034.46s)]
*  The Palestinian mission to the UK was shuttled down because the PLO actually acceded to the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1039.4199999999998s)]
*  Rome Structure and went to the ICC. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1046.1399999999999s)]
*  That was the legal pretext. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1048.58s)]
*  You see the punishment. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1050.5s)]
*  But why the mission to the US was shuttled? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1051.5s)]
*  Yes, to the US. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1054.58s)]
*  Yes, it was shuttled because we went to the sort, justice and accountability at the ICC. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1055.58s)]
*  Now the question here, why Israel is so obsessed and blocking us? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1063.3s)]
*  Because Israel knows once this matter reaches international judicial institutions, once [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1067.02s)]
*  it reaches the highest court in the globe, they know that they will be in the red. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1073.6599999999999s)]
*  They know that they will be accused of committing war crimes for 76 years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1079.98s)]
*  Because international law is very clear, very clear. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1085.26s)]
*  International law does distinguish between a just war and justice in war, i.e. a just [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1088.98s)]
*  war that people have the right to defend themselves if their land is being stolen, if their rights [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1098.54s)]
*  are being denied and blocked, etc. etc. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1103.7s)]
*  If they are subjugated, if they are oppressed, people have the right to resist. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1106.3799999999999s)]
*  Now justice in war means that there are rules of how do you do that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1111.62s)]
*  That's why we have committed completely and utterly to the provisions of international [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1115.78s)]
*  law. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1122.3s)]
*  But I refer you back to what the UN Secretary General said about the 7th of October. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1123.3s)]
*  He said that this did not happen in a vacuum. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1129.1399999999999s)]
*  And yes, he was right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1132.4599999999998s)]
*  Because on the 6th of October, already the UN has reported that that was the deadliest [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1134.38s)]
*  year for Palestinian children on record in the West Bank. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1141.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm not talking about Gaza, Tareq. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1146.98s)]
*  I'm talking about the West Bank, the deadliest. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1149.0200000000002s)]
*  And I don't need to tell you what was the context in which all this happens. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1152.74s)]
*  However, we leave the actual situation to the international courts to deliberate and [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1157.46s)]
*  come up with a solution. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1162.9s)]
*  And when we see members of the US Senate and members of the US Congress sending a letter, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1164.42s)]
*  open letter, to the ICC Prosecutor General, literally blackmailing him, threatening him, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1171.38s)]
*  a mafia like Sopranos, telling him if he pursue Israel in the court, they will go after him [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1178.46s)]
*  and his family, after the families of all the judges. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1185.98s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1189.3s)]
*  So the answer to your question must be in the Hague. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1190.54s)]
*  The Hague, i.e. the ICC, must come out and answer all these legal questions because we [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1194.86s)]
*  need clarity and all of us need clarity in this regard. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1200.58s)]
*  You know, just so that I can make sure that I properly understood Your Excellency's answer [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1204.8999999999999s)]
*  to the question, which was really about, you know, how could we guarantee to Israelis that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1209.8999999999999s)]
*  things like October 7th wouldn't happen again? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1218.9s)]
*  What I understood you to be saying is that, number one, October 7th and that kind of terrorism [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1220.74s)]
*  is a function of the occupation. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  I think I understood you to be saying that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1231.46s)]
*  The second thing I understood you to be saying, but maybe a little bit elliptically, is that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1234.14s)]
*  though Palestinians, in your view, have a right, absolute right to defend themselves [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1241.3000000000002s)]
*  against the occupation, there is not an unlimited right to do anything in the course of self-defense. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1245.3s)]
*  And so you are open to an investigation of what happened on October 7th for violations [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1254.3s)]
*  of justice in the conduct of the Palestinian right, in your view, to resistance. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1261.3799999999999s)]
*  And so the way Your Excellency answered that question, you know, just illustrates the difficulty [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1268.5s)]
*  that Hamas poses. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1278.3s)]
*  You know, Your Excellency didn't say, for example, October 7th, Hamas absolutely committed [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1281.98s)]
*  crimes and those crimes need to be held as accountable for those crimes as Netanyahu [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1288.42s)]
*  needs to be held accountable for his violations of the rights of civilians in Gaza. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1294.58s)]
*  And so what I kind of want to do is talk a little bit about Hamas and so that our students [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1299.5s)]
*  and the people watching this can understand how you, a Palestinian official, views that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1306.1799999999998s)]
*  organization, consequently how we should. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1313.5s)]
*  So there's a big debate about Hamas. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1315.54s)]
*  There are some who say this is an organization that has to be part of the governing formula [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1318.26s)]
*  in Palestine going forward, that there's no solution to this problem that does not [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1323.58s)]
*  include Hamas. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1329.06s)]
*  There are others who say that Hamas is the equivalent of Daesh, of ISIS. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1331.02s)]
*  It's a terrorist organization. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1334.6599999999999s)]
*  Marco Rubio said it has to be eradicated. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1336.46s)]
*  David Brooks of the New York Times last year wrote that, quote, if this war ends with a [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1339.74s)]
*  large chunk of Hamas in place, it would be a disaster. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1343.34s)]
*  Now I'm assuming that you don't agree with people like David Brooks or Marco Rubio, but [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1347.34s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1353.6200000000001s)]
*  Does that mean that you think Hamas should be part of the government, that it should [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1354.6200000000001s)]
*  be part of the solution? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1358.74s)]
*  Well, I think what we need to focus on is what are the forces that take us forward right [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1361.7s)]
*  now. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1370.6200000000001s)]
*  How can we build a pathway towards the results or goals so we don't get lost in details here? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1372.06s)]
*  However, I told you very clearly that we are the ones who wanted to hold everybody accountable [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1383.4199999999998s)]
*  as a state of Palestine. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1390.3s)]
*  And I said clearly everyone accountable. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1392.1399999999999s)]
*  But we are blocked by Israel because Israel and Washington. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1396.06s)]
*  I mean, Israel and the US. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1400.6599999999999s)]
*  They know the clarity of international law. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1403.26s)]
*  That's on the one hand. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1406.3799999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, you know, like every other country, we have people, we have a land occupied, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1407.3799999999999s)]
*  and we have functioning national institutions. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1416.3s)]
*  We have the state of Palestine that is recognized by the majority of the world that has a seat [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1418.98s)]
*  in the UN because of the US veto. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1423.06s)]
*  We are not a four member state, but we are a state in the UN and that state has a government [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1425.3s)]
*  and that government is the PLO, the Palestine Liberation Organization. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1429.94s)]
*  By the way, you mentioned that I was part of the team in 2011 when we went to the UN. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1434.1000000000001s)]
*  When we submitted our application to the United Nations, we clearly stated that the government [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1440.74s)]
*  of the state of Palestine is the Palestine Liberation Organization, is the PLO, and the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1445.7s)]
*  PLO is the umbrella that represents every Palestinian. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1450.1000000000001s)]
*  Now that umbrella remains, you speak to me today from the PLO office in London because [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1453.5s)]
*  the UK recognizes the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1459.54s)]
*  So does the US, by the way, until the first Trump administration shut down our office, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1464.74s)]
*  but it was the PLO office. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1470.34s)]
*  The PA was established by the PLO to undertake the responsibilities of the PLO under the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1472.58s)]
*  Oslo Accords. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1479.1399999999999s)]
*  So the PA is not an entity that represents all Palestinians. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1479.86s)]
*  Should Hamas be brought into the PLO? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1484.1s)]
*  And therefore, the Palestinian people will have to decide that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1486.66s)]
*  The Palestinian people will have to decide that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1490.5s)]
*  And we will not allow for any outside interference in this. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1493.14s)]
*  The only source of legitimacy for us is the Palestinian people. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1498.1000000000001s)]
*  Now we are going through genocide, so it's very difficult for us to convene democratic [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1501.78s)]
*  process, but we have been convening democratic processes over the years. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1506.1000000000001s)]
*  And one day we will have to go back and refer back the source of legitimacy to its owners. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1510.18s)]
*  Which is the people of Palestine. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1516.1000000000001s)]
*  So it's the people who decide. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1517.46s)]
*  And you know, Hamas is part of the social and political fabric of the Palestinian people. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  And all those who say that we need to eradicate this or eradicate that, I don't think this [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1526.5s)]
*  will take us forward because what about Smokrich and Ben-Gurion? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1532.02s)]
*  What about Netanyahu? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1535.7s)]
*  What about the Likud charter, what about the Likud charter that clearly states that Israel [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1536.8200000000002s)]
*  is from the river to the sea? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1542.9s)]
*  Should we eradicate Netanyahu and Likud? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1544.26s)]
*  Mr. Rubio, you need to answer me there. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1547.7s)]
*  What about Smokrich? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1550.02s)]
*  And now they are calling the shots. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1552.74s)]
*  Those are not just non-state actors. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1555.86s)]
*  Those are the state actors. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1558.34s)]
*  You're speaking to me about a non-state actor that is Hamas. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1560.26s)]
*  What about these state actors? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1563.7s)]
*  So this is not a conversation that will lead us anywhere. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1566.34s)]
*  This will just take us backward. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1569.94s)]
*  And we should be absolutely adamantly clear that we should not look backward because if [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1572.1s)]
*  we look backward, it's all about Israel's atrocities, crimes, crimes against humanity. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1577.54s)]
*  And that's why it's crucial. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1583.78s)]
*  And I advise the Israelis not to be obsessed about security only because this is the wrong [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1584.98s)]
*  way to go. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1591.78s)]
*  Security is an outcome. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1592.82s)]
*  It is not a precondition. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1594.4199999999998s)]
*  It's an outcome of resolution. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1596.34s)]
*  It's an outcome of acknowledging what happened to people. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1598.58s)]
*  It's an outcome of realization. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1602.5s)]
*  It's an outcome of admission. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1604.58s)]
*  And it's an outcome of acceptance, acceptance of people's rights. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1606.74s)]
*  You cannot, no way in such a situation of gross denial of people's basic, basic rights, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1610.74s)]
*  the right to self-determination, the right to go back to return to your homes and properties, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1618.42s)]
*  to your farms, to your lives, and the right to be equal under any law. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1623.7s)]
*  And you know what is happening right now in the occupied territory, in Palestine, in the [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1627.78s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1631.94s)]
*  It is a combination, a complex system of military occupation, of colonialism, and of apartheid, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1632.58s)]
*  very well documented by the Human Rights Watch in the US, by the Amnesty International here [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1639.54s)]
*  in the UK, by Israeli human rights organizations, Bezalim, and numerous Palestinian human rights [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1644.66s)]
*  organizations and other international institutions. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1650.42s)]
*  So in the face of this, it is us who need to answer the question about the right to [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1653.62s)]
*  self-defense. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1660.34s)]
*  And I have been saying this, that of course countries, states have the right to defend [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1661.78s)]
*  themselves, but once they have defined their borders, what Israel is doing in Gaza and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1666.7399999999998s)]
*  the West Bank and Lebanon now is defending its expansion. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1671.86s)]
*  It's defending its colonialism. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1675.3s)]
*  It's defending its apartheid system in the West Bank. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1677.1399999999999s)]
*  It's just defending this supremacy that the likes of Smotrich and Bigfear wants to impose [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1680.42s)]
*  on the Palestinian people. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1686.42s)]
*  That does not bring security, Professor Masroor. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1687.7s)]
*  What brings security is the realization among Israelis that they cannot do this permanently. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1691.22s)]
*  So, you know, Your Excellency, I mean, I don't think I disagree with your evaluation of Ben [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1698.3400000000001s)]
*  Ghaffir or Smotrich or even Benjamin Netanyahu, but I do want to just try if I can to help [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1707.78s)]
*  our students understand something. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1717.94s)]
*  So, you know, the question I'm asking you about Hamas and why Hamas represents such a conundrum [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1719.94s)]
*  for those of us who are observing this and our students is because, you know, what many [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1728.58s)]
*  of our many people remember about Hamas is that this is an organization that in 27 mounted what, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1737.38s)]
*  you know, many people would describe. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1744.9s)]
*  I would certainly describe as a coup against President Abbas expelled your group, FATAH, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1746.5s)]
*  from Gaza entirely. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1752.98s)]
*  You can watch videos online of the extreme violence that Hamas used against Palestinians. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1754.5s)]
*  The famous videos of FATAH operatives being thrown off of buildings. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1761.22s)]
*  And so I think a student might look at your Excellency and your statements and have some [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1771.14s)]
*  trouble understanding it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1779.0600000000002s)]
*  They would think, well, wait a minute, why doesn't this person who is from FATAH view Hamas as [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1780.3400000000001s)]
*  usurpers in Gaza, people who have only brought ruin to the Palestinians and to the people of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1785.46s)]
*  Gaza? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1792.1000000000001s)]
*  Why is this clearly very eloquent, humane, highly educated and urbane representative of the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1792.58s)]
*  Palestinian people whose own group suffered at the hands of Hamas not willing to come out and say [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1799.78s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist group, what Hamas did is wrong. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1806.42s)]
*  However, that does not negate the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1809.7s)]
*  struggle for freedom. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1815.14s)]
*  Can you help our students understand that puzzle? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1815.94s)]
*  Well, of course we have our disagreements and our issues, big issues with Hamas. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1824.0200000000002s)]
*  It's public. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1828.5s)]
*  It's not a secret. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1829.14s)]
*  What you just described, the coup d'etat has been the bleakest moment in our history and [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1830.26s)]
*  has really severe consequences on the standings of our cause nationally, regionally and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1835.3000000000002s)]
*  internationally. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1840.5s)]
*  And of course, we've been at it trying to resolve this issue. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1841.46s)]
*  But you asked why an individual like me would not focus on Hamas because a person like me, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1844.8999999999999s)]
*  Tareq, would want to focus on the root cause that created all this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1849.62s)]
*  I don't believe that Hamas is the cause of the conflict. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1853.3799999999999s)]
*  I believe Hamas is an outcome of the conflict and we need to resolve the root cause. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1855.86s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1859.7s)]
*  Number two, since that coup d'etat happened, since the situation and the division in 2007, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1860.34s)]
*  it was Israel and the Netanyahu mindset that has been feeding this division. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1866.1799999999998s)]
*  And you know the history. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1871.06s)]
*  You know that Netanyahu has allowed sacks of cash every single month, millions of dollars, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1872.1s)]
*  to come through his own military checkpoints and offices. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1878.02s)]
*  Because he said it in the Knesset himself, Netanyahu, he said, I am doing this because [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1882.02s)]
*  I want to keep the Palestinians divided, divide and rule, all that. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1886.4199999999998s)]
*  And you know, I want to break the backbone of any possibility of a Palestinian state. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1890.1s)]
*  So we realize all that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1896.5s)]
*  But that's why we want to focus on the root cause. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1898.34s)]
*  Because the superstructure that is creating all this is Israel as an occupying power. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1901.3s)]
*  So yes, indeed, I want to focus on it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1906.82s)]
*  Because I know there will not be a resolution. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1909.1399999999999s)]
*  There will not be the real democracy for the Palestinian people without liberty, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1911.3s)]
*  without liberation, without freedom, without sovereignty. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1916.1s)]
*  We have been trying for a long time. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1919.3s)]
*  And once we do that, once we visit the root cause, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1921.3s)]
*  then the Palestinian people will choose political representatives based on their best interests, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1924.1s)]
*  on their best interests, like everybody else. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1930.5s)]
*  Not based on emotions or reactions or feeling hurt or voting with your feet. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1932.82s)]
*  But you will vote with your brain and with your heart. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1938.9s)]
*  So if indeed you need to help me focus on the root cause, because for a long time, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1941.78s)]
*  the international community, some in the international community, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1947.38s)]
*  because Israel keeps feeding that logic, focus more on the symptoms. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1950.34s)]
*  Only if we have a better leader in the Palestinian side. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1955.7s)]
*  Only if Hamas doesn't exist. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1958.98s)]
*  Before Hamas, it was better. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1960.5800000000002s)]
*  By the way, do you know that the PNO still designated as a terrorist organization [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1962.26s)]
*  in the US as we speak now, despite the fact that the PNO signed the Oslo agreements [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1968.74s)]
*  in the White House in 1993, despite the fact of decades of cooperation, collaboration, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1975.0600000000002s)]
*  aid coming from the US, ambassadors like myself coming and going, despite all that, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1982.5800000000002s)]
*  we are still designated as a terrorist organization. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1988.02s)]
*  Do you know that Nelson Mandela was designated as a terrorist person in the US until the year 2008? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1990.58s)]
*  Until the year 2008. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=1999.3799999999999s)]
*  So we don't want to get into these things. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2001.22s)]
*  We want to be and behave and act like statesmen, be set on the goal and walk towards that goal [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2003.7s)]
*  without all these Israel's attempts at distractions and diversions and look at this [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2011.94s)]
*  and look at that and only if we have that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2018.5800000000002s)]
*  The issue is very clear. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2021.14s)]
*  It is a military occupation that has got to end. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2023.06s)]
*  No matter how you dance around it and you try to, you know, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2026.5800000000002s)]
*  Abra ka Dabra, you know the Abra ka Dabra, like oh the issue is there, the issue is there. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2029.8600000000001s)]
*  Look up. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2034.5s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not looking anywhere. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2035.22s)]
*  But Huseim. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2036.74s)]
*  I invite you and your students to be set like I am to focus on the real issue. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2038.26s)]
*  But you know, Huseim, and you know, again, just to be transparent, I'm inclined also to attribute [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2044.66s)]
*  much of the catastrophe we're in right now to the ongoing occupation. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2052.34s)]
*  But I would be remiss if I didn't ask you the question that, you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2056.26s)]
*  is posed by many of my Israeli interlocutors. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2061.7s)]
*  They say, well, in Gaza, there hasn't been an occupation since 2006, since the Ariel [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2064.58s)]
*  Sharon's disengagement. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2073.54s)]
*  And what did the Palestinians do with that freedom from the occupation? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2076.02s)]
*  They used Gaza as a staging ground for attacks against Israel. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2081.38s)]
*  They built, they took the billions of dollars in AIDS and built networks of tunnels. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2085.46s)]
*  They built very sophisticated rockets, etc, etc. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2091.06s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2095.06s)]
*  I mean, go and ask an international lawyer, go and ask the UN itself. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2099.14s)]
*  They will tell you Gaza was not only occupied, Gaza was completely [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2103.7799999999997s)]
*  devastated because of Israel's besiegement and blockade for more than 17 years. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2109.14s)]
*  A blockade from the air, from the land, from the sea. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2114.5s)]
*  People in Gaza for more than 17 years were really [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2118.58s)]
*  what in a regime that did not allow them to exist in any way. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2121.94s)]
*  Is that regime Israel or is that regime Hamas? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2127.38s)]
*  What have you? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2130.18s)]
*  No, that regime, the besiegement and the blockade was an Israeli-imposed blockade. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2131.46s)]
*  But because Hamas was launching rockets. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2136.5s)]
*  For 17 years. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2138.98s)]
*  No, I tell you, the blockade started long before this, long before this. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2140.26s)]
*  And in fact, the Israeli attempts at separating Gaza from the West Bank [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2144.82s)]
*  started even before 2007. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2150.26s)]
*  In fact, I was a student in the West Bank in the early 90s. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2152.5s)]
*  You started by saying in Birzeit University and in the year 1993, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2156.82s)]
*  we were informed by our university that Israeli occupation territories informed them that we [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2161.2200000000003s)]
*  cannot, we cannot stay in the West Bank. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2165.94s)]
*  We have to go back to Gaza and apply for special military permits and all that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2168.1800000000003s)]
*  And we had to stay almost on a wanted list, you know, literally escaping from a place to a place. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2172.7400000000002s)]
*  So we finished our degree. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2179.54s)]
*  So the attempt to separate and the attempt to besiege Gaza and to attempt to carve Gaza [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2181.14s)]
*  out of the equation. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2187.86s)]
*  So they rid themselves of 2.3 million Palestinians who are the majority of who [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2188.9s)]
*  are refugees like myself. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2193.54s)]
*  I'd like you to remember that 80% of the Gaza population have been depopulated already in 1948. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2195.14s)]
*  Our parents and grandparents like myself, I was born in the Shabwara refugee camp because my [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2202.2599999999998s)]
*  father and mother and my grandparents were actually depopulated, were ethnically cleansed, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2206.9s)]
*  forced out of their homes. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2212.42s)]
*  So that that strategy has been going. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2214.26s)]
*  So they actually finished the job in the West Bank because the real ideological greed is in [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2217.54s)]
*  the West Bank, not in Gaza. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2223.38s)]
*  So I'm describing all that to tell you we understand the difficulty. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2225.06s)]
*  And by the way, that's why Hamas is not part of the PLO until now, because there's dialogue [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2229.14s)]
*  happening. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2233.14s)]
*  And until we reach a very solid national platform that we all agree the PLO will remain with its [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2233.78s)]
*  commitments. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2242.98s)]
*  And we are very clear on our commitments with our alliance with international legality. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2243.7000000000003s)]
*  So there was an attempt in Cairo, there was a serious dialogue in Cairo only last week. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2248.5800000000004s)]
*  There was another round in Beijing only two months ago, three months ago. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2253.6200000000003s)]
*  So we will continue the dialogue. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2257.78s)]
*  But the dialogue has to come up with a very clear outcome that will place the Palestinian [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2259.8599999999997s)]
*  political factions in where they should be, which is a national agreement, a national [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2265.14s)]
*  understanding of certain rules. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2270.18s)]
*  Now, just want to end with this. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2272.8199999999997s)]
*  Once we did that and offered the world the renewal of our democratic process in 2006, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2275.8599999999997s)]
*  and if you remember, Hamas did win that election, the legislative election, the world boycotted [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2284.02s)]
*  our government. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2288.66s)]
*  And they seized on our government. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2290.2599999999998s)]
*  So we need to make sure that we take serious steps in certain directions without harming [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2292.2599999999998s)]
*  and damaging our local, regional, and international studies. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2300.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Arsem. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2306.74s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that there is now underway an attempted reconciliation process [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2308.02s)]
*  between the factions in Palestine, and I do want to get into that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2316.74s)]
*  One thing, there's another great scholar from Gaza who I also respect, and that's the pollster [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2322.66s)]
*  Khalil Shaqqi. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2327.8599999999997s)]
*  And he's been conducting polls, surveys of Palestinians for a number of years, and most [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2329.4599999999996s)]
*  recently polls that he's been doing over the summer. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2334.18s)]
*  The most recent one, I think, was in September. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2338.18s)]
*  He shows that Palestinians support Hamas more than they support any other political faction [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2340.66s)]
*  including the one you represent, Fatah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2346.5s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2349.46s)]
*  First of all, in this dynamic, I represent the state of Palestine and the government [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2352.58s)]
*  of the state of Palestine. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2356.58s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2357.62s)]
*  Forgive me. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2359.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2360.5s)]
*  And it is important, having said that, to make the distinction, because people mix up [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2361.38s)]
*  things, to make the distinction between the following levels, four levels. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2365.46s)]
*  The first level is the state of Palestine. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2370.58s)]
*  Now, the US does not recognize the state of Palestine, and in several occasions incidents [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2373.38s)]
*  have actually objected, blocked, prevented, delayed, what have you. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2378.1s)]
*  But the state of Palestine exists. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2383.2200000000003s)]
*  Legally, it exists. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2385.06s)]
*  Politically, it exists. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2386.9s)]
*  The only prevention is that we cannot exercise our sovereignty because of the state of military [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2388.26s)]
*  occupation. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2394.42s)]
*  So you have the state of Palestine that has a seat in the UN. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2395.06s)]
*  You have the government of the state of Palestine, that's the second level, which is the PLO. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2398.1800000000003s)]
*  You have the PA, which was created by the PLO to undertake our civil services, civil [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2402.18s)]
*  services and what have you, education, health, under Osmo. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2408.18s)]
*  And then you have the people of Palestine, which have very solid and sophisticated civil [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2411.7s)]
*  society, private sector, what have you. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2416.1s)]
*  Why do the people of Palestine prefer Hamas to anything else? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2418.18s)]
*  I'm describing this. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2422.98s)]
*  So you are focusing on one limit, which is the political factions. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2423.94s)]
*  The political factions exist everywhere. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2429.2999999999997s)]
*  You tell me the Democrats and the Republicans are really in perfect harmony. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2431.7s)]
*  The political factions have their disagreements and issues. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2436.1s)]
*  The most important thing is the national structures and the constitutional arrangements that will [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2438.8199999999997s)]
*  make sure that these disagreements are sorted. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2443.62s)]
*  And the most important thing is these disagreements are always referred back to the people. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2445.9399999999996s)]
*  That's what matters because the people are the source of the legitimacy, the only source [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2450.58s)]
*  of the legitimacy. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2455.62s)]
*  As for some statistics you're quoting, you know, emotions go up and down. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2456.74s)]
*  And if you conduct the opinion polls in Gaza, it will come out a bit differently than if [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2461.8599999999997s)]
*  you conducted in the West Bank because people will judge according to their own expectations, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2468.02s)]
*  their own needs, issues of government. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2473.3799999999997s)]
*  People always punish those who are in government, whatever they are. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2476.18s)]
*  So don't rely on these statistics very much. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2480.18s)]
*  What you need to distinguish is between Fatah as a national movement, as a national liberation [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2482.58s)]
*  movement, and the PA. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2488.98s)]
*  I think many people have issues with the structures we created after Oslo simply because Israel [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2491.38s)]
*  bulldozed Oslo, completely and utterly undermined Oslo. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2497.46s)]
*  And therefore the delivery of the promises of Oslo has not materialized. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2500.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's the key thing, that these structures were created so we could actually go in the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2507.7s)]
*  direction of a state of Palestine that could provide for its people, defend its people. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2513.06s)]
*  And we failed to do that because Israel made us fail because it was from day one, since [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2518.02s)]
*  Rabin, the three attempts, since Rabin and then Barak, and then the last was Olmert, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2523.62s)]
*  we were never able to get to that. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2529.7799999999997s)]
*  And I mentioned these three because the others were not interested altogether. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2532.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, the reason... [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2536.26s)]
*  Sorry, forgive me, Your Excellency. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2537.7000000000003s)]
*  The reason I'm asking this question, then I do want to move beyond Hamas, is just, you know, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2539.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking of a kind of center-left Israeli who actually does want to have peace with Palestinians, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2543.78s)]
*  might be the kind of Israeli who inhabited many of those kibbutzim in the Gaza envelope, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2552.98s)]
*  who were actually quite progressive people who were opposed to the occupation of Palestine. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2559.38s)]
*  And those people will look at a statistic like the one that Dr. Sheqaqi discovered, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2566.02s)]
*  or they'll look at the reluctance of Palestinian leadership to condemn what Hamas does. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2575.06s)]
*  And they'll say, you know, maybe the right wing is correct when they say that Palestinians [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2581.7799999999997s)]
*  will never reconcile themselves to our being in any part of the land between the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2589.22s)]
*  river to the sea. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2596.18s)]
*  Because even after Hamas undertook October 7th, which was quite a horrific thing, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2597.06s)]
*  and consequently brought about the horrific bombing of Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2602.1s)]
*  the Palestinians are still not willing to disavow that group. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2609.22s)]
*  So I guess I'm trying to get you to explain to a potential Israeli ally of yours why this [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2612.9s)]
*  should not give them pause. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2623.3s)]
*  Because if they want partners for peace, they know the address. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2626.9s)]
*  And I think that I just described to you that Palestine has its legitimate national structures, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2629.86s)]
*  including the PLO. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2635.94s)]
*  And the PLO is very clear on its platform for a solution based on the international [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2637.06s)]
*  consensus that is ending this occupation, stabbing a state, also a state, with its [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2643.86s)]
*  Jerusalem as its capital, and resolving the right of Palestinian refugees, the right of return, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2649.2999999999997s)]
*  in accordance with international legality. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2653.94s)]
*  They're very clear. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2656.34s)]
*  And of course, equality is a very important matter. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2657.06s)]
*  Wherever Palestinians live, they have to be treated equally under the rule. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2659.2999999999997s)]
*  The right of return, you... [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2663.7s)]
*  Sorry, forgive me. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2664.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't negotiate with me, Tariq. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2666.8999999999996s)]
*  Now, this is not a round of negotiations. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2667.9399999999996s)]
*  These are inalienable rights of people. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2669.8599999999997s)]
*  These are non-negotiable rights. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2673.22s)]
*  There is the collective right of return, and there is the individual right of return. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2675.54s)]
*  The house that my father used to own is also my private property. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2678.9799999999996s)]
*  Okay? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2683.06s)]
*  And we need to find a solution not to brush people's rights under a carpet. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2683.7s)]
*  If we mean a sustainable, long-term, lasting peace, we have to answer for the rights of people. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2688.66s)]
*  But nonetheless, this is not the... [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2695.2999999999997s)]
*  But your president... [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2696.58s)]
*  Sorry, Afwan, I do... [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2697.62s)]
*  Your own president, Mahmoud Abbas, said, I believe it was in 2012, that the claims like the one that [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2699.06s)]
*  you just made are ones that he says the Palestinians should put down. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2706.8199999999997s)]
*  He says, for me, Palestine is the 67 borders. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2711.62s)]
*  That's now and forever. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2714.8199999999997s)]
*  He's from Safed. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2716.42s)]
*  I'm never going back to Safed. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2717.94s)]
*  I'm never... [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2719.54s)]
*  Are you saying something different? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2721.62s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2723.46s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2724.7400000000002s)]
*  He said that there is the individual. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2726.1s)]
*  So there is the individual rights of their own property. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2728.34s)]
*  I mean, the entire West, including the US, is based on property rights. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2732.02s)]
*  The entire place you're sitting in is based on that premise, property rights. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2736.42s)]
*  So if one person comes and says, I want my property back, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2740.1800000000003s)]
*  we will have to deal with it, Tareq. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2745.7s)]
*  We cannot just say, okay, peace has arrived. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2747.22s)]
*  There is a lasting peace finally. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2749.78s)]
*  And that one person has a claim on his own. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2751.62s)]
*  So there has to be a process. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2754.26s)]
*  And it happened before. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2755.46s)]
*  It happened before. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2757.22s)]
*  Look at the Balkans. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2758.1s)]
*  Look at everywhere. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2759.14s)]
*  And just when it comes to Israel, it becomes the exception to every rule. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2760.1s)]
*  I mean, no, we have rules that has to be applied equally on everybody. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2764.18s)]
*  And this whole idea that they don't have partners is ridiculous. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2769.62s)]
*  If they really, really want to pursue that, they will have partners in that direction. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2774.02s)]
*  And this isn't about just partners. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2779.78s)]
*  Look, the truth of the matter is people think that Israel is really after Hamas. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2783.0600000000004s)]
*  Israel is after two things. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2787.54s)]
*  It's after the Palestinian people, and it's proven. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2788.82s)]
*  Proven. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2791.94s)]
*  And by the way, let me say this. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2792.7400000000002s)]
*  On the 7th of October and then a few hours later, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2794.98s)]
*  the Israelis did not even allow us to feel anything or talk about anything. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2797.86s)]
*  They came out at the level of the president of Israel, the prime minister of Israel, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2802.42s)]
*  the defense minister of Israel, and they said, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2806.7400000000002s)]
*  Palestinian people are animals. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2809.2200000000003s)]
*  The Palestinian people are responsible on mass, and we will target them, etc., etc. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2813.06s)]
*  So of course we would be focused on protecting our people at that point in time. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2818.98s)]
*  So if you have Israeli audience in this or you are representing some of their thoughts, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2824.34s)]
*  they need to really look back, search in their souls. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2830.66s)]
*  Of course a Palestinian will be worried about his own family, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2835.86s)]
*  about his own people after that genocide that speaks. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2838.98s)]
*  We are not given a chance to even breathe because of the mindset of supremacy, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2841.7s)]
*  because Israel has decided only mass violence is the only option there, by the way, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2846.58s)]
*  which is a source of weakness. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2851.46s)]
*  Nothing left for Israel now except inflicting mass violence in Gaza and the West Bank and Lebanon. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2853.7s)]
*  And everywhere they go. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2860.1s)]
*  And if Israel wants to normalize itself in the region, in the Middle East, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2861.22s)]
*  it doesn't happen through fighting the Middle East. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2865.46s)]
*  I mean, Israel has been fighting the Middle East for decades. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2867.7799999999997s)]
*  So the Israeli psyche and mindset, this is a time for self-searching. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2871.46s)]
*  The time for self-searching because we have seen this before. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2876.5s)]
*  This has been repeated many times. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2880.74s)]
*  It's not going to produce security or stability, neither for us nor for them. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2882.58s)]
*  Your Excellency, we've talked a lot about the blame that Israel must shoulder. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2887.8599999999997s)]
*  I want to ask two questions before opening up to the audience. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2896.02s)]
*  The first question is just what about the blame that the Palestinian leadership must shoulder? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2899.8599999999997s)]
*  You mentioned, Your Excellency, that we, if I'm quoting you correctly, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2905.14s)]
*  we have been conducting democratic processes in Palestine. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2909.7799999999997s)]
*  This was by way of you pointing to the importance of the Palestinian will in directing the course [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2913.78s)]
*  of action of the country. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2921.38s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is you have a president who's 89 years old, who has been there since 2005. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2922.34s)]
*  There have been no presidential elections since then, despite the fact they were supposed to. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2929.6200000000003s)]
*  They've been postponed a number of times. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2934.5s)]
*  So what do you say to those who say, no, this is the reason that the Palestinians have been [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2936.98s)]
*  un-incapable of pressing for their legitimate rights in international fora, because they actually [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2942.2599999999998s)]
*  don't have leadership that is democratically legitimate that represents them. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2949.14s)]
*  And the reason they don't have that is because they are led by a government that doesn't look [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2953.7s)]
*  terribly different from the autocratic governments that exist elsewhere in the Arab Republics. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2959.06s)]
*  Well, what do I tell you? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2966.34s)]
*  It's part of the game. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2971.46s)]
*  It's part of the game. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2972.5s)]
*  For years and decades, Israel and some of its cronies would come and say, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2973.46s)]
*  oh, the problem is in this political leader and that leader. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2979.46s)]
*  Remember, Yasser Arafat? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2983.3s)]
*  Forget about that, Hossein. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2985.38s)]
*  Why don't you have elections? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2986.5s)]
*  They made the whole problem easier. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2988.5s)]
*  We do have elections. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2990.1800000000003s)]
*  We are one of the few in the whole Middle East that conduct elections. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2991.2200000000003s)]
*  Even Yasser Arafat, when he came back, Yasser Arafat is the father and the founder of the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2994.5s)]
*  Palestinian-Russian-Lithuanian… [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=2999.3s)]
*  So was I wrong when I said that Mahmoud Abbas hasn't run for election since 2005? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3000.5s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3006.34s)]
*  Sorry, after you. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3006.98s)]
*  Even Yasser Arafat, when he came back to Palestine, he offered himself for elections. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3007.94s)]
*  And he was, you know, he was opposed. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3012.58s)]
*  There were other candidates and he won. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3014.58s)]
*  And the same thing happened with President Abbas. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3016.5s)]
*  He offered the elections in 2005 and then parliamentary elections in 2006. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3019.14s)]
*  And we discussed international hypocrisy, international double standards when they [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3024.34s)]
*  laid siege on us because they called for elections and democracy. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3029.06s)]
*  But then when they have a different outcome, they boycotted the whole results. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3032.82s)]
*  Anyway, in our situation, there is that military occupation that controls our lives, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3036.1800000000003s)]
*  every single aspect of our lives, including the convening of national elections. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3044.26s)]
*  And we have been able to convene national elections when the occupation would not temper [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3048.7400000000002s)]
*  or intervene or block the unity of our territory and the unity of our polity. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3053.06s)]
*  That is the political system. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3058.9s)]
*  Now, of late, the Israeli occupation, because of the mindset I described to you, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3060.58s)]
*  that they are set on undermining any possibility of a Palestinian state, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3065.38s)]
*  and this is on the public record, Netanyahu and others have been saying it, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  they have been wanting to design an election process that would allow them to pocket Jerusalem, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3072.74s)]
*  to sever Gaza, etc., etc. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3077.86s)]
*  So we will not allow for elections to become the goal. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3080.1s)]
*  Elections is a tool. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3083.46s)]
*  It's a mean to an end, and the end is the unity of the Palestinian people, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3085.46s)]
*  the unity of the Palestinian territory, and the unity of our political system. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3090.1s)]
*  Of course, we have issues, but our problem is President Abbas. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3095.22s)]
*  He is the person who came out from day one saying that he wants to seek peace based on [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3099.7799999999997s)]
*  the international consensus, and he is ready for a negotiated two-state solution. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3104.98s)]
*  All these are pretexts, because when a regime like Israel is not interested in the direction [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3109.22s)]
*  that you and I want to go on, they will come up with all sorts of excuses, including, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3115.3799999999997s)]
*  oh, we don't like his height, his width, hair color, the issue is there, it's there, it's not here. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3120.98s)]
*  And let me clarify this. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3128.74s)]
*  Who leads the Palestinian people is a Palestinian matter. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3131.3799999999997s)]
*  It's our matter. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3135.06s)]
*  We don't allow for anybody externally to discuss this. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3136.34s)]
*  We have our institutions. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3140.5s)]
*  We have our demands. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3141.86s)]
*  Our people want to see the representative to be democratic. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3143.38s)]
*  This is an internal matter that must be organic and continue being organic, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3146.6600000000003s)]
*  because if it is externally, we see it as a hostile intervention rather than friendly. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3151.0600000000004s)]
*  So, Your Excellency, I have many more questions, but I think it's incumbent on me now to open the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3157.5400000000004s)]
*  floor to our audience. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3164.18s)]
*  So I'm going to ask people to raise their hand, and then I will call on people who have raised [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3166.1s)]
*  their hands in the order in which they did so. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3177.54s)]
*  While I'm collecting these raised hands, let me just ask you if you could answer as succinctly [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3181.3799999999997s)]
*  as possible. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3188.98s)]
*  Your Excellency has said that the path to peace is clear. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3192.58s)]
*  There must be recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination, the West Bank, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3197.62s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3202.82s)]
*  Let's imagine that that were granted. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3207.3s)]
*  What would the next day look like? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3212.7400000000002s)]
*  What would the Trump administration, for example, is spending a lot of time [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3214.98s)]
*  or will be spending a lot of time thinking about post-conflict governance in Gaza? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3220.34s)]
*  Many people are concerned that the Palestinian institutions have not demonstrated their capacity [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3224.7400000000002s)]
*  for self-governance. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3232.02s)]
*  So how would that capacity be demonstrated and built up? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3233.94s)]
*  I mean, there were countries that gained their independence without any capacity, and then [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3238.98s)]
*  they built it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3243.7s)]
*  You know, in Asia, in Africa, if you go back to the record, you will find some countries [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3244.98s)]
*  gained their independence without having one doctor. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3248.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I tell you what is the Palestinian capacity right now? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3251.14s)]
*  First, international institutions, including the World Bank, has already described our [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3254.5s)]
*  national institutions 20 years ago to be at the level of middle-income countries. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3259.14s)]
*  And our nation are very well known of actually building every country they go to. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3263.78s)]
*  We are made of very educated, extremely educated, one of the highest in the region, if not the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3269.0600000000004s)]
*  world. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3273.86s)]
*  We have almost zero literacy rate. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3274.9s)]
*  We have one of the highest PhD per capita graduates. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3276.9s)]
*  We have the youngest population. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3280.7400000000002s)]
*  Can you imagine, can you begin to imagine the potential for prosperity, for growth, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3282.98s)]
*  for the future? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3289.3s)]
*  The potential for prosperity, for growth, for collaboration and cooperation, for the [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3291.38s)]
*  nation of Palestine and the state of Palestine to be back, because we were once, before all [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3297.2200000000003s)]
*  this started, to be back as a cradle of civilizations. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3302.6600000000003s)]
*  And we were, and we are the cradle of civilizations, to be back the hub between East and West, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3307.38s)]
*  the bridge between East and West. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3313.7000000000003s)]
*  And I am certain that the first day of ending occupation will be a day of prosperity, a [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3315.62s)]
*  day of collaboration, cooperation, and the marriage between, you know, wealth, technology, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3322.1s)]
*  and between human resources will produce something that the Middle East has been longing for, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3330.66s)]
*  which is, you know, that people can actually have a good life and can have the basic requirements [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3336.18s)]
*  of a decent life. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3342.18s)]
*  So I am certain that the first day of ending occupation will be a day that you and I, Tarek, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3343.3s)]
*  will be celebrating. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3349.0600000000004s)]
*  InshaAllah. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3350.34s)]
*  Okay, so we have a first question from Adil Hamayzi of the Middle East Initiative. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3351.3s)]
*  Please, sir. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3357.46s)]
*  My Ambassador, hi, Professor. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3360.82s)]
*  You can hear me clearly, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3362.5s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3364.02s)]
*  Great. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3364.98s)]
*  Greetings. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3365.78s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador Hussam, Adil Maqad, Al-Jazairi, your own friend. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3366.1800000000003s)]
*  My hope, all is well. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3370.26s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3371.78s)]
*  Professor, Mr. Hussam usually tells me off for a very long question, so I'm going to [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3372.58s)]
*  follow the simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3376.74s)]
*  One thing we haven't covered on the amazing conversation is just the role of the region, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3380.5s)]
*  the Middle East, particularly the GCC, who sort of focused on the preeminent power, the US, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3386.2599999999998s)]
*  indispensable nation, the US. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3392.5s)]
*  Could you just say a little bit on your thoughts on the role of players in the region thus far? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3393.86s)]
*  What can change moving forward? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3400.98s)]
*  We saw the words from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier this week. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3403.22s)]
*  Your thoughts and expectations going into 2025. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3407.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3410.26s)]
*  Thank you, Adil. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3411.3s)]
*  Excellent question. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3412.42s)]
*  Thank you, Adil, and let me use the opportunity to convey our love to Algeria. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3414.02s)]
*  Algeria now is leading the Arab side in the Security Council, and they're doing a great [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3418.58s)]
*  job in advancing a draft resolution at this very difficult moment. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3423.22s)]
*  So our love and appreciation to Algeria. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3427.86s)]
*  As for the Arab world, Algeria is a leading member of the Arab world. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3432.5s)]
*  At the beginning of this whole thing, I have to say there was a lack of unity and clarity. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3437.06s)]
*  It's obvious, but that unity and clarity has come and it's coming. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3444.1s)]
*  It took some time. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3448.34s)]
*  We wish it was a bit faster, but it has come. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3449.2200000000003s)]
*  And you have seen the summit in Riyadh only a few days ago, and you have seen the clarity [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3452.66s)]
*  by all Arab states around that table at the level of presidents and kings and Crown Princes. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3459.2999999999997s)]
*  And you have heard the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the clarity that this is a genocide [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3466.3399999999997s)]
*  and it must end and it must end now, that there will not be a solution without the core [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3471.3799999999997s)]
*  of issues, which is the issue of Palestine, and there will not be normalization without [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3476.66s)]
*  establishing a state of Palestine. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3481.3799999999997s)]
*  But that unity needs now to bring around it bigger circles of unity elsewhere in the world, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3482.98s)]
*  main countries in Asia, in Africa, in Europe, to make sure that if the US goes in the direction [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3489.06s)]
*  of the Arab and the international consensus, we prepare the grounds. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3496.66s)]
*  If the US goes in the opposite direction, we actually isolate that position and reduce [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3500.8999999999996s)]
*  any damage possible. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3506.18s)]
*  So there is a strategic need for the Arab world to actually come together and be united. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3508.1s)]
*  And I can finally say that this is happening with a clarity that cannot be second guessed, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3513.2999999999997s)]
*  if I can use that term. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3520.8199999999997s)]
*  But also there is a need to press ahead at the humanitarian side to make sure that our [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3522.66s)]
*  people are not being killed by starvation and by the use of disease. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3528.66s)]
*  And we need to work more with our partners and brothers and sisters to make sure that [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3532.7400000000002s)]
*  Israel doesn't actually have a veto power or a permission to who eats and who doesn't, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3537.5400000000004s)]
*  who gets treated in the hospital and who doesn't. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3544.42s)]
*  This is the bare minimum and I think our work with our Arab partners is paramount in this area. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3546.7400000000002s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3553.1400000000003s)]
*  I have a question in the chat from Dr. Sophia Goodfriend. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3554.42s)]
*  So let me ask that and then I'll come to Yusuf Shahid and Barak Sela. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3558.9s)]
*  The question that Dr. Goodfriend is asking, she says, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3565.7000000000003s)]
*  the last year in the West Bank has been marked by a sharp increase in terror and military violence. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3569.38s)]
*  Alongside a security crisis, reports of financial challenges are rampant as Israel's government [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3575.94s)]
*  withholds tax revenue and donor states cut back funding since October 7th. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3582.5s)]
*  So Dr. Goodfriend is asking you, Your Excellency, can you speak about how the situation [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3587.78s)]
*  unfolding in the West Bank is impacting the Palestinian authorities' ability to govern [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3592.98s)]
*  and to operate? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3599.1400000000003s)]
*  And what do these challenges mean for plans proposed by the international community [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3600.1000000000004s)]
*  to have the PA help govern Gaza if and when the current war ends? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3606.1000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3612.9s)]
*  Thank you for that question. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3613.38s)]
*  Number one, for Gaza, there will not be any solution any day after without the Palestinian [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3615.54s)]
*  national institutions uniting Palestinian territory and people. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3622.42s)]
*  So it will only be the PLO, the state of Palestine and the PLO that will be in charge and can assign [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3626.1s)]
*  national structures to make sure that Gaza is provided for, given the calamity and given the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3633.46s)]
*  situation that you all know about. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3642.58s)]
*  Number two, you are absolutely right. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  In the West Bank, the situation is extremely and utterly critical. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3647.8599999999997s)]
*  It's at a tipping point where settlements are expanding, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3651.46s)]
*  creeping annexation is happening. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3655.7799999999997s)]
*  Remember, Smotraich is the landlord of the West Bank now. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3657.7799999999997s)]
*  Settler terrorism is on the rise, unprecedented, and you've seen only recently burning cars just [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3662.5s)]
*  a few meters away from the center of Ramallah, burning cars and homes and properties and what [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3670.1s)]
*  have you with the full tacit support of the state that is sponsoring the settlements, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3675.14s)]
*  that is Israel and the government that is sponsoring the settlements. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3680.02s)]
*  The checkpoints in the West Bank are now killing fields and not only killing physically, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3683.46s)]
*  but killing spirit and killing time and people are unable to travel, people are unable to move, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3688.1s)]
*  not able to go to their work, to their education. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3693.06s)]
*  The situation in the West Bank is becoming literally suffocating to anybody who wants [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3695.38s)]
*  to function even in a semi-normal situation. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3701.1400000000003s)]
*  But add to that what you just mentioned in your question. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3704.82s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government are on an onslaught against the Palestinian national institutions, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3707.94s)]
*  against the PA. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3713.86s)]
*  They have withheld a considerable amount of our own money. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3715.46s)]
*  This is our money, Professor, I forgot the name, sorry. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3719.78s)]
*  This is our own money. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3723.38s)]
*  And now Smotraich is also using the blackmail tool of cutting our banking sector from [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3726.42s)]
*  communicating to the world and this will collapse the Palestinian economy. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3733.7000000000003s)]
*  So the plan in the West Bank is clear. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3737.38s)]
*  They want to collapse the economy, they want to collapse the Palestinian authority, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3740.98s)]
*  they want to collapse any remnants, any symbol of statehood, any nucleus of a state. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3745.3s)]
*  So you are absolutely right. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3752.58s)]
*  And we haven't mentioned Jerusalem, which is part of the West Bank, the occupied West Bank. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3753.94s)]
*  The situation in Jerusalem is again at a tipping point because of the attempts at changing [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3758.1s)]
*  the status quo, the attempts at provoking our people in Jerusalem, the Smotraich childish [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3764.58s)]
*  approach of always provoking and always invading al-Aqsa mosque, etc., etc. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3770.8199999999997s)]
*  And all the groups and the ideologies that we are going to rebuild the temple, you know, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3775.54s)]
*  this is very, very dangerous territory and you know very well, the world knows that Jerusalem [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3780.26s)]
*  is the flashpoint. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3785.7000000000003s)]
*  If anything happens in Jerusalem, it gets everywhere in a split of a second. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3787.38s)]
*  So we hope and we really hope that your question brings everything to focus, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3791.94s)]
*  that this is not just about Gaza and this is not just about Hamas on the 7th of October. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3798.5800000000004s)]
*  History has begun 76 years ago on the one hand and on the other hand, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3803.86s)]
*  the project by Israel is much bigger and the real focus is on the West Bank. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3809.14s)]
*  And that's why we are trying our best to say what could we say to bring about regional and [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3813.8599999999997s)]
*  international alliances and to be set on the way forward rather than look backward. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3819.62s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Your Excellency, we have about 10 minutes left. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3825.46s)]
*  And so with your permission, I'd like to take the next two questions and then you could answer [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3828.58s)]
*  both of them as you see fit if that's agreeable. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3833.8599999999997s)]
*  So I will first call on Dr. Yusuf Shahid and then on Barak Sela. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3838.42s)]
*  So, Dr. Shahid, please go ahead. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3845.54s)]
*  Dr. Yusuf Shahid Thank you, Professor. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3849.78s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador, for this excellent talk. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3853.86s)]
*  You mentioned the huge Palestinian potential and the education level, which is important. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3858.02s)]
*  But politically speaking, apart from important efforts of Ambassador Hussam and some others, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3863.94s)]
*  frankly, we did not see the Palestinian political leaders. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3871.6200000000003s)]
*  We don't see Palestinian initiative. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3875.54s)]
*  We don't see Palestinian delegation that travel internationally to meet the big decision makers [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3879.94s)]
*  and bring the Palestinian questions as of the time of Arafat, if you remember that. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3885.38s)]
*  And then internally, you mentioned, Ambassador, that there is negotiation between Palestinian [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3890.1s)]
*  factions. I know that there is a war going on and we certainly can't make elections. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3894.74s)]
*  But don't you think that this is a good time and that there is a good opportunity now [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3900.66s)]
*  for the different Palestinian factions to sit together and propose a single and credible [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3904.98s)]
*  interlocutor in front of the international community? And why they cannot reach agreement [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3909.7799999999997s)]
*  through internal discussion? We don't need to wait for election. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3915.86s)]
*  Why to wait for an outside patronage? Why we cannot do it internally given the [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3920.42s)]
*  intense situation that you described? Thank you very much. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3925.94s)]
*  Dr. Yusuf Shahid Excellent. Thank you, Your Excellency. Dr. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3928.82s)]
*  Yusuf Shahid, for those who don't know, is the former Prime Minister of Tunisia. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3932.6600000000003s)]
*  I will come to now the last question from Barak Sela. So please go ahead, Barak. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3937.38s)]
*  Dr. Barak Sela Thank you, Professor, and thank you, Ambassador, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3944.26s)]
*  for your insights. Earlier in the conversation, you made a comparison between Hamas and the extreme [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3951.6200000000003s)]
*  right-wing elements in Israeli society. A difference that I would like to point out is that [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3959.78s)]
*  in Israel, while we have extremist elements there, like in any proper state around the world, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3966.0200000000004s)]
*  there is a monopoly over violence. There is one state and one weapon, as we might say, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3972.02s)]
*  under the IDF. And there is a strict structure of how to create and how to execute violence. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3977.86s)]
*  While we see in Palestinian society, there has not been a situation where there has been able to [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3985.14s)]
*  consolidate the Palestinian people under one weapon, as you would say. One of the main issues [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3991.78s)]
*  for Israelis is security assurances that we saw were breached on October 7th. So my question is, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=3997.46s)]
*  will the government of Palestine and Palestinian people call for disarming Hamas? And what are the [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4004.26s)]
*  security assurances that the Palestinians are willing to give the Israelis so that we will be [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4009.7s)]
*  able to consider removing settlements and paying the dear price that Israeli society might pay [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4014.42s)]
*  in such a situation? Dr. Yusuf Shahid [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4021.2200000000003s)]
*  Thank you for that, Barack. So two really excellent questions. The first about why the Palestinians [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4024.58s)]
*  have really been unable to unify their political ranks and identify a credible singular interlocutor. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4031.1400000000003s)]
*  And the question that Barack Sela is asking, which is what are the credible security guarantees that [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4040.7400000000002s)]
*  Palestinians can offer to the Israelis? Dr. Yusuf Shahid [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4047.14s)]
*  Thank you very much, Dr. Yusuf Shahid. Thank you for your question. And I add my voice to yours [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4052.66s)]
*  that Palestinian unity and Palestinian dialogue is absolutely crucial, strategic, needed. And no one [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4058.8199999999997s)]
*  needs it more than the Palestinian people. I mean, there are such clarity by the Palestinian people [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4065.22s)]
*  that this is the direction they want to see. And let both of us wish them good luck, because I am [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4069.62s)]
*  gathering that the conversations, the dialogue, the talks in Cairo has really picked up. And yes, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4076.58s)]
*  we need to see that unity and that clarity of Palestinian orientation. However, let me make [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4083.22s)]
*  the distinction that the Palestinians do speak in one voice. And I want to clarify this. We do [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4090.1s)]
*  have an address. The Palestinians are not without an address. The Palestinian people are not [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4096.42s)]
*  leaderless. Now we have issues, and all these issues are legitimate. We need to convene elections. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4100.74s)]
*  We must democratize reforms, all that. But we do have an address, not to mix these two things. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4106.98s)]
*  Even Hamas. Hamas wants to be part of that address, part of the PLO. But nobody says we are going to [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4113.54s)]
*  establish a new address for the Palestinian people. No one says that. And that address is the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4118.98s)]
*  interlocutor of the world. And that address needs to be the umbrella under which all these dialogues [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4124.1s)]
*  are happening. And I understand the importance. We all understand the significance at the point [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4130.58s)]
*  when your people are going through a war of extermination, that you are united. I understand. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4139.0599999999995s)]
*  But also, I also want to draw to your attention, Your Excellency, the former Prime Minister, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4145.139999999999s)]
*  to your attention that the Palestinian people are united. We are a united people. We are united in [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4151.0599999999995s)]
*  our national goals. We are united in our culture. We are united in our cuisine. We are united in [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4157.38s)]
*  everything. Every Palestinian will help for you. Where they come from, what's their best sort of [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4163.62s)]
*  culture and background. We are united. And look, whatever happens in the West Bank, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4171.46s)]
*  reflected in Gaza, and vice versa. And look at the Palestinian diaspora and refugees and [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4177.7s)]
*  those in exile. As a people, we are united. As a structure, as representation, we also have that [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4182.82s)]
*  unity. The problem is with political factions. And again, I very much support that these political [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4189.219999999999s)]
*  factions must sort their differences and come up with an agreement that really reflect the [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4195.0599999999995s)]
*  unity of our people and reflect the unity of our political system. Barak, Hamas cannot be compared [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4200.9s)]
*  to extremist elements in Israel because in Israel there is the IDF. I agree. But from the other [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4210.26s)]
*  perspective, that you cannot compare a non-state actor to a state actor. The responsibility of a [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4217.38s)]
*  state actor, Barak, is so different than the responsibility of a non-state actor. So the [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4222.820000000001s)]
*  responsibilities of a state actor are very well defined. A state has to behave in a certain manner [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4229.06s)]
*  that is in accordance with its own laws and with international law. And if that state is an [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4235.14s)]
*  occupying power, then there are all sets of rules that are very clear that they have to provide for [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4241.14s)]
*  the people under their occupation, not starve them. If the IDF uses starvation, this is way worse than [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4247.06s)]
*  any other crime. So the monopoly of the use of power, the monopoly of the use of violence, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4254.26s)]
*  was created so it is regulated. So it doesn't get in the hands of groups and entities so they [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4261.46s)]
*  inflict on all of us. That's why the state was entrusted to be the best holder of that monopoly [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4268.9s)]
*  of violence. But in Israel's case, that is absolutely and utterly misused, abused in a way [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4275.86s)]
*  that has turned the whole machine into a machine of mass violence. So yes, a state actor has to be [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4282.66s)]
*  hold and be hold to certain standards that I have to tell you, Israel has completely and utterly [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4289.46s)]
*  violated every single human rule and every single international rule here. But as for issues of [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4297.46s)]
*  security, I'll tell you one thing from my heart. You cannot begin to discuss structures of security, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4305.22s)]
*  of economic cooperation, of prosperity, of stability without resolving the issues. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4315.78s)]
*  Boating the horse before the cart is a business that has gone on for 30 years and look where we [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4321.94s)]
*  are today. You mean the cart before the horse? The cart before the horse, yes, sorry. You cannot [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4327.62s)]
*  book the cart before the horse. Thank you, Tarek, for correcting me. And you know, in this incident, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4333.219999999999s)]
*  the cart is security and for 30 years Israel wants security while they are in full control [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4340.74s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, full control, full military occupation. And guess what? Guess what [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4347.46s)]
*  I'll add to you. They also expect that the Palestinian people will provide security for [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4352.9s)]
*  them while being under occupation, under the full security control of the occupier. So we should [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4358.58s)]
*  provide security, not only for the Israeli occupying forces, but also for the settlers. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4364.34s)]
*  This logic has not worked and it will not work. And that's why it's very important that we remove [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4370.42s)]
*  ourselves from that doctrine, from that framework of thinking, because it's not going to lead [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4377.06s)]
*  anywhere. And we bought ourselves like every other case. Look at what happened in Northern Ireland. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4382.02s)]
*  Look at the Northern Irish experience. Look at the Balkans and what happened there. Look at South [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4389.06s)]
*  Africa. Look at East Timor. I can quote you many, many examples. Security, peace, prosperity, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4393.7s)]
*  cooperation, open borders, all happen once you resolve the political issues. Once political [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4401.86s)]
*  leaders come around the table and really realize that this is the building block, the cornerstone [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4408.5s)]
*  for all the above. So let's not keep talking about the cart all the time. And I assure you, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4414.5s)]
*  and go back to the Arab peace initiative, go back to the piano statements, go back to what [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4421.22s)]
*  happened over the last 30 years. I assure you that once a political resolution is reached, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4427.700000000001s)]
*  security arrangements, economic arrangements, all that, including normalization, will be reached on [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4433.9400000000005s)]
*  solid grounds. The other way around simply doesn't work. Your Excellency, we have only scratched the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4441.780000000001s)]
*  surface of what we could talk to you about. I have in the chat dozens of superb questions [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4449.86s)]
*  that we could pose to you, all of which is to say that Your Excellency owes us an in-person [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4458.82s)]
*  visit to your old stomping grounds at Harvard so that we can continue this conversation. I have in [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4466.58s)]
*  my head maybe the overly optimistic idea that I could even have you sit down with some of our [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4472.98s)]
*  students from both Palestine, but also students from Israel, and have a kind of meeting of the [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4481.86s)]
*  minds and hearts about how we can bring this conflict to an end. All I have to do now is thank [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4487.86s)]
*  you. I think everybody who attended this event now knows that they have in you not just a [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4496.1s)]
*  formidable intellect, but someone who is fundamentally humane and committed to the coexistence side by [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4503.620000000001s)]
*  side of the Israeli and the Palestinian people. I hope that when you do come and visit us at Harvard, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4511.38s)]
*  the bloodshed currently underway will be at an end, and the process of healing will have begun [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4520.26s)]
*  a process that I know Your Excellency will play a leading role in. Thank you. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4526.66s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Professor Masouda. Thank you all. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4531.62s)]
*  Thank you all. I want to thank the audience. I want to note that we'll be meeting again on Zoom [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4535.0599999999995s)]
*  December 19th to speak with Sippy Livni. Thank you all for your excellent questions. Thank you to [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4541.38s)]
*  His Excellency. Thank you to our team at the Middle East Initiative, including [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4548.74s)]
*  Paige Ferreira and Julia Martin, who produced this event. And God willing, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4552.82s)]
*  we'll see you all again soon. Thank you. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzm1xoLFy0g&t=4557.54s)]
