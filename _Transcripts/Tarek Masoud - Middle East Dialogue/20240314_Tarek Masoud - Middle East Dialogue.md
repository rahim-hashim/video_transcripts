# Middle East Dialogues: Matt Duss in conversation with Tarek Masoud
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU)
*  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the second in our series of Middle East dialogues, which we are describing as [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4.4s)]
*  a series of conversations with individuals who hold varied and vital perspectives on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=11.56s)]
*  the current conflict in Gaza and Israel and on U.S. policy in the Middle East more broadly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=17.48s)]
*  We have with us today a really extraordinary guest, and that is Mr. Matt Duss, who is the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=25.04s)]
*  executive vice president of the Center for International Policy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=32.44s)]
*  Matt Duss is really one of the foremost progressive voices on U.S. foreign policy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  He's been working in this area for a number of years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  He was, from 2017 to 2022, the foreign policy advisor to Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=46.34s)]
*  From 2014 to 2017, he was the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=52.28s)]
*  he is just really one of the most thoughtful, eloquent progressive voices on U.S. foreign [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  policy generally. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=65.76s)]
*  He's also somebody who I share a slight connection with, I wish I shared more of a connection [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=68.08s)]
*  with in that he was actually a student of a scholar that I admired and knew a little [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=74.92s)]
*  bit, the great Ellis Goldberg, who passed away in 2019. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=80.12s)]
*  I got to know Ellis towards the end of his life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=83.88s)]
*  He was a professor at the University of Washington, and he was a scholar of incredible brilliance [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=86.0s)]
*  and humanity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=92.56s)]
*  From my limited dealings with Matt Duss, it's clear that more than a few of the teacher's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  qualities have rubbed off on the student. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=99.56s)]
*  What we're going to do today is we'll talk for about 45 minutes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=102.56s)]
*  I have somebody now keeping time, and then I'm going to call on my students who have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=106.0s)]
*  submitted some questions, and then I will open the floor to the audience, and we will [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  hopefully be done by 6 p.m. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=117.56s)]
*  I want to draw everybody's attention to the fact that this event is being recorded, and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=120.16s)]
*  we may release it online. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=128.76s)]
*  If you ask a question, please be aware that you are consenting to having that question [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=130.42s)]
*  disseminated widely and for all time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  You will be immortalized as a participant in this great historic event. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  Before we get started, please join me in welcoming Matt Duss. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  All right, Matt. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=148.94s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=152.98s)]
*  I want to obviously start with the war in Gaza and Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=154.76s)]
*  You have labeled Hamas' terrorist attack against Israel as indefensible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  More than 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, were killed on that day. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=165.58s)]
*  More than 200 taken hostage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=169.7s)]
*  And more than 200,000 Israelis have been internally displaced as Israel's evacuated towns in the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=171.78s)]
*  south and in the north that are within range of rocket attacks from Hezbollah and from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=177.7s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=184.1s)]
*  Netanyahu's stated aim is to ensure that October 7th can never happen again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=185.26s)]
*  And yet you have been quite vocal in calling for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=191.38s)]
*  How do you respond to people who say that you are denying Israel its right of self-defense? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=196.54s)]
*  Well, thanks for that question. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=202.5s)]
*  And first, let me just thank you for inviting me and thank you all for being here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=204.98s)]
*  I will strive to live up to that introduction you gave me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=209.26s)]
*  And also, I really appreciate you bringing up my great friend and teacher, Ellis, who, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=212.26s)]
*  yeah, I will just completely agree. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=216.06s)]
*  I mean, his humanity and rigor is something I aspire to constantly, and that's how I try [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=218.3s)]
*  to honor him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=223.22s)]
*  So, to your question, I mean, of course, everything you said is something I stand by strongly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=224.22s)]
*  The Hamas attacks were atrocious. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=229.38s)]
*  They are indefensible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=230.94s)]
*  Israel has every right and responsibility to protect its people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=238.7s)]
*  The way that they protect its people, the tools they use, the techniques, the policies [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=239.86s)]
*  and procedures and the tactics matter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=243.46s)]
*  This is something we even hear from President Biden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=246.0s)]
*  Israel has a right to protect its people, as does every country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  It does not have the right to determine by itself what is appropriate and inappropriate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  There is such a thing as international law, international humanitarian law, that sets [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=259.66s)]
*  out a set of standards for the protection of civilians about proportionality. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=263.82s)]
*  I think it's very clear that Israel has, in this conflict and in previous conflicts, and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=268.58s)]
*  frankly, throughout the process of the occupation, violated a whole set of those standards. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=273.82s)]
*  So that's my brief response. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=280.14s)]
*  So let's just pull on a few of these. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=282.54s)]
*  I mean, 30,000 Gazans have been killed, half women and children. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=286.14s)]
*  But somebody, a defender of Netanyahu's policy, would say, that's not Israel's fault. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=294.46s)]
*  That's Hamas's fault. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=301.5s)]
*  Hamas uses citizens as human shields. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=302.5s)]
*  And Israel actually does take measures to try to warn people to evacuate places that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=306.02s)]
*  Israel is about to bomb. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=311.94s)]
*  But frankly, even if they didn't take those measures, what do you want them to do? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=314.26s)]
*  The enemy is hiding among civilians. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=318.14s)]
*  So should Israel not respond at all? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=321.02s)]
*  No, again, I think that's kind of a false choice there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=324.7s)]
*  I mean, it is quite true that Hamas's tactics make it difficult for Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=327.66s)]
*  Hamas did not invent guerrilla warfare. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=332.38s)]
*  I mean, terrorists or guerrillas or whatever term one wants to use, resistance fighters, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=335.26s)]
*  have hidden among civilians as long as there were guerrilla resistance fighters, including [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=340.62s)]
*  the Zionist terrorist groups who played a part in the formation of Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=345.74s)]
*  That's, again, not to say that it's simple. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=350.7s)]
*  Going back to your earlier question, though, about Netanyahu's goal, wanting to make sure [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=352.86s)]
*  that Israel never faces another attack like October 7 and it does not emanate from Gaza, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=357.42s)]
*  that is a legitimate goal. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=362.22s)]
*  But I would add that Netanyahu has stated another goal, which is the eradication of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=363.64s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there is no one, and this includes most serious Israeli security analysts, who [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  believe that that is a realistic goal. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=372.94s)]
*  You will not eradicate Hamas. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  You will diminish them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=376.54s)]
*  You will weaken them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=377.54s)]
*  And I think that's part of the challenge in determining or kind of assessing Israel's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=379.7s)]
*  response to October 7, because these important questions of proportionality relate to the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=384.58s)]
*  overall objective. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=390.34s)]
*  And if you have not set out a remotely realistic objective, it is very difficult, if not impossible, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=392.02s)]
*  to judge whether the tactics you are using to achieve it are appropriate. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=397.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=402.06s)]
*  I mean, I think if you talk to some Israeli military analysts, they'll say, look, what [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=403.06s)]
*  Netanyahu is really trying to do is reestablish. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=408.66s)]
*  He understands, he agrees with Matt Duss, Hamas is never going to go away. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=410.74s)]
*  But what he wants to do is reestablish deterrence. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=414.82s)]
*  So Hamas has to understand that the cost of things like October 7 is prohibitive. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=418.58s)]
*  To do that, you can't be proportional. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=424.82s)]
*  I mean, I love this term, reestablishing deterrence. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=428.94s)]
*  I mean, Americans use it a lot. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=431.02s)]
*  I mean, how many times do you have to reestablish deterrence before you realized you're not [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=432.26s)]
*  actually doing that? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=436.1s)]
*  I mean, people, you're here, you're studying international politics. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=437.82s)]
*  You know what the word deterrence means. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=441.82s)]
*  And if you have to keep doing it, there's something else going on. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  But getting to the question of what Netanyahu's real goal is, restate it? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I was just saying reestablishing deterrence. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=456.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=458.82s)]
*  Like you have to make the cost prohibitive. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=459.82s)]
*  I mean, this goes, again, to one of what some may know the Dahya doctrine from Lebanon. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=460.82s)]
*  Just explain it to everybody. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=467.38s)]
*  It's like... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=468.38s)]
*  No, it goes from the 2006 Lebanon War and subsequent conflicts where there has been [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=469.38s)]
*  this doctrine articulated of just massive destruction. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=472.82s)]
*  You know, frankly, explicitly disproportionate response to attacks creates such a level of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=477.41999999999996s)]
*  destruction and suffering to create that deterrent that you talked about. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=483.17999999999995s)]
*  And again, I think the important thing to note here is that this is an explicit doctrine [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=488.7s)]
*  of civilian harm. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=493.34s)]
*  Now, one can try and justify it, but I think we have to understand that this, again, is [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  a doctrine of civilian harm. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=500.94s)]
*  So you cannot, on the one hand, claim to be pursuing this and on the other hand claim, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=503.38s)]
*  well, we're doing everything we can to prevent civilian harm. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=507.26s)]
*  Those things cannot be resolved. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=510.58s)]
*  Well, you know, let me push a little bit on this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=512.46s)]
*  I mean, again, I mean, I don't want to repeat myself, but what Netanyahu would say is no, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=515.1s)]
*  This is a doctrine that is, you know, necessitated by the fact that these guys hide among civilians. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=520.06s)]
*  Hey, if Hamas had their own military bases that were removed from civilians, we would [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=528.2199999999999s)]
*  be targeting those. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  But I would say you've been pursuing this policy for well over a decade. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=535.02s)]
*  How is that going? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=539.66s)]
*  OK, fair enough. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=540.66s)]
*  What is a proportionate response to October 7th look like? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=541.66s)]
*  I think a proportionate response does target Hamas. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  It targets the people who planned and carried out the October 7th attack, which is entirely [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=547.14s)]
*  legitimate. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=551.62s)]
*  I don't mean to pretend it is simple. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=552.62s)]
*  There would certainly be collateral damage, as much as I hate using that term. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=554.54s)]
*  But what we are seeing, 30,000 people dead, Gaza turned into basically the moon, the preventing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=558.34s)]
*  of humanitarian aid. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=566.46s)]
*  And again, this is something that we know for a fact is happening. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=567.62s)]
*  The administration will say it is happening. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  In fact, there was a report that we saw just yesterday, I think from Barack Ravid, who [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=572.7s)]
*  there are discussions in the administration to airdrop aid into Gaza. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=577.0200000000001s)]
*  Now, let's think about this for a minute. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  This is the United States. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=583.5s)]
*  Israel has no closer or better ally than the United States. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=585.14s)]
*  We are arming this war. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=587.62s)]
*  We are giving them complete wall to wall diplomatic support for this war. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=589.14s)]
*  And yet we cannot get them to follow through on their commitments on humanitarian aid to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=593.22s)]
*  such an extent that we now have to consider airdropping humanitarian aid. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  Prevention of humanitarian aid is yet another prima facie violation of international humanitarian [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=602.6600000000001s)]
*  law. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  And this is not proportionate. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  This is not just self-defense. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=609.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=610.78s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=611.78s)]
*  So what do you say, you know, the Secretary of State Blinken outlined a number of principles [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=612.78s)]
*  for what the day after should look like or to get us to a ceasefire. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=619.78s)]
*  And one of the planks in these principles or one of these principles was no use of Gaza [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=625.22s)]
*  as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=631.98s)]
*  How do you achieve that with a strategy short of what Netanyahu is doing? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=635.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=640.74s)]
*  Well, I think short of I mean, tell me, tell me, OK, tell me how Matt Duss is now trying [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=641.74s)]
*  to tell the Israelis, here's a better way to deter Hamas in the future. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=648.1s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=654.1s)]
*  What is it? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=655.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a tough question. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=656.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to pretend otherwise. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=658.74s)]
*  As we wrote in the Foreign Affairs piece with my colleague, Nancy O'Kell, CIP's president, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=660.74s)]
*  Hamas is has been empowered in part because of the policies that we have been pursuing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=667.78s)]
*  and supporting. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=672.74s)]
*  It's going to be very hard, if not impossible, to diminish Hamas and weaken them. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=675.26s)]
*  They are a part of Palestinian politics as much as I don't like it, as much as a lot [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  of Palestinians don't like it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=683.32s)]
*  But you can work to make Hamas less relevant and hopefully irrelevant at some point by [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=685.6400000000001s)]
*  offering by showing that a different path offers a better future for Palestinians. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=690.72s)]
*  Again, this is a longer term process. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=695.6400000000001s)]
*  This is not going to happen within a few weeks or months. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=697.84s)]
*  There's clearly going to be an effort needs to be an effort to continue to weaken and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=701.32s)]
*  prevent attacks from Hamas. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=705.7600000000001s)]
*  But let's let's be sure that those the holes in the in the Gaza fence line, which enabled [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  Hamas to break through in such huge numbers and carry out such catastrophic, catastrophically [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  successful attacks on October 7, those holes have been filled. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=717.9599999999999s)]
*  So I do think that the situation that obtained on October 7 simply no longer exists. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=722.9399999999999s)]
*  OK, so so you said a couple of things that I want to I want to pull on. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=728.3599999999999s)]
*  The first is you made a point that I just want to get you to articulate a little bit [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  more fully where you said Hamas was empowered by policies we have been pursuing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=738.72s)]
*  What are you referring to? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, you go back to a statement from Netanyahu himself. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  He was quoted in a kind of Likud party meeting a few months before October 7, I think, where [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=747.28s)]
*  he said explicitly transferring money to Hamas. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=751.84s)]
*  I mean, literally delivering suitcases of cash to Hamas in Gaza to sustain them is important [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=755.12s)]
*  to serve our goal of preventing a Palestinian state of keeping Hamas in control in Gaza, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  divided from Fatah in the West Bank, because ultimately that is his goal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=767.64s)]
*  So so Matt Duss is before October 7th, when we're talking about funding the government [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=772.64s)]
*  of Gaza so that it can provide basic services using, you know, cut the money. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=779.04s)]
*  Matt Duss would have said, no, starve them of resources. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=784.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=787.76s)]
*  I would have taken I would have said and I can point to something that I worked on with [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=788.76s)]
*  a letter in May 2018 that he and 13 other U.S. senators sent to the Trump administration. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=793.08s)]
*  I'm not going to say they listened, but this letter was sent. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=798.08s)]
*  And this cited UN humanitarian experts, it cited Israeli humanitarian and security experts, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=801.6s)]
*  it cited Israeli military officials who said if we do not address this crisis in Gaza very [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=807.12s)]
*  soon, it could blow up into, quote, all out war. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  That was May 2018. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  That is what happened. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=819.44s)]
*  The situation was, you know, was Gaza. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  The UN said that Gaza would be unlivable by 2020. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  They said this in about 2016 or 2017. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=826.72s)]
*  What I am saying is Matt Duss would have addressed this problem before it resulted in October [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=829.96s)]
*  7th. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=835.84s)]
*  So what was the problem? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=836.84s)]
*  So I could imagine, again, you know, a supporter of the current Israeli government saying, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=837.84s)]
*  you know, you are misdiagnosing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=843.36s)]
*  Absolutely, Gaza was unlivable. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=845.68s)]
*  But it was unlivable because it was run by this mafia that preferred to use any resources [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=849.56s)]
*  that came into the territory to build rockets and to launch those rockets. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=855.68s)]
*  They could have built, you know, when people say they could have made a Singapore, I think [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=860.76s)]
*  that's just ridiculous. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=865.7199999999999s)]
*  But they could have built a much more livable place for their citizens. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=867.88s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=872.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=873.68s)]
*  So, you know, an Israeli probably at that point in time would have said, all Matt Duss [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=874.8s)]
*  wants to do is make Hamas's government's job easier. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's not my responsibility. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=883.8s)]
*  Yeah, ultimately, I don't want Hamas in government. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, that's not my... [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=889.12s)]
*  But the policy that you and Senator Sanders would have pursued, somebody would say to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=890.3599999999999s)]
*  you, oh, well, that would have, you would have handed Hamas a great victory. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  I suppose they could say that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=897.4799999999999s)]
*  But again, let's go back to, let's understand why Hamas was in, you know, control within [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=900.28s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=905.48s)]
*  And I want to make clear within Gaza, because ultimately, the Israeli military controls [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=906.48s)]
*  the entire territory. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=910.04s)]
*  Hamas took control in 2007 in a very brief but bloody civil war that was precipitated [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=912.44s)]
*  by a U.S.-backed Fatah coup attempt that Hamas got wind of and moved first. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=918.04s)]
*  And again, I don't want to pretend that the U.S. is always the primary actor. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=925.0s)]
*  It is not. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=928.4s)]
*  Hamas has its own choices to make. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=929.4s)]
*  Fatah has its own choices to make. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  The Israelis and many others have their own choices to make. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=932.64s)]
*  So I certainly do not absolve Hamas of its own choices. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=935.24s)]
*  Listen, I've been to Gaza. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=937.88s)]
*  OK, I've seen the villas that these Hamas goons build for themselves on the beach while [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=939.52s)]
*  their people are suffering. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  It is atrocious. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  I do not absolve them of this. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  But I do think that there were steps the United States could have taken that were different, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=949.36s)]
*  that would create a different process, a different incentive structure than what we had. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=953.12s)]
*  Because that gets into this question about the nature of Hamas. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  And so there are some who say, look, read the Hamas Charter of 1988. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=962.36s)]
*  They want to bring about the end of the state of Israel and they look forward to an end [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  of times war in which trees and rocks will say, Muslim, come, there is a Jew behind me, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=975.5s)]
*  come and kill him. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=980.44s)]
*  So some people say the nature of this organization was always completely rejectionist. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=981.54s)]
*  And what you're kind of saying, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, so don't [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=988.94s)]
*  hesitate to smack me down, but it almost feels like you're saying if we had treated Hamas [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=993.7s)]
*  a little bit differently, like when they got elected in 2005, if we had, instead of cutting [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=998.78s)]
*  all aid, if we had worked with them, they would have evolved into nice, happy mayors [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1004.66s)]
*  as opposed to bloodthirsty religious terrorists. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1011.5799999999999s)]
*  So I'm not saying that, and I don't want this to be just a debate about Hamas. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1016.0999999999999s)]
*  I agree it is important. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1020.2199999999999s)]
*  Now I think there were different choices that Hamas was prepared to make at various times. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1021.86s)]
*  I think the leadership of Sinwar in particular is very important here. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1026.7s)]
*  With regard to the Hamas Charter, again, it's awful. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1033.3s)]
*  It's a ridiculous offensive anti-Semitic document. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1036.34s)]
*  There is no question about that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1038.86s)]
*  Again, in some of the conversation I had with especially younger Hamas activists when I [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1040.3s)]
*  was there, they have never read the document. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1046.02s)]
*  Again, not a defense. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1048.1s)]
*  It's an atrocious document. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1049.58s)]
*  These guys wanted a job. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1051.74s)]
*  Hamas is the only game in town. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1053.5s)]
*  When I talk to them about that document, they're like, you don't support that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1056.42s)]
*  We just want a situation that's livable. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1060.66s)]
*  So again, there are some of these Hamas ideologues that fully believe that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1063.54s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1066.82s)]
*  I would encourage people to look at the Likud Charter. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1067.86s)]
*  I mean, the Likud Charter denies the right of the Palestinians to say it claims that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1069.8999999999999s)]
*  there should be one land for the Jews only between the river and the sea. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1074.1799999999998s)]
*  One could make an argument. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1078.62s)]
*  Call for the slaughter of Palestinians. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1079.62s)]
*  It does not explicitly, but I think it is very clear about who has rights and who should [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  be subjugated. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1086.4199999999998s)]
*  So again, I don't want to play a game of equivalents here, but the bottom line is if we can get [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1087.4199999999998s)]
*  a Likud-led government to actually agree to an agreement, I'd be fine with that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1091.62s)]
*  I mean, if we can get a government that Hamas is a part of to agree to an actually durable [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1096.86s)]
*  and enforceable agreement, I might not like, I do not like what Hamas stands for. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1100.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't tend to like religious conservatives generally, even though I come from a religious [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1105.46s)]
*  conservative background. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1109.94s)]
*  But you know, going back to what you talked about the 2005 election, I do think that was [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1112.78s)]
*  an opportunity. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1116.26s)]
*  And again, let's remember the Bush administration called for these elections. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1117.26s)]
*  Some people warned them, but they, you know, George W. Bush, I do not give him credit for [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1121.58s)]
*  a lot, but something I do give him credit for saying, OK, listen, he actually wanted [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1126.18s)]
*  to promote democracy in the region. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1130.5800000000002s)]
*  He was like, OK, let's have elections to generate a real democratically legitimate Palestinian [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1132.22s)]
*  leadership. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1136.9s)]
*  Hamas won. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1137.9s)]
*  And he was like, oh, we don't accept it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1138.9s)]
*  I think that was a huge mistake. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1140.7s)]
*  I think they could have, you know, and again, this is not to insist or say that I know for [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1142.5s)]
*  a fact that this would have moderated Hamas. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1147.18s)]
*  But I'm saying Hamas participated in those elections which happened under the auspices [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1149.8200000000002s)]
*  of Oslo, right, which was in itself a kind of implicit acceptance of the Oslo principles. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1155.2s)]
*  I think the smart move would have been to kind of take that yes for an answer and continue [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1162.28s)]
*  to pull on it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1167.28s)]
*  We'll never know. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1168.28s)]
*  OK, like you, I don't want to turn this all into a debate about Hamas. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1169.28s)]
*  So when thinking about the situation we're in now, let's imagine Matt Dusk gets elected [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1175.04s)]
*  president by some series of strange constitutional anomalies and you get to use your muscle. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1181.6s)]
*  We have an immediate ceasefire. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  Then what do we do? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1195.84s)]
*  Well, if we have an immediate ceasefire, I mean, there's the question of, you know, reconstruction [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1196.84s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1202.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1203.6799999999998s)]
*  Who's going to run it? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1204.6799999999998s)]
*  Who's going to run it? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1205.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, there are a few options, none of them easy, none of them great. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1206.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis are going to be they are insisting that they need a continuing [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1210.52s)]
*  presence. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1214.48s)]
*  That's a problem, obviously, for the Palestinians. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1215.48s)]
*  There's the possibility of bringing the Palestinian Authority back in. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1218.0s)]
*  Also extremely problematic, not only because the PA is, you know, ineffective and corrupt, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1221.48s)]
*  but why would they want to take this responsibility when they're seen as having come back on the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1227.42s)]
*  back of the back of the Israeli tank, so to speak. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1231.32s)]
*  I think there's the possibility of a kind of international trusteeship. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  My friend Harry Reese, who's at Columbia Law School, wrote an interesting piece for, I [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1238.36s)]
*  think, just the website, Just Security, if I'm not mistaken, or Lawfare, one of those [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1243.04s)]
*  two about this possibility, the history of the idea of trusteeship and the possibility [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1249.0s)]
*  of a multinational force. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1254.3s)]
*  And again, Israel, given the experience with UNIFIL, is not super crazy about that idea. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1256.36s)]
*  But that is a possibility. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  But I do think whatever kind of solution we arrive at, what is going to make it effective [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1262.44s)]
*  at all is showing that the international community, which basically means the US leading the international [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1268.4s)]
*  community, is showing that we are committed to following through on the promise, finally, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1275.94s)]
*  of Palestinian liberation. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1282.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1284.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1285.24s)]
*  That brings me to the next question I wanted to ask you, which is to sort of zoom out from [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1286.24s)]
*  the current crisis and really ask about the ultimate resolution of this grim struggle [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1289.4s)]
*  between Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1295.48s)]
*  And you just alluded to it now when you talked about the prospect of Palestinian liberation. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1297.96s)]
*  So Foreign Affairs just did a symposium on the two-state solution, and they asked people, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  great experts, I was not among them, is the two-state solution now, after October 7th [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1309.52s)]
*  is the two-state solution dead? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1317.88s)]
*  And you were properly, I would say, one of the experts that they consulted. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  And you said focusing on the two-state solution is a distraction. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1323.7600000000002s)]
*  It's a way of avoiding looking at the undemocratic and unequal one-state reality that exists [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1328.0400000000002s)]
*  now. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1335.2800000000002s)]
*  You said, look, it could still be viable, but for it to be viable, the US president [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1336.2800000000002s)]
*  has to decide to uphold international law, support consequences for those who violate [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1340.8000000000002s)]
*  it, et cetera. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1346.32s)]
*  But you said the most important thing is to focus on ending the Israeli occupation and [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1347.32s)]
*  system of violence against Palestinians that it facilitates and help create conditions [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1351.68s)]
*  for Jewish and Palestinian coexistence on the basis of political equality in whatever [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1356.32s)]
*  arrangements they choose. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  So let's talk Turkey, or as they would say in Hebrew, let's talk Tuchles. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1362.3400000000001s)]
*  So what does this look like? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it felt almost utopian to be talking about Israelis and Palestinians after October [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1368.88s)]
*  7th to be coming together to arrive at a new set of arrangements that would recognize [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1375.96s)]
*  their equal rights. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1382.96s)]
*  So a couple of weeks ago, we had Jared Kushner here, and Jared Kushner talked about this [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1383.96s)]
*  map that he drew for Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1390.8400000000001s)]
*  OK, so we give you the pen and we say, draw the map. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1393.64s)]
*  Tell me what the arrangements are. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1397.96s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1399.52s)]
*  I don't feel like we need to draw a new map. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1401.92s)]
*  I mean, there is a map. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1404.44s)]
*  It's a Palestinian state on the 67 lines. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1407.72s)]
*  Is that the end of the story? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1410.5s)]
*  No. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1412.0s)]
*  But I think it's important to understand that is a state that's recognized by a majority [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1413.0s)]
*  of the UN member states in the world. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1417.22s)]
*  More member states actually than recognize the state of Israel. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1420.88s)]
*  How much is that worth? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1423.72s)]
*  I don't know, but it is worth noting. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1424.72s)]
*  But my answer there, and I meant it, I mean, one could say it was a dodge. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1428.28s)]
*  But again, I think the question has become a distraction. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1432.1s)]
*  People say they support a two state solution because they just won't someday. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1435.94s)]
*  This is what we want. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1439.3s)]
*  So let's kind of worry about that instead of worrying about what's happening now is [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1441.1399999999999s)]
*  an easy out. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1445.1399999999999s)]
*  And I thought that was important to note because I think that's the function that plays in [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1447.26s)]
*  Washington foreign policy circles. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1451.86s)]
*  You can see this with the Biden administration. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1453.6799999999998s)]
*  We need to get back to a two state solution. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1455.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm not going to really do anything about what's happening right now. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1457.46s)]
*  But if it's utopian to believe that these two peoples can come to an agreement, I'm [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1462.16s)]
*  guilty as charged because my belief about this, despite what you'll often hear from [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1466.46s)]
*  kind of to be to be your historians is like, well, these are ancient conflicts going back [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1471.96s)]
*  many hundreds and thousands of years. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1476.82s)]
*  And you know, sure, there's a lot of history here. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1479.18s)]
*  There's a lot of religion. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1481.72s)]
*  I don't downplay that. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1483.02s)]
*  But again, this is a modern political conflict between two peoples who have valid claims [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1484.26s)]
*  on this land and it can be solved. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1490.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1492.66s)]
*  With some kind of political partition, partition or are you more open to the idea of one democratic [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1493.66s)]
*  state for two peoples? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1499.58s)]
*  I mean, I think there have been so many tracks laid down around the two state solution that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1500.58s)]
*  it's hard to turn that ship. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1505.3s)]
*  At the same time, the reality on the ground is what it is. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1506.94s)]
*  We've got over 600,000 settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1510.22s)]
*  I think there are some interesting alternative versions of the two state solution, such as [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1515.26s)]
*  the confederal solution being offered by this Israeli Palestinian group called the Land [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1519.26s)]
*  for All, which is attractive to me because it does not require partition. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  It is not premised on the idea that Jews over here, Palestinians over here, it recognizes [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1529.38s)]
*  that this ship, the land is valuable and has resonance and is important for all of these [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1534.22s)]
*  people. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1539.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1540.5s)]
*  You know, as much of an opponent I am to the settlement enterprise, I recognize that the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1541.5s)]
*  land of Judea and Samaria is enormously important to Jews. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1546.14s)]
*  I acknowledge and I respect that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1550.42s)]
*  I'm also not a huge fan of expelling families. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1552.26s)]
*  That is what we are talking about if we are talking about moving 600,000 settlers from [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1556.14s)]
*  the West Bank back into pre-67 Israel. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1560.7s)]
*  Again, not a fan of how they got there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1563.3s)]
*  But the bottom line is these are families and communities that have been there for many [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1565.7s)]
*  years. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  Expulsion is ugly, no matter how you look at it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1571.0600000000002s)]
*  And what I like about the Land for All is that they can remain there. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1574.8200000000002s)]
*  They will vote as citizens of the state of Israel live in the state of Palestine as protected [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1579.5s)]
*  citizens and Palestinian refugees who return from Lebanon or wherever can live in the communities [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1584.66s)]
*  they were expelled from as voting citizens of the state of Palestine. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1590.96s)]
*  Again, not a quick and simple solution, but I think there is a lot to commend it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1596.04s)]
*  Yeah, so that plan involves a kind of right of return for Palestinians to what would be [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1600.56s)]
*  called Israel proper, but they would not hold Israeli citizenship. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1605.96s)]
*  Correct. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1609.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1610.56s)]
*  So that gets around some of the demographic issue. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1611.56s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1614.88s)]
*  Okay, so it doesn't get around though the problem or the concern that these are two [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1616.64s)]
*  peoples who at this point in time have developed so much hatred and suspicion of each other. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1626.92s)]
*  One of the saddest things that, the two saddest scenes that I have observed in the war in [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1634.2s)]
*  The first was seeing some of the Hamas fighters come back to Gaza with hostages and just seeing [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1643.72s)]
*  the average citizens kind of celebrating this and that was really hard to watch. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1651.48s)]
*  Equally hard for me to watch was Israeli citizens putting out deck chairs and watching the explosions [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1657.1599999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1665.32s)]
*  And that spoke to me of two people who I can't imagine. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1666.84s)]
*  Dehumanized each other. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1671.4s)]
*  Right, and so I can't imagine a solution of the kind you're describing where they're still [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1673.0s)]
*  living cheek by jowl with each other at least in our lifetimes. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1680.6000000000001s)]
*  I can't disagree. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1687.0s)]
*  The trauma of these images, these realities, these attacks, this violence, even before [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1689.72s)]
*  October 7, this was going to be difficult. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1695.3200000000002s)]
*  This would be a generational healing process. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1698.72s)]
*  That timeline has been extended considerably by October 7 and by the war in the aftermath [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1702.3999999999999s)]
*  of October 7. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1707.56s)]
*  But what is the option? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1710.0s)]
*  The other thing is just, and again I really want you to be right about this, but you've [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1712.56s)]
*  said that recognizing the Palestinians legitimate right to statehood, which by the way is something [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1716.72s)]
*  I absolutely believe in, is going to basically make Hamas irrelevant. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1722.72s)]
*  It will drain the swamp of the raw materials that lead to support for Hamas. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1729.28s)]
*  And I just wonder, how do you know that? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1736.72s)]
*  That seems like a huge risk to ask an Israeli to take. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1739.0s)]
*  No, it is a huge risk. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1742.72s)]
*  And again, there's going to be serious security measures continuing into the future around [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1744.2s)]
*  that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1749.68s)]
*  And I don't want to be simple-minded about this, but it will take time. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1750.68s)]
*  But ultimately you can look at examples like Ireland or elsewhere. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1755.16s)]
*  You dealt with this because you showed people that there was an alternative and that was [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1760.32s)]
*  producing something for them. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1763.7s)]
*  I think the challenge of the so-called peace process or whatever is that the international [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1766.16s)]
*  community basically made a promise to the Palestinians, end violence, end terrorism, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1771.04s)]
*  commit to nonviolence and a democratic process, and you'll have self-determination. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1776.6399999999999s)]
*  We have shown them that that is not true. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  That has been argument, that has been basically a recruiting program for Hamas. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1783.48s)]
*  They're saying everything they told you, everything Fatah told you about committing to this process [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1788.0s)]
*  has been a lie. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1793.04s)]
*  It wasn't a lie. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1794.04s)]
*  It was true. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1795.44s)]
*  And then every time the Palestinians were offered a deal, they turned it down. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1796.44s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1800.44s)]
*  I think there are deals that could have been followed. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1802.2s)]
*  I think the Palestinians made some bad choices. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1805.28s)]
*  I think it's kind of simplistic to say there was a deal on the table and the Palestinians [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1807.8799999999999s)]
*  just said no. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1812.24s)]
*  I think there were deals on the table that Israel has not responded to. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1813.24s)]
*  The Arab peace initiative in 2002, to this day Israel has not only not rejected, they've [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1816.48s)]
*  not acknowledged it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1821.56s)]
*  They have not responded to it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1823.24s)]
*  But again, I don't want to get into a game of they did, sure, their leadership, leaderships [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1824.8s)]
*  on both sides have made enormous mistakes. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1830.96s)]
*  Again, don't want to make an equivalence here. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1832.76s)]
*  There is no equivalence between the more powerful and the less powerful side, but certainly [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1835.3999999999999s)]
*  acknowledge that their leaders have not served their people as well as they should have. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think there is a way for the United States to work to show that diplomacy and [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1844.9599999999998s)]
*  nonviolence will produce something for you. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1853.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, we've been helping to show the opposite. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1855.12s)]
*  Again, the October 7 attacks are indefensible. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1858.24s)]
*  However, I do understand the logic looking over the past few years. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  When do people pay attention to Gaza? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1866.6s)]
*  When there is violence? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1869.9599999999998s)]
*  And then everyone spends a few days or weeks saying, oh, man, we got to deal with this [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1871.8s)]
*  problem and then we get this, you know, after a month, we're paying attention to something [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1875.08s)]
*  else that created a really, really horrible incentive structure. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1879.6399999999999s)]
*  Again, not to absolve Hamas for its responsibility, which it absolutely has for that decision. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1884.28s)]
*  But the United States did play a role into creating this incentive structure. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1890.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1893.6s)]
*  No, and I think I agree with that. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1894.6s)]
*  How would you respond to somebody who says to you, you're right, but to, you know, make [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1897.8s)]
*  these dramatic moves now towards a Palestinian state would be to reward that kind of behavior [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1906.0s)]
*  from Hamas? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  I would say, first of all, we should have been doing this anyway. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1913.12s)]
*  If October 7 serves as a wake-up call, you know, I understand the argument. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1917.44s)]
*  Why would you want to reward them? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1921.16s)]
*  Listen, if what you're saying, I mean, and again, Hamas's charter does not support a [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1923.12s)]
*  two-state solution. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1927.3799999999999s)]
*  So working toward a two-state solution would not be a reward for Hamas. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1928.8799999999999s)]
*  It would actually get toward something they don't want. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1932.52s)]
*  But I would also, you know, one example, historical example I've given is, you know, look at the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1935.72s)]
*  Dariusine massacre of 1948, which was a massacre carried out by Zionist militias against Palestinian [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1942.28s)]
*  civilians in the village of Dariusine. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1949.6s)]
*  Five weeks later, the state of Israel was declared and recognized by the United States. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1951.48s)]
*  Was that a reward for Dariusine? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1956.06s)]
*  No. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1958.32s)]
*  I mean, that was more of a civil war. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1959.32s)]
*  Look, one thing we've never talked about here, but, you know, this could all end if Hamas [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1962.0s)]
*  the hostages and surrendered. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1968.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1971.4s)]
*  I mean, that's an argument that is made about besieged populations all the time. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1972.4s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't seem to be terribly, I mean, you and I both agree about the nature [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  of this organization, Hamas. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1983.48s)]
*  Don't we want it to be defeated? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1985.2s)]
*  I do. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1988.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, totally. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1989.4s)]
*  I mean, but I also recognize that it is embedded and is going to play a part in Palestinian [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1990.4s)]
*  society as much as I don't like that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1995.36s)]
*  Again, I've made clear my feelings on social conservative religious organizations, especially [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=1997.36s)]
*  violent ones. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2001.76s)]
*  But again, let's be realistic. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2002.76s)]
*  There are certain groups that I wish were not part of Israeli politics. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2005.4399999999998s)]
*  I recognize they have a role in Israeli politics. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2008.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but they're not going into Gaza and, you know, raping and killing and, you [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2011.56s)]
*  know. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, they're going into the West Bank burning and killing and ejecting Palestinians from [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2017.6799999999998s)]
*  their homes. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2020.76s)]
*  I mean, not on the scale. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2021.76s)]
*  Not on the scale. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2023.8s)]
*  OK, so on a longer timeline. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2024.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, let's talk about things that the Biden administration is doing right now to try to [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2026.96s)]
*  solve this problem, one of which is this tripartite deal that we keep hearing about, which would [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2033.12s)]
*  entail the U.S. recognizing the Palestinian authorities of Palestinian state, Saudi Arabia [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2038.72s)]
*  normalizing with Israel and the U.S. in return offering a security guarantee to the Saudis. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2044.6s)]
*  So this very complicated deal that's going to get us the thing that you want, which is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2052.24s)]
*  Palestinian liberation. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2058.12s)]
*  And yet you are not a fan of this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2061.68s)]
*  Well, I don't want Palestinian liberation just for its own sake. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2062.68s)]
*  I want Palestinian liberation because I feel it's consistent with my general approach to [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2065.3199999999997s)]
*  foreign policy, which is to support freedom and liberation and equality for human beings. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2070.0s)]
*  I want that for Palestinians. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2075.8399999999997s)]
*  I want that for Israelis. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2077.3999999999996s)]
*  I want that for Saudis. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2079.06s)]
*  And my concern with the so-called Saudi normalization deal, which I've argued is basically a U.S.-Saudi [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2081.96s)]
*  security deal wrapped in kind of a sweet candy coating of peace and normalization, is not [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2089.76s)]
*  — the reason I've criticized that is not just because it consigns the Palestinians [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2094.92s)]
*  to a future of repression, but because it consigns the people of the region to a future [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2098.64s)]
*  of repression. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2104.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2105.32s)]
*  Because all these — [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2106.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, one of the most important Muslim countries, has normal relations with Israel. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2107.32s)]
*  That could be a future of peace. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2111.76s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2113.2400000000002s)]
*  Listen, if Saudi Arabia wants to have normalization and peace with Israel, they should do it. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2114.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, God bless. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2118.0400000000004s)]
*  Again, normalization is something I support. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2119.6000000000004s)]
*  Israel is there. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2122.0s)]
*  It's not going away. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2123.0s)]
*  It should be normalized and accepted in the region. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2124.0s)]
*  I question why that needs to be underwritten by all these goodies from the American people. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2126.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, a security guarantee from the United States is a very, very serious thing. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2131.44s)]
*  A civilian nuclear program, obviously a very, very serious thing. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2135.96s)]
*  That equation does not add up for me. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2141.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2143.68s)]
*  I mean, look, the Saudis, if they don't get the civilian nuclear program from the United [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2144.68s)]
*  States, they're going to get it from somebody else. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2147.36s)]
*  Why doesn't it make sense for us, the United States of America, to try to bind this huge [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2149.7599999999998s)]
*  energy producer, this very important Muslim country, bind them to the U.S. orbit for generations [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2155.16s)]
*  to come? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2162.2999999999997s)]
*  And on top of that, we can make — we can start making peace between Israel and the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2163.68s)]
*  Arabs. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2169.3199999999997s)]
*  We're not going to bind them to anything. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2171.04s)]
*  I mean, Saudi Arabia, MBS is going to do what he wants, and he's going to haggle and bid [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2172.88s)]
*  up the United States as much as he can. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2177.32s)]
*  And certainly, if they get the nuclear program and the security guarantee, you can be sure [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2179.96s)]
*  that he's going to be coming back in a few years for more. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  That's how this tends to work. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2186.56s)]
*  We've run this play before. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2188.0s)]
*  We ran it during the Cold War when all these client states were constantly coming back [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2189.0s)]
*  for more. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2194.04s)]
*  It's like, well, we've been talking to the Soviets. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2195.04s)]
*  What do you got for us? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2196.7200000000003s)]
*  And this goes to why I think it was such a brilliant stroke by MBS to kind of bring in [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2197.72s)]
*  China to negotiate this Iran detente, because the audience for that signing ceremony was [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2202.56s)]
*  not there. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2208.9599999999996s)]
*  It was in the Oval Office. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2209.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but that's — I mean, the argument you could make is that they were pushed to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2210.9599999999996s)]
*  do that by an American administration that had been talking about them as if they were [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2214.72s)]
*  pariahs. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2219.16s)]
*  What I observe with the Saudis is a lot of unrequited love. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2220.24s)]
*  They want to be with Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam just for whatever reason can't quite stomach [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2223.88s)]
*  them. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2231.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't — to look at the sweep of the U.S.-Saudi relationship and characterize [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2232.92s)]
*  it that way, I'm sorry. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2237.32s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2238.88s)]
*  But let me just say, I mean, listen, Joe Biden said that pariah stuff on the campaign trail, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2240.28s)]
*  but he very quickly shifted upon taking office. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2244.36s)]
*  They came in, they put out the intelligence report on Khashoggi. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2247.96s)]
*  They were like, we really don't like when you cut up journalists. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2251.52s)]
*  And then after that, they basically just — it was all — the groundwork was already being [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2254.4s)]
*  laid for the fist bump. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2259.6s)]
*  They'll tell us, well, it was because Ukraine changed everything. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2261.28s)]
*  No, they were well on the way to that photo op before the Russian invasion. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2264.1600000000003s)]
*  What's the problem with the fist bump? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2267.84s)]
*  Like, I mean, did you want Saudi Arabia to be a pariah forever because of this? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2269.52s)]
*  I think, you know, it has to be said the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible crime. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2275.96s)]
*  But does that mean that now we can't have a relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2282.8s)]
*  We are going to have and should have relationships with all kinds of regimes, some very bad. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2287.96s)]
*  The nature of that relationship, the extent of it, how much we trust them, how much we [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2292.6s)]
*  support them is to be determined. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2296.08s)]
*  What would the Saudis do for Matt Duss to get past — I mean, not put money in your [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2299.08s)]
*  bank account — but to get past the — [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2305.96s)]
*  That Jared was just here all night. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2308.88s)]
*  To get past — [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2312.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2313.84s)]
*  To get past the — come on now, guys — to get past the Khashoggi crime. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2314.84s)]
*  I mean, how do we — how do you get — presumably, you and I both agree that there are some serious [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  national interests here. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2329.8399999999997s)]
*  And we also agree that what happened to the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2331.9599999999996s)]
*  was a great crime. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2337.9199999999996s)]
*  How do we pursue the national interest? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2339.48s)]
*  What would allow Matt Duss to say that enough reparation had been made or that the national [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2343.52s)]
*  interest in Saudi Arabia overrides our — or is this just something you can't get past? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2350.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's something that is going to keep the relationship at a certain level above [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2358.3599999999997s)]
*  which it will not rise. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2362.6s)]
*  I mean, again, let's remember — [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2363.6s)]
*  So to fix it, it would have to be — MBS would have to leave or get put in jail or something. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2365.3599999999997s)]
*  Listen — [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2370.2s)]
*  I mean, the people who committed the murder are in jail. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2371.2s)]
*  Are they? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's what the Saudis say, at least. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2376.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2378.0s)]
*  That's what they say? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2379.0s)]
*  You are wise to be skeptical, but I'm just saying that even their official rhetoric has [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2380.0s)]
*  been to recognize that this was a crime and that people who committed the crime should [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2386.88s)]
*  be punished. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2390.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2391.56s)]
*  I mean, I think there is a period of time at least before you go for a fist bump. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2392.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like four years. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2396.6s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2398.32s)]
*  I mean, this happened the second year. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2399.32s)]
*  I mean — [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2400.6s)]
*  Well, but the murder of Jamal Khashoggi — am I wrong? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2401.6s)]
*  That it was October — [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2403.92s)]
*  Okay, 2018? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2404.92s)]
*  2018, yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2405.92s)]
*  Again, it was less than two years into Biden's administration. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2406.92s)]
*  And there was certainly no — [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2409.64s)]
*  We're less than two years into Biden, so it's four years. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2410.64s)]
*  I mean — [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2414.2s)]
*  But my answer to your question — [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2415.2s)]
*  Is that not a decent interval? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2416.2s)]
*  No. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2417.2s)]
*  I really — and again, it's not — [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2418.2s)]
*  What is a decent interval? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2419.64s)]
*  It's not just Khashoggi. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2420.64s)]
*  It's harassment of Saudi students in the United States. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2421.64s)]
*  It's harassment of activists around the world, certainly their own internal repression. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2424.56s)]
*  There's a bill of complaints. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2431.24s)]
*  And again, this is something the United States has overlooked for a long time. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2432.3199999999997s)]
*  And your question about — listen, again, if there's something we've learned over the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2436.72s)]
*  past 20-plus years, the United States has neither the ability nor the right to reach [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2440.08s)]
*  into other countries and tell them who their leaders are. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2444.48s)]
*  We need to deal with countries as they are. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2446.68s)]
*  There are tools that we have to express our displeasure and our support for certain currents [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2448.7s)]
*  versus others. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2453.6s)]
*  In a situation like Saudi Arabia, obviously it's tough. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2454.6s)]
*  This guy is going to be around for a long, long time. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2457.52s)]
*  But I think there is — again, if we are serious about human rights, if we are serious about [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2461.3399999999997s)]
*  upholding international law, we have to make clear to them and to every country and leader [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2465.12s)]
*  around the world that if you want a strong and deep relationship with the United States, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2469.24s)]
*  there are certain things that are going to make that better and they're going to keep [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2473.2s)]
*  it bad. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2476.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2477.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is a place that I see liberalizing with respect to women. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  It's a place that I see opening up to the world. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2483.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a place where I see personal liberties going from less than zero to maybe not where [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2486.8399999999997s)]
*  we are in the United States or in the West, but certainly an appreciable improvement. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2492.4s)]
*  Why isn't that something that we should be embracing and encouraging and again, trying [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2497.0s)]
*  to bind this country closer to it? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2502.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2504.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, and MBS is certainly not the first revolutionary modernizing autocrat that we've [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2505.1200000000003s)]
*  seen in the world. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2509.1600000000003s)]
*  We've seen how that has gone eventually. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2511.0s)]
*  This often does not work out great. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, we should acknowledge it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2516.2000000000003s)]
*  We should applaud the good steps when they happen. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2518.0s)]
*  And again, part of the concern here is, and again, I don't want to let the perfect be [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2520.48s)]
*  the enemy of the good, even though I'm not crazy about that saying, but this is all continues [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2524.12s)]
*  to be centralized. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2529.2400000000002s)]
*  These reforms are centralized in one person. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2530.48s)]
*  So any agreement that we have with the Saudi government is an agreement with one person [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2533.8s)]
*  and we should always understand that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2538.64s)]
*  And the problem with that is that they're inherently unreliable. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2541.96s)]
*  What's the... [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2545.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2546.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2547.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2548.68s)]
*  You are appropriately, I think, tough and on Saudi Arabia, skeptical of the government [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2549.9199999999996s)]
*  and I'm trying to push you on what would be trust building measures that the Saudis could [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2555.3999999999996s)]
*  undertake and it sounds like you're saying change your entire system of government, which [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2562.04s)]
*  feels unrealistic. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2566.16s)]
*  But there's another country in the region that an uncharitable reader could say that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2568.68s)]
*  you're actually quite soft on comparatively. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2574.96s)]
*  So we've got Saudi Arabia liberalizing autocracy, trying to become more Western, trying to come [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2577.56s)]
*  closer to us. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2584.2s)]
*  And then we've got this other country, Iran, which I think is a great mischief maker in [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2585.2s)]
*  the region, the supporter of regimes like the Assad regime that is the most avid slaughterer [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2591.2s)]
*  of Sunni Muslims, Arab Muslims on the planet. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2600.72s)]
*  And it feels like you have a more open attitude towards Iran. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2606.6000000000004s)]
*  You've talked about an Iran hysteria industry. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2612.36s)]
*  You've said the Saudis and the Israelis, when they say that they are being besieged by Iran, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2616.44s)]
*  they're not recognizing that Iran's defense budget is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of their [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2622.88s)]
*  defense budget. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2628.6800000000003s)]
*  It's almost as if you think that they are overplaying the threat of the mullahs. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2629.8399999999997s)]
*  And I haven't even gotten into the fact the mullahs' domestic behavior, that you criticized [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2636.7999999999997s)]
*  some things that you observe in Saudi Arabia. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2643.44s)]
*  The Iranian regime is guilty of those things times 10. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2648.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if times 10, but I will thank you for calling that uncharitable in terms [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2651.56s)]
*  of my own view. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2657.8799999999997s)]
*  Listen, I've been very critical and will continue to be of Iran's behavior. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2658.88s)]
*  I think there are steps we are taking, sanctions on Iranian individuals, on the Iranian government [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2663.6800000000003s)]
*  for their human rights abuses that are absolutely appropriate. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2668.44s)]
*  Even though I was supportive and continue to support the Iranian nuclear deal, not only [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2672.86s)]
*  because I thought it solved a very serious problem by putting a cap on Iran's nuclear [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2677.96s)]
*  program that was a legitimate concern. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2682.32s)]
*  I wrote a piece at the time for the nation saying, we've got to keep our eye on the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2686.24s)]
*  ball of Iranian human rights. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2691.0s)]
*  This is still a problem, but not only because it's a real problem, but because we cannot [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2692.64s)]
*  be seen as treating human rights as simply a cudgel that was used to get the nuclear [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2697.4399999999996s)]
*  deal. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2701.6s)]
*  We support human rights because human rights need support. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2702.6s)]
*  So again, I think the question Saudi versus Iran, listen, Iran is under more sanctions [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  from the United States, has had faced hostility from the United States for very good reason. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2713.8s)]
*  Again, it takes two to tangle here. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2718.5600000000004s)]
*  Iran certainly has done stuff, is doing stuff in the region and to its own people that are [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2720.92s)]
*  a huge problem. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2725.5600000000004s)]
*  I think pressure on them, criticism is absolutely appropriate. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2726.5600000000004s)]
*  But to compare that to Saudi with whom we've had this longstanding loving relationship, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  and again, I'm not saying the relationship should be the same. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2736.1600000000003s)]
*  We have to make different decisions based on different governments. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2739.2200000000003s)]
*  What I am saying is, listen, Iran is in the region as well. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2742.06s)]
*  I think there is a way to try and talk to them, even if we shouldn't have any illusions [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2745.74s)]
*  about what we're going to achieve. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2750.32s)]
*  And again, one of my real criticisms of Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2752.18s)]
*  and Biden's decision to slow walk returning to it, which I think played a role in the [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2757.66s)]
*  fact that we're going to lose it, was no one should have pretended, I don't think Obama [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2762.06s)]
*  ever pretended that the Iran nuclear agreement was going to put us on a glide path to a better [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2766.7s)]
*  relationship or put Iran on a glide path to reform. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2771.58s)]
*  But what I do know is that dealing with that source of tension created possibilities, having [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2774.48s)]
*  established some measure of trust in a government that is very suspicious, with some good reason [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2780.0s)]
*  of the United States and its intentions to say that, listen, our diplomats got together [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2786.88s)]
*  around a table for a long time and finally hammered out something that both sides could [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2790.96s)]
*  be OK with. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2795.9s)]
*  That created some possibilities that now I think have been lost. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2797.22s)]
*  I mean, there are those who say that the Iranians got the better part of that deal, and the [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2800.52s)]
*  result was that they suddenly got access to resources which not only strengthened the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2804.12s)]
*  regime at home, but also enabled them to lavishly fund their proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2810.2799999999997s)]
*  So, I mean, Matt, you are somebody I feel is deeply committed to the democratization [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2817.7999999999997s)]
*  of this part of the world. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2824.8599999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2826.2799999999997s)]
*  You don't want it to come at the hands of a Bush 43-style policy, but you definitely [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2827.6400000000003s)]
*  want the U.S. to be pushing towards democratization. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2833.88s)]
*  In Iran, we've seen people rise up against that government. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2837.1200000000003s)]
*  Why isn't the right strategy to starve that government of resources? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2840.7200000000003s)]
*  And the JCPOA wasn't doing that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2845.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2846.84s)]
*  Again, show me where that has worked. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2847.34s)]
*  I mean, the logic of starving the government is to say that, well, you'll create such suffering [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2848.6000000000004s)]
*  that the people will rise up and kind of overthrow or pressure again. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2854.0s)]
*  I mean, the people rising up. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2858.8s)]
*  What did we do to help them? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2860.0s)]
*  And how's that going? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2861.0s)]
*  I mean, what would you suggest I'm doing to help them? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2862.0s)]
*  Again, I mean, this whole argument that left, you know, contended pressure. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2863.84s)]
*  I mean, the argument— [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2866.6800000000003s)]
*  Not relaxing the budget constraints of the Iranian government is what I would propose. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2867.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'll say this. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2870.6800000000003s)]
*  Part of what, you know, part of my support for the Iranian nuclear agreement was that [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2872.0s)]
*  a lot of actual Iranian voices inside Iran were saying—they're not saying this anymore. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2879.2400000000002s)]
*  And I acknowledge that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2884.04s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2884.76s)]
*  But at the time, they were saying, listen, we hate this government. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2885.4s)]
*  But if you can deal with this source of pressure, diminish tension between our two governments, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2889.12s)]
*  this could open civil space for us to do more work. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2893.76s)]
*  I took that very seriously. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2896.76s)]
*  I also take it seriously now that you don't hear— [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2898.08s)]
*  You ever fought a rug in the Middle East? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2899.92s)]
*  Come on. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2902.84s)]
*  But no, you're right. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2904.36s)]
*  Democracy is something I take very seriously here in the United States and not just in [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2905.1600000000003s)]
*  the Middle East, but around the world. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2908.7200000000003s)]
*  And it is under real threat. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2910.0s)]
*  But I think there are tools the United States can and should use, certainly short of invasion [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2911.16s)]
*  and occupation, to advance that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2915.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2918.6s)]
*  So I want to open this up to my students. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2919.1s)]
*  But I want to ask one last question. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2923.08s)]
*  So how does a guy named Matt Duss get so deeply involved in the Middle East? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2924.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, if I'm going to start, a big part of it is that I grew up in the evangelical [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2931.68s)]
*  Christian community. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2938.3199999999997s)]
*  And so my initial engagement with the Middle East happened through the Bible, the Old [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  and New Testament. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2943.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think as I got older, you know, I can point to different other events, but I was [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2945.84s)]
*  just—in our home, there was a lot of, you know, kind of international consciousness. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2949.6400000000003s)]
*  My dad is a refugee from Ukraine. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2953.6400000000003s)]
*  So certainly during the Cold War, we were— [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  I mentioned everything that was going on. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2959.7400000000002s)]
*  So I was raised with a sense of, you know, there are things beyond our borders that really [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2962.56s)]
*  matter and we should pay attention. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2966.36s)]
*  I also had a very close friend in high school, actually a singer in my band, who is Iraqi-American. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2967.64s)]
*  And I was very close with his family. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2973.96s)]
*  So that was kind of my path. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2977.92s)]
*  And I took a kind of very circuitous path to—I did a small tour of colleges over 12 [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2979.62s)]
*  years for my undergrad. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2986.4s)]
*  But once I kind of realized that I wanted to focus on U.S. policy in the Middle East [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2987.5s)]
*  as a kind of a profession, I went through graduate school fairly quickly with Ellis supporting me. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2992.64s)]
*  That's great. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2998.64s)]
*  That's great. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=2999.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3000.64s)]
*  I will not be able to leave here alive unless I let people ask you questions. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3001.64s)]
*  So I'm going to call on some of my students who have written questions in advance and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3005.3199999999997s)]
*  then we'll open it up. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3009.7999999999997s)]
*  We'll have time to take questions from the audience. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3011.12s)]
*  So the first question I have is from Nitsan Mahlis. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3013.52s)]
*  Where is she? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3016.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3017.52s)]
*  So do you want me to ask it for you? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3018.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3020.6s)]
*  The people I'm going to call on are Nitsan, Sonia, and Nick Maines. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3021.6s)]
*  So get your question ready. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3024.84s)]
*  So Nitsan asked this great question. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3026.68s)]
*  I'm going to try to do my best imitation of you. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3028.92s)]
*  That she says, look, you've argued in the past that American foreign policy has been [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3032.52s)]
*  too tolerant of Israel's policies and has only ever offered, quote, carrots, never sticks. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3035.94s)]
*  However, as Israel has become increasingly ostracized from the international arena—in [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3043.48s)]
*  other words, a lot more sticks—its policies towards Palestinians, Nitsan is saying, have [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3048.84s)]
*  only become more extreme. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3054.36s)]
*  So would more sticks and more sanctions from the U.S. not further fuel isolationism and [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3056.64s)]
*  extremist actors instead of encouraging liberal developments? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3062.68s)]
*  How exactly would making Israel a pariah state, Nitsan is asking, lead to better treatment [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3067.28s)]
*  of Palestinians? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3074.04s)]
*  Thank you for the question. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3075.04s)]
*  I don't support making Israel a pariah state, but I also disagree that Israel has become [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3076.96s)]
*  more isolated. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3080.84s)]
*  I think Israel—and I do give Netanyahu, although I rarely give Netanyahu credit for [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3081.84s)]
*  anything—he has pursued a set of really successful diplomatic initiatives with India, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3085.84s)]
*  with Hungary, with a number of other EU states. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3092.8s)]
*  I could name some others, but again, the relationship with Bolsonaro is Brazil, although that's [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3096.2400000000002s)]
*  on ice now until Bolsonaro comes back, which I hope he doesn't. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3101.08s)]
*  So again, I would kind of disagree with the premise of the question that Israel has become [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3104.96s)]
*  more internationally isolated. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3108.16s)]
*  I think it's building trade relationships. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3109.56s)]
*  It's selling, certainly selling spyware to a lot of people. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3111.6800000000003s)]
*  It is selling just regular software and tech to a lot of people. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3114.96s)]
*  When I talk about being less tolerant and carrots as well as sticks, as I wrote in the [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3121.48s)]
*  piece that that quotes from, as the U.S. approaches the peace process, if we're going to again [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3127.6s)]
*  use that term, I think it does need to take a consistent approach. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3132.68s)]
*  If we are going to sanction bad actors amongst the Palestinians, we need to do the same on [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3136.8799999999997s)]
*  the Israeli side, because there are certainly enough examples, not only violent settlers [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3142.0s)]
*  but people in government who advance settlement policies. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3146.52s)]
*  We're seeing some move toward this by the Biden administration, finally, with this executive [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3149.44s)]
*  order that came out a few weeks ago that named a few violent settlers but also created a [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3153.56s)]
*  whole set of tools for sanctioning settler leaders. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3159.84s)]
*  So that's what I mean. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3163.6800000000003s)]
*  And I do, I really, part of the question I really do acknowledge is I recognize that [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3165.0s)]
*  there is a sense among Israelis of the world's against us. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3170.1600000000003s)]
*  And I take that seriously. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3174.4s)]
*  There are, I think that is legitimate. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3175.76s)]
*  And if we want to do an effective policy, if we want to resolve this, there needs to [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3178.28s)]
*  be a part of this that is like, we are not punishing you. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3183.88s)]
*  We want a secure and durable resolution that recognizes your rights, that recognizes your [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3186.2799999999997s)]
*  history, that recognizes the fact that even if we are not going to settle the question [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3191.8399999999997s)]
*  of who is indigenous and who is not, you are indigenous now. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3196.52s)]
*  You are not going anywhere. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3200.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think that acknowledging that pretty straightforwardly is very key. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3202.3199999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3208.7599999999998s)]
*  The next question I have is from Sonia. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3209.6s)]
*  If Sonia is not here, I'll do my imitation of Sonia. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3211.2s)]
*  Sonia Fosar? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3214.12s)]
*  No? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3215.32s)]
*  Sonia. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3216.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3217.32s)]
*  She has a great question. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3218.32s)]
*  Let me do my imitation of Sonia. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3219.32s)]
*  So she has a much deeper voice than me. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3220.88s)]
*  No. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3223.0400000000004s)]
*  She says her question is about the day after. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3224.0400000000004s)]
*  You've said that Washington should support a democratic process to elect Palestinian [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3226.84s)]
*  leadership that the U.S. would recognize. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3231.88s)]
*  And you also mentioned that the U.S. has neither the right nor the ability to decide who leads [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3234.96s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3240.28s)]
*  What if, through such a process, Hamas or another extremist group is democratically [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3242.24s)]
*  elected into power? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3247.56s)]
*  How should the U.S. and the global community respond? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3249.4799999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3252.12s)]
*  I mean, I think that gets to a really key question of if we are going to get to a point [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3253.12s)]
*  where we can resolve this, we need to have a Palestinian leadership with the legitimacy [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3257.24s)]
*  and the support of the Palestinian national movement, not just within Palestine but around [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3264.52s)]
*  the world to make those commitments in that agreement. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3269.64s)]
*  We do not have that right now. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3273.56s)]
*  So a democratic process to help generate and reconstitute the Palestinian national movement [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3275.6s)]
*  is really important. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3280.6s)]
*  Now, your question is a good one. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3281.6s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3283.56s)]
*  Sonia's question. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3284.56s)]
*  Thank you, Sonia. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3285.56s)]
*  Part of the way we're going to know it's legitimate is because a lot of Americans and a lot of [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3289.76s)]
*  Israelis are not going to like them. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3294.2000000000003s)]
*  There are certain people we could name. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3297.04s)]
*  Again, the name Marwan Barghouti is often thrown out. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3298.92s)]
*  It seems like every few years we have a conversation about Marwan Barghouti. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3302.32s)]
*  But again, he's someone who is pretty politically popular. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3305.88s)]
*  He's someone who is certainly implicated in terrorist attacks. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3308.52s)]
*  But again, as a political leader, he is someone who has credibility with a lot of the factions [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3312.2s)]
*  and a lot of Palestinians in general. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3316.8s)]
*  But again, there are going to be people on the Israeli side who we don't like. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3319.0s)]
*  There are right now. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3324.52s)]
*  There are going to be people like that on the Palestinian side. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3325.8s)]
*  But the key question is... [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3329.0s)]
*  Do you think it would just be a non-starter? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3330.5600000000004s)]
*  Let's say you have an election and Hamas wins. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3332.32s)]
*  That's a non-starter. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3335.52s)]
*  It could be, but let's remember. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3337.04s)]
*  The Palestinians or the Israelis were led by two prime ministers who were former terrorists, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3338.8s)]
*  Itzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3343.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, granted, there were several decades between their terrorism and the fact that they got [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3345.84s)]
*  into government, but this is not unheard of. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3350.48s)]
*  This would not be the first conflict in which terrorist leaders became statesmen. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3353.32s)]
*  I know, but I think that the specific nature of the crimes of these terrorist groups is [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3357.48s)]
*  different. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3362.7200000000003s)]
*  I understand, but this goes back to what I said about the kind of the time it's going [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3363.7200000000003s)]
*  to take to deal with this trauma. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3367.84s)]
*  I think there have been some solutions offered how to deal with this. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3369.6000000000004s)]
*  My friend, Howard El-Gindy, wrote a very good piece for Foreign Affairs that he talked and [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3373.28s)]
*  offered in some detail some solutions about the creation of technocratic governance or [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3377.6000000000004s)]
*  at least leadership in which Hamas is represented, if not actually a part. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3383.12s)]
*  So again, I think there are ways around this. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3391.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3394.16s)]
*  Last question from the students and then we'll open it up to everybody is from Nick Maines. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3395.16s)]
*  Hi, doing. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3399.04s)]
*  Thank you for coming. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3400.04s)]
*  I'm just going to read it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3401.04s)]
*  From your perspective, how have recent shifts in global power dynamics, including the rise [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3402.04s)]
*  of China and Russia's assertive foreign policy, impacted the Middle East's strategic landscape? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3405.96s)]
*  And then I have a second part. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3410.4s)]
*  What implications do these shifts have for U.S. policy in the region, especially in terms [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3412.2999999999997s)]
*  of alliance building and dressing complex? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3415.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3418.14s)]
*  Thanks for the question. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3419.14s)]
*  You know, we can see the impact of Russia. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3420.14s)]
*  I mean, Syria is a great example. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3422.8599999999997s)]
*  Russia has a strong, they played a horrible role in the Syrians of war. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3427.06s)]
*  They still have a strong relationship with Assad. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3430.18s)]
*  I think China is in some ways, I won't say the more interesting one, but again, China [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3434.1s)]
*  has been hard at work building relationships across the world through the Belt and Road, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3440.06s)]
*  but not only, I mean, doing infrastructure projects, having a pretty multifaceted diplomatic [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3443.42s)]
*  and outreach in that way. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3448.82s)]
*  And clearly that's the key question that's on the mind of the Biden administration. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3450.94s)]
*  Again, if it's not obvious, you know, China is the lens through which this administration [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3454.34s)]
*  sees everything. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3459.2599999999998s)]
*  Strategic competition with China, as I think I alluded to before, is the kind of that's [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3460.7s)]
*  the kind of undergirding principle behind the Saudi agreement. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3465.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3470.0s)]
*  Because this U.S. Saudi agreement is necessary to box China out of the region. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3471.1200000000003s)]
*  But in order to sell the U.S. Saudi agreement, you need to wrap it in Saudi Israel peace [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3477.96s)]
*  in order to bring enough Democrats on board. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3482.7200000000003s)]
*  But again, the focus here is China. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3484.76s)]
*  And I'm not saying that China is not a problem. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3487.6000000000004s)]
*  It's not a concern. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3489.6000000000004s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3490.6000000000004s)]
*  But again, I don't think U.S. hegemony and U.S. dominance is valuable in and of itself. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3492.2799999999997s)]
*  My question is, what is it for? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3499.2799999999997s)]
*  And again, I don't support U.S. hegemony, period. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  I want us to be strong. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3503.2s)]
*  I want us to have good relationships. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3504.44s)]
*  I want us to help support, you know, a genuinely rules-based order in the world. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3505.96s)]
*  My own view of rules-based order is, you know, when Gandhi was asked about, you know, Western [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3511.88s)]
*  civilization, he said, I think it would be a great idea. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3516.12s)]
*  That's my idea about a rules-based order. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3519.2s)]
*  Let's have one. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3521.36s)]
*  I don't think that requires, you know, continued American global military hegemony. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3522.36s)]
*  And I do think that seems to me what the general proposition of strategic competition with [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3526.52s)]
*  China is meant to sustain. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3532.1200000000003s)]
*  So I guess getting back to your question. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3534.1200000000003s)]
*  Because you don't think the Chinese want that. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3536.52s)]
*  They don't want Chinese military, global military hegemony. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3538.36s)]
*  I think they want a form of hegemony. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3543.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's just say this. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3545.04s)]
*  I think the Chinese government's vision of China's role in the world and America's vision [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3546.04s)]
*  of role in the world and the values and principles on which each is based are in real tension. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3550.32s)]
*  So I think there's work that definitely needs to be done to come to some kind of understanding. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3556.56s)]
*  Because, again, China is not going anywhere. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3561.1200000000003s)]
*  China has a huge economy. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3562.8s)]
*  It's going to play a powerful and influential role on the world stage. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3564.84s)]
*  And I think our focus right now should be to invest in a set of rules that can guide [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3569.2400000000002s)]
*  when necessary, constrain that role in the same way that it should constrain the United States role. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3575.32s)]
*  Because we've certainly broken and are continuing to break those rules whenever we want. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3581.32s)]
*  And China would love that deal. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3585.76s)]
*  And I think as China continues to rise, as some of these others continue to rise, our [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3588.1600000000003s)]
*  real security interest and frankly just our values would argue for investing more heavily [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3591.96s)]
*  in a system of rules that are actually enforced and upheld. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3599.08s)]
*  Not just because that'd be a nice thing to have. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3602.1200000000003s)]
*  I think there is a genuine security and prosperity interest in doing this. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3604.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3609.16s)]
*  OK. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3609.68s)]
*  So I want to open this up to questions from the audience. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3610.2799999999997s)]
*  So just put up your hand. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3613.9199999999996s)]
*  I will call on you. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3615.04s)]
*  Try to not try. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3616.4799999999996s)]
*  Make your question brief, succinct, potent. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3618.3199999999997s)]
*  Make sure it ends in a question mark. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3621.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm going to start with Adam Satterfield. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3623.04s)]
*  Regarding what happens after the conflict is over, God willing, when it ends, Hamas's [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3624.76s)]
*  role in the government, considering it's a democratically elected government, should [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  they be allowed to remain in power? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3642.6800000000003s)]
*  Is there any way for Hamas to have influence in the government? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3644.92s)]
*  And if not, who gets to decide who will govern the Palestinian people? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3649.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3654.36s)]
*  Again, there's the short term, which we talked about the idea of different ideas of trusteeship [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3655.36s)]
*  or multinational force. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3660.0s)]
*  I think once we're getting into the Palestinians governing themselves, again, I think we have [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3661.56s)]
*  to be ready for Hamas to continue to exist. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3666.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think they should be in government. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3670.6800000000003s)]
*  I think there's a way to have a government. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3672.6400000000003s)]
*  And again, this goes back to the piece I mentioned from Khalid al-Gindhi, where you have a government [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3675.0s)]
*  that Hamas is OK with. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3680.76s)]
*  And that's going to be unacceptable to some people by itself. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3683.6s)]
*  But again, if we acknowledge that Hamas is going to continue to play a political role [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3686.8399999999997s)]
*  in Palestine, as I think we have to, it's going to have some say over that government. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3692.12s)]
*  I mean, that's very hard for, I think, an Israeli to swallow after October's conflict. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3699.24s)]
*  I totally understand that. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3704.3199999999997s)]
*  That's legitimate. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3705.3199999999997s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3706.3199999999997s)]
*  I have a question here, and then we have one right over there. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3707.3199999999997s)]
*  Adel Hamas, your research fellow here at the Middle East, and I should thank you for being [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3709.8399999999997s)]
*  with us. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3717.12s)]
*  We'd be remiss not to mention Bernie Sanders, since you are former advisor to the gentleman [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3718.12s)]
*  who's currently back in the UK, I believe. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3724.7599999999998s)]
*  It took a little bit of time for Bernie Sanders to switch his earlier sort of stance on the [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3728.3199999999997s)]
*  Gaza War. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3735.08s)]
*  So at what point did he cross the Rubicon and go back to what many in the Democrat sort [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3736.68s)]
*  of left wing would have thought he would have sort of reverted in the beginning? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3742.12s)]
*  And if you could speak to Michigan and more generally the role of the elections and where [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3746.64s)]
*  Democrats fit into that, Biden, Corvettis. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3751.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, Bernie, you know, obviously can speak well for himself and he does on [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3754.3599999999997s)]
*  this issue a lot. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3760.2s)]
*  I think, like many, he was shocked. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3762.52s)]
*  He was horrified by October 7. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3765.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is, you know, he has spoken out in support of Palestinian rights and resolving [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3767.7200000000003s)]
*  the conflict, ending the occupation. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3772.6800000000003s)]
*  The letter I mentioned for May 2018 is a great example of that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3774.88s)]
*  He is someone who has been paying attention to this issue in a way that few have. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3778.08s)]
*  But still, I think the shocking events of October 7 really, you know, caused him to [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3783.1600000000003s)]
*  step back and say, what is the right approach here? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3788.84s)]
*  And I think he's explained himself numerous times. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3792.88s)]
*  I mean, he is someone who believes that he who has not been calling for a permanent ceasefire, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3795.72s)]
*  as many wanted him to. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3800.92s)]
*  I recognize that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3801.92s)]
*  My own view was immediately calling for a permanent ceasefire on October 8 was not the [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3803.3199999999997s)]
*  right step. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  CIP and we and I called for that some weeks later. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3810.2799999999997s)]
*  But I think the gravity of what we all witnessed, the horror, required a moment, at least. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3814.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, even though he has not said the word ceasefire in or has not said it in the language [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3822.6s)]
*  that I think some of our colleagues on the left have wanted, if you look at what he has [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3828.16s)]
*  been saying in speeches, in statements, he has been very early called for stop the bombing. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3833.04s)]
*  He has been supportive of the temporary ceasefires, the humanitarian pauses. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3838.7999999999997s)]
*  He was one of the key people who pushed the Biden administration on that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3843.68s)]
*  Again, I understand and respect that that was not sufficient for some. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3846.72s)]
*  But I think he has been heavily engaged on this issue. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3851.12s)]
*  I know for a fact that he has been talking to many Palestinian analysts, leaders, Israeli [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3856.04s)]
*  analysts and leaders to try and understand the best way forward that make sure that this [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3860.72s)]
*  never happens again. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3865.68s)]
*  And as I was saying, he understands clearly that the way to make sure this never happens [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3866.68s)]
*  again is to end the occupation. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3870.64s)]
*  So again, I respect the differences of opinion and even some of the criticisms, even though [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3873.88s)]
*  I don't agree with them, that people have leveled at Bernie, I can just say I know that [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3878.7599999999998s)]
*  on this issue, as on every issue, he has he's approached it with enormous humanity and enormous [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3883.2799999999997s)]
*  care. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3888.9599999999996s)]
*  That's something I say without without any doubt. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3890.3599999999997s)]
*  Now about Michigan, I think there's no question that one hundred thousand uncommitted votes [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3893.3199999999997s)]
*  sends a message. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3897.3199999999997s)]
*  This was a campaign that was set up fairly quickly and managed to produce, I think, a [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3898.72s)]
*  really important outcome. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3903.4399999999996s)]
*  I and others have been kind of sounding the alarm on this for a while. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3905.2799999999997s)]
*  And the point that I have made in various places is and I've been saying this to the [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3910.8399999999997s)]
*  Biden team since since very early on is that they need to understand that for a lot of [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3917.7999999999997s)]
*  young Democrats, a lot of young progressives, that the issue of Israel-Palestine is not [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3921.72s)]
*  just a foreign policy issue. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3925.64s)]
*  It is an issue of social and racial justice. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3927.04s)]
*  It is part of the kind of broader intersectional progressive agenda. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3929.72s)]
*  And that it is going to resonate on top of the fact that this catastrophic war has it's [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3936.16s)]
*  very difficult. I don't need to tell you this, I'm sure. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3941.8399999999997s)]
*  But I know that for a lot of my friends and colleagues, just the idea of voting for a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3944.3199999999997s)]
*  president who is supporting this is very difficult. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3948.3199999999997s)]
*  And again, no one needs to explain the stakes of another Trump presidency to Arab Americans. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3950.8799999999997s)]
*  If there's any community that understands what that means, it is my Arab American brothers [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3955.44s)]
*  and sisters at the same time to see a president of their party who claims to uphold human [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3959.48s)]
*  rights, who claims to who want equality and who proclaims the message of social justice [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3965.04s)]
*  to continue to support this is very, very difficult. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3971.12s)]
*  So I hope and I expect and I do see some signs that the Biden team is taking this seriously, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3973.52s)]
*  because certainly there are other efforts in other primary states because again, the [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3980.24s)]
*  100,000 votes and it's not just the votes. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3985.56s)]
*  And this is, I think, a really important point. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3987.9199999999996s)]
*  It's not just that a lot of these people, I mean, certainly I don't think they would [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3989.56s)]
*  vote for Trump. They may not vote. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3993.16s)]
*  But I think the key thing here is that they will not get out the vote, right? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3995.72s)]
*  They will not do the phone banking. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=3999.4799999999996s)]
*  They will not do the door knocking. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4001.08s)]
*  They will not do the canvassing that is necessary to maximize turnout. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4002.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think that is something that can turn them. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4005.7999999999997s)]
*  And that is why they should take this very seriously. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4008.12s)]
*  So, Matt, you're not saying that it's just Arab Americans. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4010.7599999999998s)]
*  You're saying that it's actually young people. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4014.48s)]
*  Yes. But if it's young people, you know, so so 100,000 uncommitted, what what is that as [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4016.8399999999997s)]
*  a percentage of the votes? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4022.52s)]
*  And was it like a little bit under 20 percent? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4024.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's is it around 13? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4027.04s)]
*  I'm not sure the exactual. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4028.6s)]
*  So, you know, you would have expected it to be a lot higher if it were, as you're saying, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4029.88s)]
*  this groundswell of young people who are deeply frustrated by a violation of their core [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4034.8399999999997s)]
*  value. No, I think we've seen the groundswell on the streets. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4040.56s)]
*  I mean, let's acknowledge the the protests we've been seeing for months are intense and [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4042.96s)]
*  they are large. And I would just say again, 100,000 votes is not earth shattering. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4049.6s)]
*  I do think it's a big deal, but it is yet another data point. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4053.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And obviously doesn't take that much to swing an election in Michigan. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4057.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. You know, before we go to the question over here, I just wanted to make a [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4061.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, one thing that I really you just mentioned now that early on you did not call [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4065.2799999999997s)]
*  for an immediate ceasefire in part because of the enormity of what had happened. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4071.2799999999997s)]
*  You had an interview. I can't remember where this was, but you said something I appreciated [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4076.8799999999997s)]
*  enormously when somebody asked you about, you know, progressives who expressed exhilaration [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4081.8399999999997s)]
*  and approval of what happened on October 7th. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4089.56s)]
*  You said, I wish they would not call themselves progressives anymore, which I thought was [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4092.3599999999997s)]
*  a very important and powerful statement. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4095.72s)]
*  But why is it the case that so many progressives, I think, are not really willing to [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4098.36s)]
*  confront the full scale of what Hamas did? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4105.04s)]
*  One frustration that I always also have is that with many people, you know, living in [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4108.08s)]
*  the Arab world, whether that's in the Palestinian territories or elsewhere, you know, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4115.84s)]
*  there's a kind of refusal to grapple with what happened. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4119.88s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4123.76s)]
*  It's just it is hard to confront and criticize your own community. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4125.56s)]
*  I think for a lot of progressives and I am one, I'm on the left. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4129.2s)]
*  But again, I think I want to build a responsible and effective left just from a pragmatic [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4134.72s)]
*  standpoint. I mean, also, it's a moral issue for me when I have zero sympathy, I will not [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4141.04s)]
*  defend what happened October 7th. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4145.68s)]
*  There is no theory of self-defense, anti-colonialism, whatever term you want to use that [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4148.16s)]
*  justified what happened. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4153.16s)]
*  And I reject that. And I mean that anyone who wants to defend that, please do not call [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4155.12s)]
*  yourself a progressive. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4158.56s)]
*  But again, from just a pragmatic standpoint, I want a left that can really fight and get [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4162.6s)]
*  political power. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4167.4800000000005s)]
*  And so even putting aside the moral and ethical piece of it, I know that having those people [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4169.200000000001s)]
*  on the left hurts us. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4173.84s)]
*  OK, we have a question over here. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4176.200000000001s)]
*  Hello. So from your political and progressive perspective, how should United States deal [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4179.96s)]
*  with authoritarianism considering you have said that your rejection to military interventions [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4187.12s)]
*  and also economic sanctions and I will add that also just diplomatic pressure and individual [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4193.400000000001s)]
*  sanctions haven't also have a better achieve any democratic transition. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4198.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think again, not just our brothers from Venezuela. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4203.04s)]
*  Yes. OK, very good. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4208.28s)]
*  Well, good, good question. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4209.88s)]
*  I mean, I think dealing with dealing with, you know, again, it depends on which authoritarian [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4211.4s)]
*  government we're talking about. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4218.64s)]
*  But in general, I think dealing with kleptocracy, corruption and again, this is a core part [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4220.12s)]
*  of what I would call a kind of the progressive theory of the case around foreign policy. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4225.52s)]
*  This is something I did a lot of work with Senator Sanders on. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4231.24s)]
*  If you go, he spoke at our conference. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4233.599999999999s)]
*  I'll just give a big up to the conference we had at CIP in Washington. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4235.799999999999s)]
*  He gave a great speech where he talked about this a lot about, you know, and this is I do [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4239.36s)]
*  appreciate this is something that the Biden administration has taken on board as a key [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4244.599999999999s)]
*  component of their national security strategy is anti-corruption. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4248.2s)]
*  It's dealing with money laundering, not only abroad. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4252.2s)]
*  And this is where I think we're coming up a little bit short is recognizing that the United [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4255.44s)]
*  States still remains the biggest laundromat for kleptocratic money. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4258.96s)]
*  Who knew that Nevada and South Dakota would be kind of the preferred destination for so [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4262.84s)]
*  many of these kleptocrats? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4268.56s)]
*  But that's something we have to take on. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4271.2s)]
*  That's something the United States and the UK have to take on, because, again, New York [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4272.92s)]
*  real estate, not going to mention any names and and UK. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4277.0s)]
*  Sorry, Tarek, I know that was really out of line. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4281.16s)]
*  You know, these these these are these are part of the problem and confronting these [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4283.799999999999s)]
*  interests here in the United States is really key. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4289.5599999999995s)]
*  It's part of a multifaceted approach. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4293.36s)]
*  But you're right. If we kind of leaving aside the military solution as as one of last [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4295.0s)]
*  resort, which I think we should, there are still a whole set of tools. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4300.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't oppose sanctions period. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4303.919999999999s)]
*  I think we have to understand that the point of a sanction is to remove the sanction when [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4307.0s)]
*  it achieves the goal, achieves the change in behavior for which it was intended. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4312.08s)]
*  Again, this is why I think, you know, the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal was important [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4317.64s)]
*  because we imposed a set of sanctions. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4322.12s)]
*  We told the Iranian government we and our allies are going to impose these sanctions [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4324.16s)]
*  because you are doing these things. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4327.88s)]
*  And if you stop doing these things, these sanctions will be lifted. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4329.48s)]
*  That's how they're supposed to work. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4332.48s)]
*  And the problem with how sanctions work now is, a, they kind of just get piled on [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4333.64s)]
*  because it's an easy way for a member of Congress to say, I don't like this thing and [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4338.68s)]
*  I'm doing something about it. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4342.4400000000005s)]
*  But then it's also a way to kind of create political costs for your political opponents [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4344.280000000001s)]
*  for shifting policy. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4349.240000000001s)]
*  You know, we saw this with, you know, the Trump administration right before they left [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4351.04s)]
*  office, they piled on a bunch of new sanctions on Iran. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4354.200000000001s)]
*  Why those sanctions weren't going to achieve anything. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4357.6s)]
*  But what they were going to do is potentially create a bad news day for President Biden [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4359.76s)]
*  when he came in and tried to lift them in an effort to rejoin the deal, which, you know, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4363.96s)]
*  unfortunately, he wasn't able to do. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4368.16s)]
*  And I'm not sure if I answered your question, but thank you. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4370.24s)]
*  OK, so I mean, I think the question was, you know, how should we deal with authoritarian [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4374.76s)]
*  means? You can have my water. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4379.92s)]
*  It's your water. And your answer to that is basically pressure. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4382.0s)]
*  You know, let's let's hit them in the pocketbook. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4387.16s)]
*  I'm on. Yeah. Yeah. OK, that's that's good. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4389.68s)]
*  Amina. Hi, thanks for being here. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4392.12s)]
*  My name is Amina. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4396.32s)]
*  I'm a student from Morocco. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4397.24s)]
*  My question is, one of the many contested issues is the use of the word genocide. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4399.679999999999s)]
*  I'm curious, one, if you think it's an appropriate word to use to describe what's [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4410.76s)]
*  happening right now in Gaza and two, whether or not it is, do you think it's a [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4416.08s)]
*  constructive word to use to describe what's going on in Gaza? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4421.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll answer. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4426.36s)]
*  Well. I'll say it's not a word I've used, but I will say that the International [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4428.44s)]
*  Court of Justice decision made clear that it did not dismiss that it said, in fact, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4435.92s)]
*  there was evidence enough for them to say, make sure this is not happening. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4441.76s)]
*  And while that was not a judgment that said it is happening, I think that is [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4446.24s)]
*  troubling enough. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4449.719999999999s)]
*  You know, there are people I respect, legal scholars, including Israeli [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4451.56s)]
*  scholars, I respect, who have said this is clearly genocide. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4454.76s)]
*  I think what is happening is bad enough. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4458.68s)]
*  Clearly, atrocities are being committed, clearly violations of international [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4460.96s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4465.64s)]
*  But one of the concerns I have with the word genocide is when that word is used, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4467.76s)]
*  the debate becomes about the word genocide. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4472.08s)]
*  And I want people to focus on what is happening, not on the word. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4474.72s)]
*  Next question I have is from David. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4478.8s)]
*  There was an interesting poll of Israeli public opinion put up by a reputable [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4481.04s)]
*  group at Tel Aviv University from mid-January. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4485.08s)]
*  But what really struck me is that it found that 87 percent of Israeli Jews [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4487.72s)]
*  said that the number of casualties in Gaza was either completely or relatively [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4492.96s)]
*  justified to achieve Israel's war aims. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4498.96s)]
*  And they disagreed on what the war aims were. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4501.4400000000005s)]
*  And you mentioned the two different war aims. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4503.16s)]
*  And it was six percent of the number of casualties in Gaza. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4504.64s)]
*  And you mentioned the two different war aims. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4507.4s)]
*  And it was 60 some percent that completely justified. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4508.12s)]
*  You can interpret this different ways. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4511.799999999999s)]
*  Right. It might be Israeli circling the wagon showing how unified they are on [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4512.839999999999s)]
*  this. It might be they don't know. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4516.04s)]
*  Right. They might be in an information bubble as much as other people. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4517.36s)]
*  But let's take it as an actual representation of how Israelis feel about this. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4519.96s)]
*  You've espoused two core normative principles here, right, which is [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4523.759999999999s)]
*  democratic governance in the region and a rules based order. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4528.44s)]
*  These seem to be coming into conflict at this at this moment. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4533.639999999999s)]
*  And so I wanted to get your sense of Israeli public opinion. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4536.599999999999s)]
*  You talked a lot about Netanyahu and right wing groups. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4539.5599999999995s)]
*  It is overwhelmingly supportive. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4541.959999999999s)]
*  And the poll says that they want to see more use of force in Gaza to achieve their [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4544.44s)]
*  war aims. And so I wanted to see when those two things come in conflict. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4548.839999999999s)]
*  Where you see. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4551.639999999999s)]
*  We have to take Israeli public opinion to account. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4554.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, again, we can flip side of the Palestinian question that we're asking. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4556.759999999999s)]
*  Quite right. Recognize that the Israeli public for very understandable and [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4561.0s)]
*  legitimate reasons are outraged and support whatever it takes. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4569.32s)]
*  And we saw a similar opinion after it were at the height of the second Intifada [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4572.28s)]
*  where it was our buses are blowing up. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4577.48s)]
*  I can't put my kid on a bus. I'm terrified. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4579.48s)]
*  Do whatever you have to do. I don't care to bring back security. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4581.44s)]
*  And that is very understandable. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4585.16s)]
*  We see it on the Palestinian side, as ugly as it might be, support for terrorist [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4587.64s)]
*  attacks. Let's understand what drives that. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4591.44s)]
*  That doesn't make it legitimate or not legitimate. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4595.12s)]
*  It is a reality. But again, if we are going to be serious about international law, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4597.92s)]
*  I don't care if 90 percent of Palestinians support the October 7th attacks. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4602.2s)]
*  It's an atrocity. Support for those attacks is something we have to confront [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4606.36s)]
*  and deal with and acknowledge. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4611.6s)]
*  And 80 percent of Israeli public support for the assault on Gaza is again [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4613.32s)]
*  something we have to acknowledge. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4619.04s)]
*  But we still that doesn't necessarily make it legitimate if we are going to take [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4620.2s)]
*  international law seriously. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4624.719999999999s)]
*  I have a question here. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4628.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, hello. I am Serhat. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4629.639999999999s)]
*  I'm a medical doctor from Belgium and I worked in the West Bank before. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4631.24s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4634.84s)]
*  My question is, after the US embassy relocation to Jerusalem, the recognition [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4636.08s)]
*  of the Golan Heights as part of Israel and the full support for Israel, despite [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4642.28s)]
*  more than 30,000 lives, what's the US position and credibility on this matter [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4648.719999999999s)]
*  after, I mean, like negotiation and after this issue? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4656.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a good question. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4661.24s)]
*  I think. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4663.8s)]
*  US credibility and certainly our proclamations about the rules-based order [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4666.8s)]
*  and international law have taken an enormous hit. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4671.4s)]
*  And I've actually written a piece about comparing Ukraine and Gaza because, again, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4674.24s)]
*  as someone who I think the way that the Biden administration has handled the Russian [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4679.08s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine, all things considered has been pretty good. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4683.28s)]
*  It espoused a set of principles. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4686.48s)]
*  It rallied allies. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4688.2s)]
*  It's not sending US troops. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4690.5599999999995s)]
*  It's supporting Ukraine's right to defend itself. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4691.839999999999s)]
*  Some would argue that Biden's not doing enough. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4695.04s)]
*  I argue that Biden is actually behaving in a way consistent with a kind of restraint [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4696.759999999999s)]
*  oriented foreign policy and producing an effective outcome. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4700.72s)]
*  But he's doing it based on a set of really important principles. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4703.240000000001s)]
*  And the response to October 7 and the aftermath has shown that those principles [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4707.08s)]
*  are hollow. It has shown that the so-called rules-based order is something the United [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4712.4800000000005s)]
*  States, it preserves for its allies different rules for others, a different set of [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4718.72s)]
*  rules. And I think that you're analogizing Israel to Russia here. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4723.84s)]
*  I mean, yes, I mean, Israel's operation in Gaza, even if you agree with President [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4728.56s)]
*  Biden that it's over the top, it was not an unprovoked attack. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4735.12s)]
*  I agree with that. But I'm saying for the administration to come right out of the [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4738.76s)]
*  gate and say that Russia is cutting off food and water and electricity to Ukrainian [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4743.24s)]
*  civilians is unacceptable. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4748.68s)]
*  And we have never heard them say that about Israel using that exact same tactic on [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4752.0s)]
*  Gazans and not just post October 7. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4757.12s)]
*  I mean, Gaza was under various severity of blockade and siege for a very long time. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4759.24s)]
*  But there are things that they were unequivocal about, rightly, that Russia was [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4766.92s)]
*  doing to Ukrainians, that suddenly it becomes, well, we haven't really assessed [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4770.64s)]
*  that when the whole world can see it's happening in Gaza. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4775.84s)]
*  So, again, I acknowledge the differences between these two things. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4779.44s)]
*  But as to your question of like, what role does the U.S. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4784.32s)]
*  have to play in the aftermath? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4786.639999999999s)]
*  Listen, the U.S. is Israel's most important partner. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4788.4s)]
*  It is the only it will remain the only country that can actually give Israel the [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4792.2s)]
*  guarantees and the support that Israel will require to make any agreement when we if [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4796.04s)]
*  and when we finally get there, I hope when so to that, just that alone is going to [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4800.839999999999s)]
*  continue to make the United States relevant in this. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4806.36s)]
*  OK, we have a question here. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4809.919999999999s)]
*  My name is Jason. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4812.36s)]
*  I'm a research assistant for Professor Graham Allison here at the Belfer Center. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4813.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'd like to ask you about the Houthis. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4817.839999999999s)]
*  It seems that the three critiques that people have the Biden administration is that [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4820.639999999999s)]
*  it's either getting us into a broader war and escalating or it's not going far [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4825.4s)]
*  enough or if we focus on resolving the war in Gaza, the Houthi problem will go away. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4829.759999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering if you take one of those three positions or where you land in between them. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4836.48s)]
*  You run through them one more time or either that airstrikes against the Houthis are [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4841.36s)]
*  escalating tensions or that we aren't going far enough in punishing the Houthis and [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4846.799999999999s)]
*  Iran or that the real focus should still be on the war in Gaza. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4851.96s)]
*  And the key is resolving that war instead of taking any measures against the Houthis. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4858.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think Gaza is the driving event here, clearly. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4863.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not to pretend that the Houthis have hearts of gold. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4868.48s)]
*  I mean, they've taken the opportunity here to kind of externalize some of their own domestic problems. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4872.36s)]
*  They're ineffective rulers. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4877.2s)]
*  They're in their own way. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4879.44s)]
*  So they've kind of jumped on this opportunity. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4880.919999999999s)]
*  I have concerns about the strategy of striking the Houthis first because I don't think [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4883.4s)]
*  it's legal under US law. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4889.599999999999s)]
*  We are effectively at war with the Houthis in Yemen under what congressional authorization? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4891.759999999999s)]
*  There was actually a conversation about this in the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4896.84s)]
*  just the other day. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4900.4400000000005s)]
*  It's taken a long time to have that conversation, but I mean, it is real. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4901.4400000000005s)]
*  It's also because it's just it's not working. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4905.24s)]
*  You know, getting back to this question of restoring deterrence, that's what they say. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4907.56s)]
*  Well, listen, when you've been striking targets for the for weeks, you are not restoring anything. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4912.12s)]
*  You're just in a war. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4916.92s)]
*  You know, so again, there's also just that practical what they're doing is not working. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4918.84s)]
*  So I think but but again, I think not to pretend that everything in the Middle East is somehow [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4924.56s)]
*  derivative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Gaza. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4928.88s)]
*  But I do think it is kind of a precipitating event for a lot of the unrest that we're seeing. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4932.4400000000005s)]
*  And the last point on Iran, certainly, you know, Iran has shown that it's shown an interesting [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4936.68s)]
*  amount of restraint, I would say. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4943.360000000001s)]
*  Clearly, it does not want to get drawn into something bigger. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4945.240000000001s)]
*  It's part of its influence or strength, if I can call it that, relies on its own deterrence, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4949.92s)]
*  right? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4955.36s)]
*  And it only gets to pull the trigger of a major conflict one time, and it does not want [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4956.36s)]
*  to do that. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4960.08s)]
*  And I'm glad about that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4961.08s)]
*  And I'm also I think even though this we have seen this conflict spreading Lebanon, Syria, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4962.08s)]
*  Yemen, I do think the diplomatic effort to try and contain it as hard as it has been [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4970.4s)]
*  has been something I give the Biden administration some credit for, although I wish they would [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4976.36s)]
*  take the obvious step and act in a stronger way on Gaza. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4981.4s)]
*  All right, we have time for one more question. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4986.32s)]
*  So right here in the first row. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4988.599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4994.839999999999s)]
*  Just hold the mic to your mouth. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4996.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=4998.32s)]
*  I'll try to make it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5002.719999999999s)]
*  I think I even if I resonate with everything you like, how you analyze the Israeli-Palestinian [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5007.04s)]
*  conflict, I want to put it aside for a second. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5014.679999999999s)]
*  And I think you ignored, in my personal opinion, from a very important aspect. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5017.12s)]
*  And this is like Hamas. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5022.16s)]
*  The way I see it, I don't really see it related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5024.44s)]
*  I think there are, you know, jihadist extremist organization, which is part of a larger global trend. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5031.08s)]
*  And you seem to kind of ignoring ignore that. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5041.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5044.72s)]
*  You talked about pragmatism, but then you said, well, they are there. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5046.72s)]
*  The Israelis will have to accept it. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5051.24s)]
*  But it's not just the Israelis problem. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5053.28s)]
*  It's a worldwide problem. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5056.36s)]
*  And you talked with your lenses of, you know, liberalism and human rights. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5058.36s)]
*  But these are not the lenses that they're perceiving the world. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5064.4s)]
*  And they will never perceive the world. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5067.799999999999s)]
*  You also compared it to Ireland or other. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5069.799999999999s)]
*  And this there is no, in my opinion, way to even compare it, because those are different points of view. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5072.92s)]
*  So how do you even address it? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5082.84s)]
*  Because this is not an Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5084.88s)]
*  Can I maybe, you know, because I think that's a really important question. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5089.08s)]
*  What do you say to somebody who says, you know, Hamas is like the Nazi Party. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5094.2s)]
*  Maybe they don't have the Nazi Party's tools. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5100.12s)]
*  But all you need to do is read their charter, as you said, you know, it's their version of Mein Kampf. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5103.36s)]
*  We see it. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5108.96s)]
*  It's a struggle that many Arab countries are dealing with this kind of thought. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5109.96s)]
*  And Gaza right now is the battleground. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5115.4400000000005s)]
*  And we're on the maybe on the cusp of victory against this kind of thought. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5118.4400000000005s)]
*  Why would we stop now? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5123.52s)]
*  Is that, you know, maybe I'm going further than she would. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5125.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no, I appreciate your but I think your question is a good one. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5129.12s)]
*  But again, I don't. Yes, if one one can choose, I think, to see Hamas as part of this global trend, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5133.4s)]
*  I mean, I think there's evidence of the Muslim Brotherhood. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5139.8s)]
*  I agree. But that brings with it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5144.360000000001s)]
*  There are differences within the Muslim Brotherhood between different factions of jihad groups. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5145.92s)]
*  There is clearly something there. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5154.56s)]
*  I'm not dismissing it, but also I think Hamas has made clear that it is there is an element of Palestinian nationalism to Hamas. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5156.28s)]
*  I mean, that's just clear. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5165.8s)]
*  That's part of how they have built their reputation. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5167.64s)]
*  And also, let's let's recognize that this is part of why they were allowed to exist as the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood in the first place. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5170.88s)]
*  Your question. Yeah, as I said, there. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5182.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, that was a version of hers. But I mean, what's that? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5185.120000000001s)]
*  The question that I asked. Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5188.160000000001s)]
*  No. Well, I think we kind of ran over this earlier in the conversation. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5190.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't approve. I think their ideology is ugly. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5193.64s)]
*  I can say that about a lot of groups around the world. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5196.4s)]
*  What I don't want to do is kind of exceptionalize Hamas when we are talking about political groups, because I don't agree with that. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5199.24s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to pretend that all groups are the same. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5206.639999999999s)]
*  Certainly, like Hamas is not the IRA or Sinn Fein. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5208.599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to pretend that they are equivalent. But there are similarities. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5211.759999999999s)]
*  We have other examples in history where we have dealt with extremist groups who have atrocious ideologies of violence and brought them to the table. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5214.839999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5224.72s)]
*  I do think that that same realism and pragmatism could also be applied to Saudi Arabia. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5227.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're basically saying, let's overlook what happened on October 7th. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5235.56s)]
*  Right. No, that's a great. No, I actually want to answer that. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5239.8s)]
*  That's a fair. But I am saying let's understand that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5242.24s)]
*  Let's see what we can get them to do and not do and not out of the gate say, no, we're just not going to talk. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5245.68s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5251.88s)]
*  Yeah. OK, fair enough. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5253.12s)]
*  So we are actually at the end of our time. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5254.320000000001s)]
*  And I will just say, Matt, first of all, thank you for coming here. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5256.4400000000005s)]
*  I think everybody in this room, even if they didn't agree with everything you said, will come away from this, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5260.04s)]
*  having realized that they were just in an encounter with formidable intellect who is assiduously applying that intellect to the cause of peace in the world. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5267.52s)]
*  And so we are very grateful to you for coming and sharing your views. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFSQmf49OU&t=5279.52s)]
