# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with H.E. Tzipi Livni
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y)
*  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Tariq Massoud. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=5.5s)]
*  I'm the Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Governance at the Kennedy School of Government. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=7.18s)]
*  And I'm also the faculty director of our Middle East Initiative. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=13.58s)]
*  And it's my great pleasure to welcome you today to another installment of our continuing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=17.16s)]
*  series of Middle East dialogues. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=23.56s)]
*  This is a series that we began last year to bring to Harvard genuine, candid, and open [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=26.32s)]
*  conversations about the conflict in Israel and Palestine and how it might be brought [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=32.52s)]
*  to an end. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=38.96s)]
*  In this series, we've spoken with a wide array of people who hold very different views on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=40.5s)]
*  the conflict, its causes, and how to end it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=48.2s)]
*  We spoke with former advisor to President Trump, Jared Kushner. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=51.0s)]
*  We spoke to Matt Duss, who was a former advisor to Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=55.52s)]
*  We spoke with the Palestinian academic, Adelal Arakat, the former Palestinian Prime Minister, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=60.78s)]
*  Salam Fayyad. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=66.92s)]
*  We spoke with Einat Wilf, a former member of the Knesset in Israel, the conservative [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=68.78s)]
*  New York Times columnist, Brett Stevens. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  We talked to former Saudi diplomat, Turki Al-Faisal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=77.04s)]
*  And just a few weeks ago, we spoke with Huseim Zumlet, who's the Palestinian envoy to the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=81.4s)]
*  United Kingdom. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=87.18s)]
*  And today, we're joined by a very distinguished Israeli public servant, a diplomat, and a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=88.2s)]
*  warrior on behalf of her country, and that is Tzipi Livni. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=95.34s)]
*  To recite Tzipi Livni's CV would take far more time than we have. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=100.94s)]
*  But it's not an exaggeration to say that her excellency is one of the most accomplished [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=107.26s)]
*  Israelis of her generation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=112.14s)]
*  She's a former intelligence officer and lawyer who rose to hold several ministerial positions, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  including but not limited to Minister of Justice, Deputy Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=120.86s)]
*  She's also the last Israeli to negotiate directly with the Palestinians, which is something [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=127.18s)]
*  I had not really realized until I heard her talk about that fact on a recent podcast. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=132.54s)]
*  Probably more important than any of those things, of course, is the fact that she was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=140.1s)]
*  here at Harvard in 2019 as a Fisher family fellow. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=143.9s)]
*  And I certainly can't think of anybody who I would rather talk to and have my students [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=149.14s)]
*  talk to about what is happening in Israel and in the broader region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=154.9s)]
*  We will talk for about an hour and then we will open up the floor to questions with the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=160.74s)]
*  aim of ending at around 1.30. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  I want to note that today's event is being recorded. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  It will be posted online. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=173.78s)]
*  And so if you choose to ask a question during the Q&A period, please know that your question, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  your voice, and your name will be recorded and shared with the world forever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  With that, please join me in welcoming back to Harvard Her Excellency Sippy Livni. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=188.1s)]
*  Your Excellency, at this moment, if we were in person, you would be hearing thunderous applause [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=194.82s)]
*  and then we would dive right into the discussion. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=199.3s)]
*  But thank you so much for doing this and for joining us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=202.18s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=206.74s)]
*  These are crucial moments, maybe, for our region. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=209.3s)]
*  I would like to share my views about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=213.22s)]
*  We're grateful to you for making the time to do that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=216.1s)]
*  So Your Excellency, I usually start these conversations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  Can we start by changing the Excellency to Sippy or Miss Livni? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  It would be more convenient for me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=227.77999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=230.66s)]
*  Well, to be on a first name basis with you would be an honor. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=230.98s)]
*  I just let the record show that I will accede to your request and call you Sippy, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  but in my head, I'm calling you Your Excellency. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Professor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=245.94s)]
*  No, you can just call me Dark. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=248.17999999999998s)]
*  So I usually start these conversations by trying to dive into the hardest question I can think of. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=250.5s)]
*  And people who participate in this series understand that our approach here really is to try to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  elicit the fullest possible expression of your views. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  And so sometimes the questions that I'll ask might sound like they come from wildly [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=268.5s)]
*  different ideological perspectives, but the goal is really for the questions to reflect what I think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=274.66s)]
*  are very diverse audiences thinking and to get your thoughts and help thereby possibly enable [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=281.38000000000005s)]
*  us to sharpen our own thinking. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  But before I do that, I was reminded in our last session with Hesam Zumlut, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=289.94000000000005s)]
*  who's the Palestinian envoy to the UK, of the profound pain that the current moment [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  represents for both the people of Israel and Palestine, that both of the people of your [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=301.62s)]
*  country and the people of Palestine are suffering and that the Palestinians and Israelis that we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=308.1s)]
*  speak to in this series aren't just disembodied brains who can offer us their dispassionate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=313.14s)]
*  analysis, but they are actually real flesh and blood human beings who are experiencing every bit [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=319.3s)]
*  the pain that their peoples are experiencing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=326.02s)]
*  You know, you're you Tzipi are a mother, you're a grandmother. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=328.74s)]
*  I know that at least one of your sons is a paratrooper in the military, and I know that you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  have lost friends. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=339.3s)]
*  And so I just wanted to start by asking, how are you and your family? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=340.42s)]
*  How have you been during this past year? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  I will never forget October 7th and the following days. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=350.82s)]
*  I believe that all of these Israelis are still under this trauma of the unbelievable, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=354.82s)]
*  unthinkable atrocities. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=362.18s)]
*  We still have hostages in Gaza. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=365.54s)]
*  And that was the day where the first message that I got was that the good friend of mine, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=371.86s)]
*  that was the mayor of the regional council on the border, was still defending his home. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=382.42s)]
*  I was in Milano in Malpensa Airport on the way to a meeting or after a family vacation on my way [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=392.66s)]
*  to a meeting with the group that we used to discuss, the state of the world, the global [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=400.98s)]
*  democracy group that was established by Secretary Albright and later was replaced by [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=407.7s)]
*  Secretary Clinton. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=416.34s)]
*  And I was sitting on the plane on my way and then I've heard that this is what's happening. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=418.97999999999996s)]
*  So I asked to get off the plane and change the direction back to Israel where my family joined [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=424.58s)]
*  me and my son was not serving but he was called to the reserve. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=432.34s)]
*  And then during the day and the next days we heard about the atrocities and I cannot [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=441.62s)]
*  forget or I cannot escape from these images of rapes, of people that their organs are being [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  cut, that they are being tortured, of children that are hiding in closets. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=458.82s)]
*  October 7th for Israelis, it's not only the number of people of Israelis that were killed [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  during this horrible day but it has a holocaustic nature not because of the number [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=476.82s)]
*  but because of the situation of helpless children that were kidnapped from other beds, that were [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=485.94s)]
*  watching their parents being killed, that were tortured and these atrocities are [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=495.54s)]
*  it's quite even difficult to absorb even now and we are still living this moment in a way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=503.86s)]
*  Yeah well I was in Israel in March of 2024 and I remember just being struck by how even households [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=513.3s)]
*  that were not directly touched by what happened on October 7th or did not have direct family [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=527.4599999999999s)]
*  members who were held hostage still seemed to be in almost like a state of suspended animation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  Many people said to me my life will commence again once the hostages are free and so I... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=542.26s)]
*  No and not only that because since that day, yes I was speaking about the same day and the same [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=549.78s)]
*  week but later now it's to have months, sleepless nights when your son is in reserve or some of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=557.38s)]
*  your friends or other family members and getting every morning at 6 a.m. the names of those that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=567.7s)]
*  were killed and in a way you know my grandson was nine months old on October 7th and this was the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=577.62s)]
*  same age of Fyobivas, the baby that was kidnapped and it took me some time to separate this because [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=587.62s)]
*  since then I was looking at my grandson and thinking about Fyobivas. It's not so good but... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=597.7s)]
*  No thank you for sharing that. You know obviously there's an enormous amount of suffering that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  Israelis have experienced as a result of October 7th and there's an enormous amount of suffering [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  that Palestinians have been experiencing since October 7th and indeed one of the things you often [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  hear and we heard this from Husein Zoumelet is that for the Palestinians the suffering didn't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=626.34s)]
*  start on October 7th and particularly for the people of Gaza you often hear the formulation [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=632.02s)]
*  that Gaza before October 7th was akin to an open-air prison. I'm sure we could talk about [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=638.82s)]
*  the details of that. I don't think you would doubt though that the situation in Gaza was a very dire [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=646.34s)]
*  one before October 7th and I guess so I guess the question I want to ask your excellency is how do [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=652.34s)]
*  you respond to people who say that yes what happened on October 7th was a great atrocity [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=659.46s)]
*  however it was the result of another atrocity which has been the systematic squeezing of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=665.46s)]
*  people of Gaza since the Israeli disengagement. Okay so let's speak about this situation in Gaza [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=674.34s)]
*  and let's go back not to October 7th but before October 7th let's go back to 2005 when I was [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  ministering the Israeli government and believing in peace between Israel and the Palestinians [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=688.4200000000001s)]
*  based on two states for two peoples and we made a decision that tore the Israeli society apart [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=694.26s)]
*  and it was to disengage from Gaza to dismantle all the settlements. I made a decision to evacuate [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=700.98s)]
*  Israelis that were born there but to take them from Gaza to Israel to pull out our forces [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=708.34s)]
*  and to give the people in Gaza the opportunity to rebuild Gaza to live in freedom and hopefully in [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=717.86s)]
*  peace and then Hamas took over and the entire international community made a decision on [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=727.22s)]
*  January 20 or 6 saying that every Palestinian government wants to get legitimacy and if Gaza [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=734.02s)]
*  wants to be open to the world this is possible if they will renounce violence and terrorism [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=741.86s)]
*  and recognize the right of Israel to exist and abide to the Oslo agreement which was the peace [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=749.5400000000001s)]
*  treaty between Israel and the Palestinians. So for those thinking that Hamas represent any [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=755.7s)]
*  legitimate cause of the Palestinians no it's not and for those thinking that these are freedom [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=761.86s)]
*  fighters the way to bring freedom to Gaza was by renounce violence and terrorism and not by using [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=768.1s)]
*  terror so this is just to understand what happened to Gaza we didn't we never wanted and we don't [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=775.46s)]
*  want now to reoccupy Gaza but we want and we are responsible for the life of Israelis women and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=783.54s)]
*  children that are living in Israel near the border this is one thing secondly I would not accept [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=792.5799999999999s)]
*  the comparison between these terrorists. Jihadist group that is not fighting for the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=802.42s)]
*  establishment of Palestinian state they are completely against the idea of two states for [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=812.9s)]
*  two peoples because they are against the existence of the state of Israel and while they are targeting [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=818.02s)]
*  uh civilians and children as part of their jihadist ideology the Israeli army is acting [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=826.74s)]
*  against terror as I said before on October 6 there was no one Israeli sector no one Israeli [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=836.74s)]
*  soldier within Gaza street and we are trying to avoid civil casualties but this is happening [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=844.58s)]
*  and the loss of child to Israelis or Palestinians is the same grief and sorrow and pain [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=851.5400000000001s)]
*  but I would ask the world the international community not to make this moral or legal [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=860.74s)]
*  equivalent because there is no equivalence for example for somebody uh or premeditated [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=867.86s)]
*  murder or executed premeditated murder and somebody who killed by I don't know mistake [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=874.26s)]
*  or even negligence no moral equivalence no legal equivalence uh so I understand the pain of the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=880.34s)]
*  Palestinians uh uh uh shield understanding is something that you think about but I can [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=889.54s)]
*  understand it uh but I would not accept this uh comparison and the real question that we should [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=895.78s)]
*  all ask ourselves how to create a better future for Israelis and Palestinians the same [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=903.22s)]
*  Thank you um Sippy so so there's a lot to to to um to address here um you know the let me first [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=910.98s)]
*  try to restate what I what I think I I heard your response uh to the argument was so so your response [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=920.02s)]
*  the argument that well the people of Gaza were held in an open air prison uh the the condition [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=927.7s)]
*  no you're misunderstanding me that's the argument to which you're responding yes thank you so I'm [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=937.54s)]
*  just restating the argument and then your response to that was your response to that was look we left [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=943.54s)]
*  in uh 2006 uh we made it very clear to the people of Gaza that if you are willing to live in peace [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=950.74s)]
*  with us we will live in peace with you but they chose an a different path they chose the path of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=958.02s)]
*  launching rockets etc that that would that be a fair description of your response am I missing [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=965.94s)]
*  up a point there yes I'm not saying that this was the choice of all the people in Gaza but this is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=971.94s)]
*  what they voted for and this is what in a way they are also being costages during Gaza [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=978.9s)]
*  by Hamas for many years now so so so used as shields yeah so might respond and say look I know [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=985.6999999999999s)]
*  that um Israel formally withdrew from Gaza however it still occupied Gaza you know analytically it was [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=994.5s)]
*  still the occupier of Gaza after all you know in 2001 Israel had destroyed the airport that the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1004.1s)]
*  Gazans have since 2007 there's been a massive naval blockade of Gaza nothing gets in and out of Gaza [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1010.98s)]
*  with or very little gets in and out of Gaza without the Israelis and their Egyptian uh uh [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1018.26s)]
*  colleagues uh knowing about it and so these are people who really were not in any real sense [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1024.42s)]
*  free to establish or determine their own uh uh uh development and trajectory and then on top of that [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1031.94s)]
*  the occupation of the West Bank continuing and the ongoing uh uh uh uh uh seizure of land that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1042.4199999999998s)]
*  Palestinians believe to be theirs so in other words that there you know this is what we saw [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1050.6599999999999s)]
*  on October 7th was not a sneak attack from a neighboring country but rather it was a response [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1057.54s)]
*  violent illegitimate no agreed it was not a response you were occupying sorry go ahead it [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1067.06s)]
*  was not a response it was initiated by a group that doesn't represent any legitimate cause they [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1074.02s)]
*  believe in this jihadist ideology that would not accept my existence in their neighborhood [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1082.34s)]
*  we left Gaza Strip we don't want to control you know when you are coming to the states or any [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1090.98s)]
*  country you are being checked because of the security of the country that you are entry to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1096.66s)]
*  when we left Gaza Strip we truly didn't want not to be there not to supervise uh we wanted the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1103.3s)]
*  border between uh uh Gaza Strip and Egypt to be supervised not by this world by Europeans you [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1111.3s)]
*  know what the Europeans did EU bomb the day that Hamas was elected they left the border or the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1118.6599999999999s)]
*  crossing for us and we it took some I mean I was in the Israeli I was not in the Israeli cabinet [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1126.5s)]
*  on October 7th but I was there in different military operations against Hamas in Gaza [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1134.98s)]
*  and it was always the same and we've tried everything I was there we stopped the first time [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1141.78s)]
*  in 2007 hoping that we regain deterrence and they will focus in helping their own people [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1148.98s)]
*  they didn't and they they continue targeting Israel so we tried another military operation [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1156.58s)]
*  and that ended with a kind of an agreement that they will take care of their own people [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1163.38s)]
*  and Israel will not stop from money to enter in order to help the people in Gaza but they [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1170.18s)]
*  use this to build more tunnel to build or to buy or to infiltrate more more weapon so the idea [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1178.42s)]
*  the idea that this was as a response to the situation in Gaza it's not only unfair it doesn't [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1186.98s)]
*  represent the realities on the ground historical facts and you know even more than that I know [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1192.5s)]
*  that there are people that after October 7th start uh you know supporting Hamas and and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1199.78s)]
*  they believe I think that most of them believe that they're supporting uh the Palestinian cause [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1206.74s)]
*  they're supporting uh the Palestinian cause but this is not this is not what they are supporting [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1211.94s)]
*  and I don't believe that there is anybody who can justify justify this kind of for us [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1219.54s)]
*  there is no there can be no reason no excuse to this kind of force now let's speak and I hope [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1228.3400000000001s)]
*  that we can speak during this discussion about okay so if Hamas doesn't represent is there anybody [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1235.94s)]
*  who represents the Palestinian cause what can be done is there any or for peace that's fine but [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1243.14s)]
*  Hamas is an obstacle for peace to Israelis and Palestinians alike this is part of the problem [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1248.98s)]
*  not part of the solution yeah you know I appreciate I appreciate that um uh your [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1257.78s)]
*  excellency so so if you know you know let's talk a little bit about um Hamas you know I um I think [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1264.66s)]
*  you've spoken very clearly about how this is an organization that is not reconciled to Jewish [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1275.0600000000002s)]
*  presence in any part of the holy land you've described them not as freedom fighters trying [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1282.26s)]
*  to establish a Palestinian state but as terrorists trying to destroy a Jewish state [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1288.26s)]
*  and can I ask you when it's not my it's not my description it's their charter it's in their [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1295.3799999999999s)]
*  fair enough when did you and and I guess the the the the the implication of that is that you know [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1301.3799999999999s)]
*  Israel has to deal with this existential threat dealing with that existential threat after [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1311.22s)]
*  October 7th unfortunately results in civilian casualties but Israel doesn't have a choice [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1317.94s)]
*  because the threat is so fearsome as we saw on October 7th is that am I getting your argument [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1325.78s)]
*  right yes and and it this was also my policy or my strategy long before October 7 my strategy for [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1332.8200000000002s)]
*  many years also when I was in the Israeli cabinet was that since since there is no hope for peace [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1342.98s)]
*  with Hamas and since I believe in peace between Israel and the Palestinians the right strategy [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1348.3400000000001s)]
*  was and still is to act against these several jihadist groups when needed including militarily [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1355.3000000000002s)]
*  and simultaneously to work with or to strengthen while weakening this jihadist group there's a need [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1363.6200000000001s)]
*  also to work and to strengthen the more pragmatic leaders that represent a conflict with Israel [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1370.74s)]
*  that represent a national conflict but national conflicts are solvable while religious conflicts [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1379.14s)]
*  are unsolvable because religious conflict is not about your rights but it's about depriving others [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1385.46s)]
*  this kind depriving Jews or Israelis from believing in in or expressing their own faiths [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1394.02s)]
*  while national conflicts hopefully is solvable so so this is this is very helpful but you know [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1401.6200000000001s)]
*  somebody might respond and say the following somebody might respond and say you know you'd [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1410.02s)]
*  be absolutely right your excellency in saying that you know it's it's Israel's right of self-defense [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1415.46s)]
*  to its campaign against Gaza right now is consistent with its right of self-defense [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1425.54s)]
*  and the fact that civilians are dying is a tragedy but there is often collateral damage in when you [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1431.06s)]
*  are trying to defend yourself a rejoinder to that might be that Sippy Livni and Tariq Massoud knew [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1437.54s)]
*  know something about Hamas which is that it is an organization that is jihadist and unreconciled to [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1444.74s)]
*  Israel but Benjamin Netanyahu in contrast was funding Hamas or channeling funds from [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1453.22s)]
*  enabled enabling yes and so given that Netanyahu enabled Hamas this organization that Sippy Livni [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1461.38s)]
*  could have told him 20 years ago is a terrorist organization that only wants to do you harm [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1470.74s)]
*  when you when you fund Hamas and then Hamas acts in the way that we could have predicted they would [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1477.7s)]
*  act doesn't that mean you do not have the right in your retaliation to make the average Palestinian [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1482.82s)]
*  family suffer by dropping a bomb on their head because the group that you funded acted in ways [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1490.26s)]
*  that were entirely predictable first it's not retaliation that's something that we need to do [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1498.02s)]
*  it's not just you know punishing the Palestinians firstly secondly you know that I'm a long-time [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1505.22s)]
*  political opponent of Netanyahu and I represent my especially things that are connected of views [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1511.78s)]
*  and vision that is connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but let's be fair also [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1519.06s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu you know he funded Hamas he was in a situation where Hamas targeted Israel [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  is the first one maybe not the first one but for sure he knows that Hamas is a terrorist organization [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1531.2199999999998s)]
*  but he was asked to enable Qatar to transfer the money to the people in Gaza and it was the reason [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1537.54s)]
*  that he enables the idea was not to transfer the money to Hamas to build more tunnels or to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1544.9s)]
*  take more weapons or to buy more weapons or to do whatever they want for themselves [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  this was the reason and trust me if we had this conversation years ago and Netanyahu had stopped [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1561.14s)]
*  or say I'm not willing that Qatar or somebody or the Palestinian Authority will transfer money to [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1567.94s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority you would be the first man to ask me or others will criticize Israel for [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1573.54s)]
*  not committing money to come to the people in Gaza to eat for food so this is really this is not a [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1581.1399999999999s)]
*  right question look I think and and as I as I said you the reason that Netanyahu I will maybe [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1590.58s)]
*  that's the time to explain the different opinions in Israel or the different if I may if that's [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1599.38s)]
*  that's okay go ahead okay okay because this maybe will make it clear also what is the internal [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1605.0600000000002s)]
*  dispute in Israel and and well what's the difference between the two not only political [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1611.94s)]
*  views in Israel but it's two different visions for the state of Israel since I believe in Israel as [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1619.3000000000002s)]
*  a nation state for the Jewish people with equal rights to all its cities and secured state in [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1626.66s)]
*  what we call on the land of Israel but I believe that we need to have a Jewish majority we need [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1632.02s)]
*  during this role this is our direction our destination hopefully we can stop in the station [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  find a partner to reach peace with and separate ourselves from the Palestinians into two states [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  that each state gives an answer to national aspiration of different peoples this is I think [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1649.14s)]
*  this is the right and just solution okay let's speak about the feasibility but that's what I [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1654.42s)]
*  believe in during all these years there is another vision for Israel that you see that is being [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1661.38s)]
*  represented this is the Israeli government that's for them it's more about the land of Israel what [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1668.02s)]
*  they call Greater Israel it's less about Israel as a democracy that's why you've seen also the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1672.9s)]
*  internal debate about the judicial reform and Israel's democracy and they do not support oh [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1679.14s)]
*  well this was the understatement they completely oppose the idea of a Palestinian state as part of [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1685.3000000000002s)]
*  two states for two peoples and therefore for me it's not only the Hamas is a problem as a terrorist [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1691.6200000000001s)]
*  organization but it's also a problem on on hopefully a way because it's a to what is because [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1698.98s)]
*  it's a zero sum game amongst the Palestinians but Hamas is stronger the legitimate Palestinian [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1707.06s)]
*  authority is weaker and so on on the other side for Netanyahu and this is also happening now [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1712.74s)]
*  for him strengthening or for these groups in Israel that are opposing the idea of two states [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1720.5s)]
*  for them strengthening the pragmatic forces [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1727.38s)]
*  instead of keeping Hamas was until October 7 something that was part of their policy that's [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1735.3s)]
*  why I believed in acting against the jihadist back strengthening and negotiating with the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1745.14s)]
*  Democratic forces when Netanyahu didn't believe in this but I would not and you know is also being [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1752.5s)]
*  attacked in Israel and not only for letting the money for enabling the money to transfer [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1760.1s)]
*  but what I miss also in Israel that he will be criticized for weakening the Palestinian authority [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1765.3s)]
*  simultaneously yeah yeah okay there's there's a lot to to talk about here I just want to you know [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1770.98s)]
*  two points I actually appreciated I actually appreciate your defense of of Netanyahu [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1777.78s)]
*  then nobody asked me it's very difficult for me to do so but but you know does he deserve that [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1786.1799999999998s)]
*  defense I mean we know now you know it was reported in Haaretz that Netanyahu you you said [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1791.86s)]
*  Netanyahu wasn't funding Hamas all Netanyahu was doing was channel responding to an American [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1798.26s)]
*  request to channel money from the Qataris to the Palestinian people Netanyahu himself in a 2019 [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1803.78s)]
*  Likud party conf faction meeting said look if you oppose a Palestinian state you need to support [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1810.02s)]
*  funds going to Hamas but you know no but you but you know why I did it because I do not defend [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1818.18s)]
*  the idea is not to defend Netanyahu your question was that maybe we Israelis deserve what happened [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1826.02s)]
*  to us no because Netanyahu that's not what I said wrong the money some would say so [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1834.66s)]
*  no and that's not what I said and therefore you missed my point and therefore okay and therefore [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1841.3s)]
*  and therefore and therefore it's not defending Netanyahu I'm saying that it would be an answer [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1846.26s)]
*  to say that okay you enable them you in general you Israelis enable the money and this is what [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1853.62s)]
*  happened to you and therefore I was so trust me as you as you know I am I'm opposing Netanyahu [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1859.3799999999999s)]
*  and I'm glad hope that you will be replaced no I'm glad you you said that by the way because I [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1869.1399999999999s)]
*  clearly didn't express myself clearly I did not mean to say that because Netanyahu funded Hamas [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1874.7399999999998s)]
*  then October 7th was deserved I was making a more subtle moral argument that because [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1882.58s)]
*  Netanyahu funded Hamas Israel's response to October 7th has to be different from its current bombing [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1889.14s)]
*  campaign it has to do much more to avoid civilian casualties if you know be precisely because by [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1897.22s)]
*  the way it's not connected Israel should try to avoid civil casualty because Israel should and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1906.66s)]
*  is acting in accordance to international law and moral values whether we finance or enable the money [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1913.78s)]
*  or not yeah it's not connected let me ask you a slightly different question because you described [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1920.9s)]
*  the Israeli political landscape and where you sit in it and I think most of our listeners would [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1927.3000000000002s)]
*  say that if they had the right to vote in Israel they would almost certainly vote for you but you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1935.22s)]
*  have described there being another a very important a very influential school of thought in Israel [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1940.34s)]
*  which currently runs the country which just like Hamas doesn't want there to be a Jewish state [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1949.46s)]
*  doesn't want there to be anything like a Palestinian state and those are the people who run the country [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1956.26s)]
*  and so I guess for now is if there were a Palestinian sitting with you and the Palestinian [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1963.6200000000001s)]
*  said to you look at who runs Israel what do you want me to do the only path for me is war you know [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1969.38s)]
*  is to try you know how how do you respond to that like what do you want the Palestinians to do [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1977.78s)]
*  given your own description of the current Israeli government's well absolute lack of interest in [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1983.86s)]
*  allowing the Palestinians any kind of self-determination hey I would say the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1991.94s)]
*  Palestinians what I'm saying to myself and to my friends in Israel those that are opposing the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=1996.66s)]
*  current government let's act together in order I'm now speaking to Israelis in order to replace [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2001.3s)]
*  the Israeli government and I hope that the people in Gaza and also in the West Bank would understand [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2009.94s)]
*  that Hamas doesn't help them and the price that they are paying is not just because the enemy [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2016.82s)]
*  namely Israel but because what Hamas causes to Israel and to them as well and hopefully they [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2023.7s)]
*  will replace but you know what it's not a radical question if I had met a Palestinian or if I would [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2030.4199999999998s)]
*  meet a Palestinian I've met them as was mentioned before I negotiated peace with the Abu Mazen [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2038.26s)]
*  with the best in the last two rounds of negotiations and this was the real tragedy of [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2045.14s)]
*  of all of us because in 2008 and in 2014 they were peace plans parameters for peace [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2051.86s)]
*  by the way that resembled to Camp David 2000 with Clinton and Yasser Arafat [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2066.3399999999997s)]
*  and they didn't and Abu Mazen didn't I cannot say that he refused because he didn't but he didn't [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2075.62s)]
*  agree to it yeah and this was and this is what my [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2082.5s)]
*  uh assistant or Dr. Talbecker wrote on you know the yellow pages in the last [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2088.58s)]
*  in the last meeting of our talks in 2014 tragedy but we shouldn't give up and therefore [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2098.74s)]
*  the real question is how to enforce the the pragmatics and the moderates on both sides [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2105.94s)]
*  and speaking about Israel when from the outside when the international community are not [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2112.02s)]
*  taking in consideration or undermining the right of Israel to defend itself it serves [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2121.1400000000003s)]
*  the interests of the extremists in Israel saying yes it's all the same [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2129.06s)]
*  it's no matter what we do it's who it's about who we are yeah and and and therefore this kind [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2136.34s)]
*  of conversation is so important for me as well yeah so so there's a there's you know I you know [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2143.38s)]
*  I want to move now to you know because we could talk a lot about I think the the the history of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2150.42s)]
*  negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians and one thing we've definitely learned is that there [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2158.34s)]
*  are very different perceptions of what happened and what didn't happen and trying to adjudicate [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2165.06s)]
*  those is very difficult but so let's look forward and and the the question I have so we've been [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2170.1s)]
*  beating up on Benjamin Netanyahu a fair bit but another a question that one might um one might [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2176.98s)]
*  ask is you know let's look at the region today um uh Yahya Senwar is dead Ismail Hineya is dead [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2184.98s)]
*  Hamas as an entity is completely decimated um we also um see the same thing with Hezbollah [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2193.22s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah is dead dozens of Hezbollah leaders were killed in a stunning Israeli [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2202.98s)]
*  operation Iran is on the back heel after all it's only state ally Syria has fallen to rebels [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  and these rebels actually don't seem interested in confronting Israel the Abraham Accords uh have [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2218.74s)]
*  held right the Emiratis the Bahrainis the Moroccans nobody has cut their uh relationships with Israel [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2225.06s)]
*  and in fact the Saudis are now in very serious talks about normalizing with your country so [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2232.3399999999997s)]
*  somebody could say from where they sit Israel actually looks much more secure in a much more [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2239.3799999999997s)]
*  powerful position today than it did on October 6th and if I wonder if you agree with that and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2245.3s)]
*  if so if you would say that that means Netanyahu's doing a pretty good job [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2252.5s)]
*  no I would say that there are new opportunities in the region [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2258.02s)]
*  I'm happy that Israel regained deterrence in the region because we need it and since I uh do [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2262.26s)]
*  believe as I said before that uh the right policy or strategy is to act against the jihadists [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2270.5s)]
*  and we succeeded in doing so but now let's go to the other pillar and this is creating uh or [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2276.82s)]
*  strengthening new alliances in the region but not only uh because uh it needs to be implemented [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2284.66s)]
*  also on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so even Gaza uh can turn into hopefully uh uh to to [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2292.5s)]
*  to a better place okay but the real question is what's next also I'll focus at first on [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2305.46s)]
*  Gaza and then we'll speak about the entire region because it is connected [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2311.2200000000003s)]
*  because the goals of the world that Israel declared at the beginning uh was uh were uh to [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2315.7s)]
*  eradicate Hamas as a terrorist organization to release the hostages uh and to um to topple Hamas [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2323.06s)]
*  as a regime and I believe that these three goals are the right goals now Israel succeeded in the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2333.06s)]
*  first called the military uh action uh the release of those soldiers I truly hope that we'll see [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2339.38s)]
*  the system coming back on but the question of toppling Hamas as a regime this is connected [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2346.82s)]
*  to what I've shared with you before about two different uh state of mind or visions in Israel [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2353.54s)]
*  because I believe that the only way to topple a regime is by replacing it and the real question [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2359.38s)]
*  is with whom and there is a very weak Palestinian authority we cannot just throw the keys to the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2365.7s)]
*  other side of the border and hope that they will catch it because last time in 2007 Hamas killed [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2372.18s)]
*  most of them in Gaza but there is an opportunity to work with the emirates with Egypt with the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2377.3799999999997s)]
*  Palestinian authority in changing the situation on the ground uh giving Israel the right to act [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2385.54s)]
*  against terror but uh to do it in a manner that will be orchestrated hopefully by the United States [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2392.82s)]
*  and Saudi can be also another very important component not only by joining in the reconstruction [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2402.5s)]
*  or helping the Palestinians but also uh maybe in joining with our normalization but [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2411.1400000000003s)]
*  their condition is that Israel will take steps toward the Palestinians or toward the Palestinian [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2419.06s)]
*  state and this is something that as I said before I believe this is an Israeli interest to do so [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2424.58s)]
*  so all together we can change the situation gradually it will take time and should be in steps [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2430.9s)]
*  because it's security matters here and but yet if we have the emirates and the Saudis [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2437.54s)]
*  joining this we can create new alliances in the region when the jihadists and the extremists in [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2447.54s)]
*  the region now in a very low uh in a very low position yeah well well um you know this is this [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2455.06s)]
*  is the the natural question that somebody might respond and particularly people in the Arab world [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2463.8599999999997s)]
*  might respond and they say look at Tzipi Lifni your vision for the day after in Gaza and for [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2470.58s)]
*  ultimately getting to a solution to this problem involves the Arab countries coming in spending [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2476.9s)]
*  billions of dollars to try to rebuild the territory that you destroyed and serving as sort of policemen [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2483.06s)]
*  uh crack Palestinian skulls etc while the Gaza remains open to the Israelis for their periodic [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2490.42s)]
*  anti-terrorism operations all the while unless there is no terror you know fair enough but all [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2498.26s)]
*  the while without a Palestinian state actually being established so so many Arabs will say no [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2504.5s)]
*  Israel just wants to make us complicit in advancing the occupation and then they say slowly [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2511.38s)]
*  and then they talk about a gradual move to a Palestinian state we saw that movie before [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2516.7400000000002s)]
*  move to a Palestinian state we saw that movie before with Oslo and you know the Palestinian [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2522.34s)]
*  state entity during the time of of Salem Fayyad was widely recognized to basically be [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2529.78s)]
*  a fairly capable uh capable state they could have operated uh independently at that moment in time [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2536.98s)]
*  now we're in a very different different position and so I think many many of the Arab countries [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2544.34s)]
*  the Saudis for example are not saying take concrete steps to a Palestinian state they're saying [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2549.7s)]
*  have a Palestinian state acknowledge a Palestinian state um you know don't you think you know how do [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2555.14s)]
*  you respond to somebody who says the time is long past for the Palestinians to finally have their [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2562.18s)]
*  self-determination the kind of half measures that you're describing are just non-starters and [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2569.22s)]
*  certainly Arab countries are not going to spend money and lives being complicit in the Israel the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2574.82s)]
*  next phase of the Israeli occupation right away somebody says that uh firstly um you know the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2582.7400000000002s)]
*  choice in the middle east is usually between bad options these are the choices that choices that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2590.5s)]
*  Israel is is facing it's also some part of the Arab world I do believe and not only believe I know [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2595.38s)]
*  that uh these jihadist groups uh whether it's Hamas or the Shia groups Hezbollah and the others [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2602.34s)]
*  they are a threat to most of the Arab the moderate Arabs in our region as well and they are willing [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2610.26s)]
*  they don't they are not going to do so because Israel is asking them to do so this this is the [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  role of the Palestinian authority that's why I'm saying also in Israel and in Hebrew uh after [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2622.02s)]
*  Netanyahu succeeded in turning the Palestinian authority saying that this is like Hamas no it's [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2630.82s)]
*  not but it's too weak for now so let's work together with them they will be those that will invite [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2636.1800000000003s)]
*  either the emirates or other to join them but this should be a it's a very complicated jigsaw [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2645.46s)]
*  and I'm not suggesting like after other military operation in Gaza yes now you should invest your [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2652.7400000000002s)]
*  money in Gaza until the next round of violence yeah if Hamas remain in power this terrible [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2658.9s)]
*  situation this war a more than a year that both parties pay their price will be just another round [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2666.9s)]
*  if Hamas remains in office and therefore I'm not suggesting like another military operation now [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2675.2200000000003s)]
*  after the operation invest your money until the next time no let's start in doing something [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2681.78s)]
*  together in in agreeing I believe as I said before that those states for two peoples as long [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2688.34s)]
*  as it keeps Israel's security I believe that this is an Israeli interest and therefore you know I know [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2695.06s)]
*  that it's difficult maybe impossible for the current Israeli government to acknowledge this or to say [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2703.94s)]
*  it but you know what I want Israelis to know that there is another option and the other option [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2709.78s)]
*  is a very responsible one not just you know I'm not speaking in a naive manner I don't think that [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2719.38s)]
*  there is a piece around the corner as I told you before I negotiate this and there are not by the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2726.5s)]
*  way no different positions or about what happened I think that the Palestinians would acknowledge [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2732.5s)]
*  that this is what happened by they did agree to and sometimes when the Palestinian choice is between [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2739.62s)]
*  a hundred if they are not getting now the hundred percent what they got during all this is is zero [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2746.5s)]
*  and sometimes let's have Gaza as a beginning because you know what I'm being blamed by [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2754.58s)]
*  Israelis that I supported the disengagement plan that this cause caused what happened to Israel so [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2761.14s)]
*  it's quite difficult also you are speaking about how the Palestinian and I understand it but you [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2767.7s)]
*  know that in Israel people that supported this in the past are not holding the same position [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2774.3399999999997s)]
*  and and it's very important to to to show and to take it step by step in a very responsible manner [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2780.18s)]
*  to show that there is an open road to another future because otherwise I mean it's going to be [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2787.78s)]
*  just another round yeah so so I have a lot of people who want to ask you questions and so [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2796.1800000000003s)]
*  I have two more I have many more than two more questions but I'll ask two more questions and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2803.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll open it up to the audience and and I actually want to just ask you to comment on the [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2807.46s)]
*  international situation so you know we're obviously speaking virtually at Harvard University [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2814.66s)]
*  a institution that I know is not you know very well loved in Israel at the present time because [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2821.62s)]
*  it's seen along with many other American universities as being a a place where that [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2829.94s)]
*  where we saw many protests against is what what Israelis see as their war of self-defense [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2837.14s)]
*  but it's not just at Harvard it's not just at American universities if we look [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2844.1s)]
*  internationally there's a I think Israel's international reputation has absolutely [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2849.06s)]
*  suffered you know the country is literally on trial for genocide there are arrest warrants issued [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2854.98s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court for the Prime Minister and the former Minister of Defense what [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2861.54s)]
*  do you think is going on there what what is Tzipi Livni's explanation for why big swaths of global [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2868.34s)]
*  public opinion seem to have turned against Israel? It's a combination well I am frustrated because [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2876.98s)]
*  I believe that Israel is and should be a part respected member or part of the free world [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2889.5400000000004s)]
*  because this is who we are and at first you know after October 7th I thought or before October 7th [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2898.6600000000003s)]
*  I used to think that young people feel empathy to those that they are in this conflict are the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2904.9s)]
*  the weakest or the weaker and there was also you know the Palestinian child and the Israeli tank [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2915.0600000000004s)]
*  as by we believe or feel that we are the Davids of the region for so many years [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2922.18s)]
*  when the international community we look for my bird eye they are looking from a Google Earth [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2929.86s)]
*  point of view and this is and then I was surprised to see right after October 7th when we were the [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2935.22s)]
*  weeks when children will be really murdered and killed and burned and then just afterwards [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2941.94s)]
*  I learned that there are October 7th deniers [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2953.2200000000003s)]
*  that it's not even about facts or what happened so it is a combination so if I take a side [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2959.38s)]
*  because I think that this is a task it's a challenge for Israel today so if I take [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2967.14s)]
*  aside anti-semitic views or anti-semitic views I think that there is a generation those that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2974.58s)]
*  were taking the streets and I wish like they would understand I mean they feel maybe that [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2981.2999999999997s)]
*  they represent I don't know that the higher moral ground which is not because if you support Hamas [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2991.22s)]
*  this is not moral if you want to support the Palestinians that this is not the choice is not [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=2999.14s)]
*  between Israel and the Palestinians it's when you call from the river to the sea it's you are [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3004.3399999999997s)]
*  calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and if you want to state for two people as a just [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3011.62s)]
*  solution so this is not what you represent and I feel I think that there is also lack of not only [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3018.18s)]
*  of knowledge of history of what happened I feel sometimes that I need to explain that Israel's [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3029.06s)]
*  creation is not the problem but was part of the solution that the United Nations decided in 1947 [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3037.2999999999997s)]
*  as an end for a conflict that the Arab didn't accept you know I see now on both sides [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3045.78s)]
*  our young people are going with the pendant of the same of the same place [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3053.5400000000004s)]
*  for some it's Palestine for the others it's the land of Israel and this brings us back to 1947 [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3062.34s)]
*  before the United Nations partition plane about creating of two states an Arab state and a Jewish [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3070.1s)]
*  state so it's I believe that there's a need [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3075.94s)]
*  to it's a Israel is losing its legitimacy it's not only I mean I there's a need I'll make sure [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3090.1s)]
*  there's a need to differentiate to make a difference between criticizing an Israeli [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3099.78s)]
*  government policy any Israeli government policy I criticize my own government policy okay I was [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3109.3s)]
*  the leader of the opposition in Israel especially things that are connected to the conflict to [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3115.46s)]
*  states whether to do this or that this is acceptable but when you undermine our right or the legitimacy [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3120.5800000000004s)]
*  of Israel to exist this is unacceptable and this doesn't represent any moral views yeah it's it's [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3129.54s)]
*  okay I think I hope that I was understood yeah no no I think you are understood I'm going to ask you [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3140.5s)]
*  just a quick quick thought you know I heard you once say uh your excellency that you believe that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3145.54s)]
*  the right to the entire land of Israel um and I guess my question for you is what do you think [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3153.14s)]
*  is the Palestinian right what do they have a right to in your view I think that this is the [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3161.46s)]
*  I will show you my first meeting in my first negotiations with at the time it was the Palestinian [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3168.02s)]
*  prime minister and we were talking about rights okay I was speaking about the rights of the Jewish [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3176.34s)]
*  people on the entire land the map of greater Israel is tattooed you know on my parents uh the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3182.58s)]
*  stone of their grave because they believed in me and he was I was speaking about the biblical [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3190.58s)]
*  judicial historical rights of the Jewish people and he was speaking about his family and how many [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3196.42s)]
*  years they live in Jerusalem and there and it took us one minute without solving this issue who has [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3201.54s)]
*  more rights yeah and then we had another discussion and after two meetings we said okay it's not about [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3208.34s)]
*  whose narrative is more just and we drafted the last article of the peace treaty that never signed [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3215.3s)]
*  and the last article said that both sides can keep their own narratives and believe but we decide [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3222.7400000000002s)]
*  to uh work or to divide what I believe is the land of Israel he believes is Palestine [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3230.98s)]
*  and to create a better future so the discussion about rights is the wrong one the right discussion [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3237.62s)]
*  is about what we are doing in order to you know when I'm thinking about it he said let's create [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3245.14s)]
*  a better future for my grandchildren and I said to my children and now I have grandchildren as well [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3253.62s)]
*  and time passed by and we didn't solve this issue but this is the last we have we already have the [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3260.9s)]
*  last article of the agreement that we are not implementing our rights yeah and and this is the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3267.06s)]
*  most important thing yeah so so I'm going to start asking people to think about their questions and [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3275.78s)]
*  to raise your hand if your hand is raised then I will call on you unmute you and you can ask a [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3282.1800000000003s)]
*  question okay I okay no I'm sorry I'm just we were speaking about the idea is not giving up [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3288.02s)]
*  rights yeah but not these are my beliefs and this is part of my history yeah but I need to make a [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3295.54s)]
*  decision for generations to come yeah yeah I totally hear you I mean my my my strong feeling [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3303.06s)]
*  has been that one thing that is this was actually uh suggested to me by a student of mine so it's [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3310.5s)]
*  not an Israeli student of mine so it's not an original insight of mine but that one of the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3316.98s)]
*  steps forward has to be each side recognizing the other's right to the entire land so the [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3321.78s)]
*  Palestinian saying I recognize that you have a right to the whole thing from the river to the sea [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3329.38s)]
*  and the Israelis saying to the Palestinian I recognize that you have a right to the whole [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3334.18s)]
*  thing to that river to the recognition the recognition is different the recognition [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3338.66s)]
*  is recognizing the state of recognizing the rights of the Jewish people for a state in this land [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3344.4199999999996s)]
*  and vice versa yeah but uh it's about living with my narrative and my history and my rights but [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3352.2599999999998s)]
*  making a decision yeah I mean I'm I despair of us ever getting to that point anyways because you [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3360.74s)]
*  know you you just talked about the denial of October 7th which is a real phenomenon a very [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3366.58s)]
*  distressing phenomenon but for me what has also been equally distressing is the denial of uh what's [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3373.54s)]
*  happening to the Palestinians I mean you can see all every time that there would be a report of [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3380.5s)]
*  mass civilian casualty in Gaza you would find those who would try to cast doubt on it and say [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3387.54s)]
*  it didn't happen and I part part of what I think is so difficult about this conflict is that [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3394.42s)]
*  each side doesn't want to acknowledge not just the rights of the other side but the suffering of [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3400.82s)]
*  the other side um there's there's a lot but we shouldn't turn a blind eye to facts these are the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3406.82s)]
*  facts what's happening here what's happening there and then we should decide what do you feel [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3413.78s)]
*  toward it what is our judgment what are we doing with it we have a lot of hands up and uh those [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3419.3s)]
*  the bearers of those hands would be very unhappy with me if I continued asking you questions but [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3427.46s)]
*  I have to you know there's things to ask about Syria etc I won't ask any of that hoping that our [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3432.1800000000003s)]
*  audience will but I do want to just ask you one last uh question and that's about you know the [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3436.9s)]
*  result of the recent election you know we have Trump uh uh President Trump uh coming back in [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3443.22s)]
*  and you know I want you to actually I don't want to ask you what do you think this will will [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3449.7s)]
*  portend for Israel that's too open-ended question but I want to get your take on an argument so [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3455.46s)]
*  President Trump said after October 7th he said this would never have happened if I were in charge [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3461.94s)]
*  the Iranians would have been squeezed they wouldn't have had the money to give to Hamas so that it [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3467.86s)]
*  and to Hezbollah so that they could mount uh this operation other people however say that no [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3472.5s)]
*  October 7th happened because Trump was in charge because he and Jared Kushner spent four years [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3478.98s)]
*  basically ignoring the Palestinians handing them defeat after defeat um and leaving them no choice [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3487.2200000000003s)]
*  but this kind of violence um which of these two views about the Trump administration is right that [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3493.86s)]
*  Trump would have October 7th would never have happened or actually Trump's policies made [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3500.9s)]
*  October 7th more likely uh you offered two options uh no no uh but um you know it's very [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3506.1800000000003s)]
*  hypothetical but uh there is one thing that I would not accept whether it is connected to Trump or not [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3517.14s)]
*  because the other option is justifying or understanding in a wrong manner what happened [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3523.7s)]
*  and why this has happened what happened Hamas is not because what Hamas did is not connected to [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3531.46s)]
*  the occupation that exists in West in in this thing this is not connected to this at all and [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3540.42s)]
*  therefore they would not change their ideology they would never accept well they would accept [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3548.5s)]
*  the Palestinians but not accept our right I'm repeating myself and therefore I cannot accept [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3554.66s)]
*  those suggesting that Trump caused it because ignore the Palestinians but I do believe I do [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3560.1s)]
*  believe that an American president who supports the idea of two states who took place is not anti [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3566.9s)]
*  Israel uh because I believe that this is an Israeli interest uh and uh frankly Abraham [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3572.1s)]
*  accords was I was surprised uh it's a huge uh change it's it's really a new middle east [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3579.62s)]
*  uh but nevertheless I I do believe that I'm like you know the rado saying okay now if the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3588.2599999999998s)]
*  arab is making peace normalizes relations with Israel without the Palestinians so it's good and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3595.86s)]
*  I'm saying no we are living here in this tiny place between the river and the sea with the [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3601.14s)]
*  Palestinians uh we need uh to solve this issue but I'm very happy and I think that it was [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3605.8599999999997s)]
*  really uh wow uh it was a huge step toward uh really a new middle east and uh it is [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3613.54s)]
*  frankly you said that uh you interviewed Jared Kushner so he deserves all the credit for this [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3624.66s)]
*  yeah all right I'm now going to call on members of our audience so the first hand I have up [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3630.26s)]
*  belongs to somebody I believe you know uh ambassador Edward uh Jurijian no of course [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3638.02s)]
*  please go ahead sir your excellency Livni it's so good to see you and I'm so glad that Tarik [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3646.5s)]
*  has invited you I commend you for your all the past work you've done in negotiating [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3653.2200000000003s)]
*  with the Palestinians and the Arabs uh and I think you represent uh a real hope for the state [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3659.2200000000003s)]
*  of Israel living in peace and security with its Arab neighbors in the future uh let me just pick [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3665.38s)]
*  up on your conversation with Tarik my definition of between the river and the sea is a very simple [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3672.34s)]
*  one it's a very demographic one it's that basically between the river and the sea there are approximately [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3679.46s)]
*  7.2 million Palestinian Arabs and 7.2 million Israeli Jews living there and neither one is [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3684.58s)]
*  going to go anywhere uh even neither one of the extremist group really extremists who want a [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3691.14s)]
*  greater Israel and annex Judean Samaria or Hamas who wants to eliminate the state of Israel uh they [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3699.46s)]
*  they have an impossible task in front of them neither one can succeed in eliminating the other [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3706.8199999999997s)]
*  so the issue is as you both have pointed out land for peace I criticized the Abraham Accords [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3712.82s)]
*  because I think they marginalized the land for peace equation and strove too much for [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3720.26s)]
*  peace to peace and economic peace after October 7th we see that the price of normalization [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3724.98s)]
*  of Arab countries especially Saudi Arabia has risen uh very high that there has to be not only [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3731.7000000000003s)]
*  credible states but something leading to an independent Palestinian state living in peace [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3738.9s)]
*  and security next to Israel so my question my question is given your your role in the opposition [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3743.3s)]
*  uh is it possible for the Israeli body politic which I think has moved to the right is it possible [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3753.86s)]
*  for there to be new elections and new elections in Palestine that will bring credible leadership [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3760.98s)]
*  to the floor that can take these steps that you've outlined toward a two-state solution [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3769.06s)]
*  okay I agree with you of course about the situation nobody's uh we are going to stay there [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3780.18s)]
*  and therefore I would like to have in a way divorce uh in an understanding that [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3787.86s)]
*  if we would not separate ourselves or do something we will have this ongoing conflict between in this [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3796.26s)]
*  tiny place unlike you I was quite happy uh more than happy with the normalization although yes [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3804.02s)]
*  the decision at the time was to not to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict unlike the Saudis [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3811.3s)]
*  that was willing that were willing to do so before October 7th and uh now the threshold is higher [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3817.22s)]
*  and I don't know whether their minimum is uh will meet an Netanyahu's maximum or this government [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3824.58s)]
*  maximum uh in connection to the conflict but as I said before I believe that this is an Israeli [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3832.2599999999998s)]
*  leadership now another thing that is important to say also to Israelis uh speaking openly [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3838.4199999999996s)]
*  the conflict was not uh on the political Israeli table before October 7th we had five rounds of [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3847.3799999999997s)]
*  elections everything was on the table but nobody spoke about this and right now after October 7th [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3854.5s)]
*  uh less and less also in the opposition are willing to speak about it speaking uh openly [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3863.22s)]
*  and I believe that this is a mistake because I believe that also I understand the feeling [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3869.14s)]
*  the feeling of Israelis not trusting about the Palestinians all these horrors but they are [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3875.62s)]
*  reaching the wrong conclusion because it's now clear the price of that civilians are uh paid [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3884.02s)]
*  on the border so the idea that some within this government are throwing of resettlement in Gaza [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3893.7s)]
*  which will not happen but this is just sending more civilians it's against it's it's it's against [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3900.5s)]
*  it's it's against the idea of of uh separating yourself or divorcing now what need to to be [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3908.18s)]
*  understand also you know I grew up based on Jabotinsky uh a mentor Zionist mentor the vote in [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3918.18s)]
*  1920 something about that is where the future uh Jewish state should build an iron wall [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3924.74s)]
*  the idea it was about sending a message to the neighbors to the Arabs that they cannot that we [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3932.8199999999997s)]
*  are they're here to stay so we've built this iron wall and now it's time to enter as he also wrote [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3940.1s)]
*  at the time when when they will be certain that they cannot kick us or kill us then we can enter [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3947.7799999999997s)]
*  the negotiations room and I think that this should be also understood by the Israeli side [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3954.02s)]
*  so what I'm saying to Israelis is the following and I'm using the example that I've shared before [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3959.78s)]
*  about our national race okay we are moving to this direction uh Jewish democratic secured state uh [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3965.94s)]
*  hopefully when we are moving forward we find a station where we can stop and find a partner [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3974.2599999999998s)]
*  on the other side but even if there is no partner for now on the other side and unfortunately [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3980.66s)]
*  it looks that on both sides there are no partners for you know comprehensive peace treaty what [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3987.46s)]
*  we need to do is not to change our destination or not to change the road but you know traffic [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=3994.74s)]
*  jam so we would find other uh roads to reach the same destination we would wait but we will not [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4001.62s)]
*  make steps that would uh make it impossible or difficult for us to reach this destination in the [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4008.18s)]
*  future therefore I'm against expanding of settlements activities and so on and there are [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4017.54s)]
*  certain steps that we can do that would ease or make it more easy in the future to reach this [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4022.8999999999996s)]
*  agreement it's not about reaching an agreement today but it's about keeping the road open [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4029.8599999999997s)]
*  yeah uh you know just as a follow-up to the ambassador's excellent question your excellent [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4035.7799999999997s)]
*  response I mean one could infer from what you said that you know there's a role for the United [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4040.74s)]
*  States here that the United States can help Israel by being tough on any Israeli government [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4047.14s)]
*  that wants to do things like expand settlements that consequently make a lasting peace so much [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4054.02s)]
*  more difficult to achieve so it might be in your country's interest to have an American administration [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4061.14s)]
*  that says no to Israel uh quite loudly and quite often in order to get uh the country's leaders to [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4068.1s)]
*  actually actually act in ways that are consistent with the national interest of views of views laid [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4076.18s)]
*  it out so you don't want I believe in leadership in Israel that will not need somebody from the [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4081.22s)]
*  outside to force it to do the right thing but yes I'm afraid or I'm worried if the current Israeli [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4088.18s)]
*  government will get a blank check to do what the or to annexation for example this is completely [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4097.3s)]
*  against the Israeli interest that I see okay uh the next hand that I have up is from uh Barack Sala [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4102.74s)]
*  so go ahead Barack [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4112.34s)]
*  um so I'm a student and a fellow at the Middle East Initiative and Ms. Ligny grew up in our [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4119.14s)]
*  right-wing ideological home um and the Likud was a much more liberal party than it was [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4126.58s)]
*  today um and today you're being attacked sometimes as being leftist and your name was even floated [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4134.02s)]
*  around for Yairi Golan's new political party it's very rare that we see you know politicians change [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4139.700000000001s)]
*  their views and at a time where many in Israel as Professor Masoud say there is a shift to the right [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4147.38s)]
*  if you can speak to what would be needed uh not only for politicians but for the general public [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4156.18s)]
*  to try and look at the reality from a different perspective we know you know we see the rise of [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4163.78s)]
*  support for even settlements resurgence in Gaza and even a fringe movement talking about settlements [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4168.820000000001s)]
*  in Lebanon how can we count this movement to the right in Israel and if she would speak from your [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4176.74s)]
*  experience as someone who's done it personally and led movements in this direction uh yes thank you [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4185.139999999999s)]
*  yes I I grew up as I said before both my parents lived in greater Israel uh but yet you know when [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4192.0199999999995s)]
*  I joined politics and I will start talking about Palestinian states or my mother and here she is [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4199.54s)]
*  uh that's a picture uh once called me and I was um and she said but Sibir I listen to you [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4205.38s)]
*  it hurts me but we fought for the establishment of of of the country and I see young people living [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4213.78s)]
*  to America so now it's your turn to make the right decisions and and I believe that we live in a world [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4220.82s)]
*  of images and perceptions and the Israel when you say right being for Israelis it means security [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4230.5s)]
*  but it's not I mean security is a necessity all uh parts of of Israel political arena should bring [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4237.860000000001s)]
*  security to Israel but how this I I share with Israelis exactly what I've shown with you you need [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4246.02s)]
*  to choose do you support and you know I was quite optimistic during the uh demonstrations [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4253.14s)]
*  against the judicial reform because Israel for the first time after many years it was not just [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4261.06s)]
*  anybody but Netanyahu or only Netanyahu but they fought for for values for equality for democracy [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4267.22s)]
*  and for me it was clear that if you believe in democracy then you need to understand that we [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4273.9400000000005s)]
*  cannot keep one state with all these millions of Palestinians without rights so Israel would need [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4278.9s)]
*  to choose between being a Jewish or democratic state and the year choice the Israeli choice is [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4287.0599999999995s)]
*  not between security or peace it's between uh what I represented right now or greater Israel with no [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4293.62s)]
*  peace with the non-going conflict religious national and some of the extremists uh within [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4303.22s)]
*  the Israeli society and politics are turning it also into a religious conflict and settlements [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4308.9800000000005s)]
*  that do not help Israel's security it's the role of the army not of civilians that we are sending [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4316.26s)]
*  and therefore well it's a long debate that maybe you should do it in Israel and not at Harvard now [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4323.62s)]
*  but but uh I believe that this is so important this is the real discussion [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4330.58s)]
*  that Israel needs to have now and it's not going and and it's not it's not being discussed in Israel [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4340.82s)]
*  as it should unfortunately yeah um the the next question I have is from uh Yusef Shahid so I am [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4347.46s)]
*  uh please go ahead your excellency thank you professor Masoud uh listening to this rich debate [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4356.339999999999s)]
*  one realizes the importance of peace opportunities that were missing uh for the region during history [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4365.0599999999995s)]
*  the fact is that today neither Israel nor the Palestinian have a peace plan or a vision for a [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4372.74s)]
*  peace plan as it was before and you you are probably the last minister to have led and negotiated [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4379.62s)]
*  serious peace plan so there was certainly the Abrahamic Accord but the attack of October 7th [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4385.54s)]
*  showed as ambassador just mentioned that there will be no peace without the resolution of the [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4391.7s)]
*  Palestinian issue so my question here is given what has just been said and knowing that the [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4396.74s)]
*  seventh of October created more radicalization in the region or knowing that the condition and [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4403.62s)]
*  parameters of peace are clearly not met today how do you see the future of the Israeli-Palestinian [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4409.14s)]
*  conflict I'm not talking about the solution you recommend which we understand to be for peace and [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4416.42s)]
*  for two-state solution but about the most likely situation you expect to be on the ground in the [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4421.46s)]
*  coming years given today given the situation of the Palestinian leadership and more globally given [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4427.62s)]
*  the prevailing trends that we see in the region well I agree with you that it's a matter of [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4434.58s)]
*  leadership I believe that it's the role of leadership to show the people what is the right [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4441.38s)]
*  direction and unfortunately on both sides this is not happening right now when you are speaking [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4446.58s)]
*  about more radicalization in the region but but after a year or more than a year what we see is [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4453.7s)]
*  that the radical forces are losing the radical jihadists the extremists they are losing in a way [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4459.7s)]
*  their power and therefore that's a great opportunity for the right leaders to take the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4468.179999999999s)]
*  right decisions and and therefore since I as I said before I don't believe that there is peace [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4474.42s)]
*  around the corner you know just give bring me one Palestinian and we'll solve it I've tried frankly [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4479.62s)]
*  but it's a matter of steps forward and what I'm saying to Israelis is that the real question is [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4486.42s)]
*  not whether we have a Palestinian partner right now or not and frankly we don't have one right now [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4493.62s)]
*  but it's about let's not forget where we are heading and what we would like to achieve in [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4498.82s)]
*  the future and let's keep this road over and I hope also that the Palestinians would would [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4503.46s)]
*  understand that this is the best way for them because they are also as we all see [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4508.9s)]
*  are paying the price so the reason opportunity I would suggest to start with these small steps [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4516.42s)]
*  in in Gaza but as part of a broader plan for the future and I agree that there are those that are [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4523.46s)]
*  exploiting the area marked according to say you see we can have peaceful peace or [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4535.14s)]
*  just economic peace without paying the price but it's not the same we didn't have real conflict [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4541.54s)]
*  with these countries while as was said before millions of Israelis and Palestinians are living [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4547.780000000001s)]
*  together and it won't work in one state both sides will not express their national aspiration [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4554.5s)]
*  if this will move forward and so let's my suggestion is to start with Gaza and to take [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4563.620000000001s)]
*  steps forward without forgetting where we are heading or by saying where we are heading [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4574.34s)]
*  both together. You know Your Excellency you said something in response to Dr Yusef Shahid's [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4579.780000000001s)]
*  question you said that the extremists are losing or they're becoming less popular [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4587.860000000001s)]
*  and I hope you're right. I have yeah my concern is that it's the exact opposite actually in that [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4595.62s)]
*  particularly what's happening now in Gaza and the very dramatic and quite disturbing images that [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4603.46s)]
*  flood Arab television screens every single day are actually increasing support not just for [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4610.42s)]
*  Hamas but for the extremists who claim to be the ones who will resist Israel's occupation and [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4616.66s)]
*  okay I will not argue this I when I said that actually I referred to as was mentioned before [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4627.139999999999s)]
*  that it looks like all these Shia exes Iran and Syria and Hezbollah is turning into something else [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4633.78s)]
*  Hamas lost its power or terrorist infrastructure in Gaza so there is no opportunity here [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4640.5s)]
*  and the question is where will it take us I'm not turning a blind eye to the streets in different [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4649.78s)]
*  Arab countries but as I said before there's an info leadership on all these countries. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4657.86s)]
*  Or frankly future generations of Gazans you know that you know one might also expect that if you [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4663.78s)]
*  are a Gazan growing up at this time when your you know homeland has been subject to this very [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4671.78s)]
*  you know devastating military campaign that that is not a recipe for the creation of moderates. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4680.66s)]
*  Okay let me get more questions in the next question I have is from Dr. Sophia Goodfriend [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4686.9s)]
*  so please go ahead Dr. Goodfriend. Thank you so much for speaking today I wanted to ask you [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4695.54s)]
*  about a domestic issue that I suppose follows up on Barack's question you as you said you're [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4702.259999999999s)]
*  a really outspoken critic of Netanyahu you've testified in court against him and critics say [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4707.62s)]
*  that you know Netanyahu's rule since coming back into power a few years ago has been marked by [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4713.7s)]
*  really a systemic dismantling of Israeli democratic institutions this happened you know before October [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4718.58s)]
*  7th with the protests that we were referencing to earlier but some say he has also leveraged the war [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4724.58s)]
*  to push through a controversial legislation that really attacks Israeli institutions even more [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4730.82s)]
*  not only you know supporting the judicial reforms but attacking the press restricting [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4736.66s)]
*  freedom of speech and freedom of protest the list kind of goes on so I my question is is is quite [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4740.5s)]
*  simple I wonder really you know can you talk a little bit about do you believe that there is a [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4746.58s)]
*  democratic Israeli state right now to speak of to what extent is it under attack and what is needed [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4750.9s)]
*  to protect Israeli democracy at this point? Oh yes Israel is a democracy and the judicial institutions [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4756.66s)]
*  are still standing strong but they are under attack and it's not just about legislation [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4766.02s)]
*  we used to think about what was called the judicial reform as legislation passing in the [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4774.740000000001s)]
*  parliament in the Knesset but this is not even the situation anymore I mean the minister of [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4780.26s)]
*  internal security Ben Brewer is doing things that were unacceptable in the past [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4786.820000000001s)]
*  are becoming you know the obvious of ministers that are interfering within decisions [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4794.42s)]
*  by the police and so on but yet and of course attacking the press you've mentioned all [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4801.46s)]
*  the lists that this is what Netanyahu and Netanyahu's government are doing but yet I think that [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4809.7s)]
*  that since Israel is democracy what we are doing not in the official opposition but what we are [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4818.58s)]
*  doing is that Chris is trying to take the streets again although during the war people felt you know [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4826.18s)]
*  it takes us back to the beginning of the conversation when you are worried about your son [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4833.78s)]
*  that is in the army and the state of the country and the mere existence of your country so you're [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4838.5s)]
*  less focused on this issue but now when it looks that we truly are in a different position and [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4844.5s)]
*  even in Gaza the situation is less dramatic but hopefully the hostages will be back so that's [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4852.42s)]
*  that's really the time to to continue not to apologize and to put on the table [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4858.9s)]
*  and I believe that it is connected it is connected because those believing in democracy [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4868.42s)]
*  is not just about judicial reforms or the state of the supreme court what we have on the other side [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4873.54s)]
*  I will elaborate a bit when I was speaking about those that are taking the car or taking Israel to [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4880.98s)]
*  another direction what they they share the same vision it's not just about the land of Israel [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4886.74s)]
*  they don't believe in democracy because the religious or orthodox for them equality for [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4895.14s)]
*  women or gtb is unacceptable and there are those messianic groups that for them equality for our [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4899.94s)]
*  Arabs is not acceptable on top of this you have the prime minister who's being charged in court [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4906.419999999999s)]
*  so altogether everything is connected and also the conflict is connected to that so what needs [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4913.54s)]
*  to be done to continue in in fighting and speaking and taking the streets [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4920.179999999999s)]
*  there is no other solution because of them at the end the opposition has less fingers less votes [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4925.14s)]
*  in the parliament so it doesn't look like they would win in non-conflict as for but but just [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4935.06s)]
*  one sentence it's important for me that Israelis would understand that there is another way forward [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4943.780000000001s)]
*  that it is connected not only to what they are doing to the judicial institutions or law [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4954.26s)]
*  enforcement but also in connection to the conflict it is connected because when you are losing this [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4960.42s)]
*  this will happen in the west bank it will happen to us as well yeah it's it's there's so much more [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4968.820000000001s)]
*  to talk about here with respect to Israel's democracy which is quite a you know almost a [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4975.14s)]
*  miraculous thing that this country has been one of the sole democracies in the region for a very [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4982.42s)]
*  long time however at the moment it feels like in Israel democracy isn't really the answer for the [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4988.26s)]
*  reason that you just described your excellency which is that a huge swath of the Israeli [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JTCJG_37Y&t=4995.86s)]
