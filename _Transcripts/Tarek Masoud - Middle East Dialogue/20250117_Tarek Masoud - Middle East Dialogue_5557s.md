# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with Bret Stephens
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o)
*  All right. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the sixth and final installment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Middle East dialogues. This is a series of conversations that we have been holding [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=11.34s)]
*  with people who hold wildly varied, but important and widely shared perspectives about the conflict [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=17.12s)]
*  in Israel and Palestine, its causes, and how it might be brought to an end. In this series, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=24.84s)]
*  we have hosted everybody from Jared Kushner to former Bernie Sanders advisor Matt Duss [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=31.48s)]
*  to the Palestinian academic Delel Erekat to the former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=38.28s)]
*  Fayyad and the former member of the Israeli Knesset, Dr. Anat Wilf. And all of them said [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  things that were difficult for people to hear, but I think always illuminating for those of us [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=50.64s)]
*  who are searching for answers as to how we can achieve a more peaceful future for the people of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=62.24s)]
*  this very troubled region. Our guest today in this last of our Middle East dialogues, and you are not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=70.0s)]
*  detecting a note of relief when I say last, is Brett Stevens. Brett is a columnist for the New [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=77.12s)]
*  York Times. He's a former editor and columnist at the Wall Street Journal where he won a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=84.84s)]
*  He's the former editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post and the founding editor of Sapir, which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=90.04s)]
*  bills itself a quote, quarterly journal of ideas for a thriving Jewish future. Mr. Stevens and I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  are going to talk for 45 minutes to an hour after which we will open it up to questions. There's a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=103.96s)]
*  couple of things that I should note before we begin. Those of you who've been to this know that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=111.72s)]
*  if you do ask a question, the event is being recorded and so you are thereby consenting to have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  your voice and visage beamed across the galaxy and recorded for all posterity. I'm also supposed to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  say something about disruptions and how we'll handle them, but this is a crowd. I can just look at all [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  your faces and I know that you are all people of sterling character and so I'm not worried about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=137.24s)]
*  that. So let's get started. Please join me in welcoming Brett Stevens. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for coming, sir. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=154.68s)]
*  Pleasure to be here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=155.88s)]
*  So let's just dive right in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=157.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=158.52s)]
*  We are now seven months past October 7th when Hamas murdered more than 1200 Israelis, more than [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=159.0s)]
*  two-thirds of whom were civilians and took more than 200 people hostages. The hostages at this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=167.8s)]
*  point have been returned. Hamas has not been destroyed, but more than 30,000 Palestinians [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=174.52s)]
*  have been killed in the Gaza Strip and that territory, which was never a paradise to begin [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=180.6s)]
*  with, has now been rendered a shattered wasteland. It's April 29th. There are reports that a ceasefire [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=187.24s)]
*  agreement may be imminent. Are you as happy about that as I am? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=194.84s)]
*  Well, it depends on what the agreement is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=199.88s)]
*  What could make you happy about a ceasefire agreement? What ceasefire agreement would you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=203.08s)]
*  be satisfied with? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, this is at least the fifth war that Israel has fought with Hamas since Hamas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=209.56s)]
*  forcibly seized the territory by throwing its political rivals out the window literally in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=217.4s)]
*  2007. And each of those conflicts has ended with a ceasefire only to be repeated again. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=226.6s)]
*  So a conflict that leads to a ceasefire but does so in a way that all but guarantees a future [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  conflict on a scale similar to this does not strike me as a good outcome. A good outcome is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=241.8s)]
*  one that permanently changes the status quo in Gaza. And the only way in which I see that happening [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=249.4s)]
*  is for Hamas to be meaningfully defeated and evicted as the reigning political and military [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=256.84s)]
*  power in the Strip. Otherwise, we're going to be having this conversation in four or five years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=266.28s)]
*  with new tragedies visited on Israelis and Palestinians and an even higher cumulative [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  death toll. So the idea of ceasefire now, as attractive in many ways as it is, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=281.24s)]
*  and I mean that in all sincerity, is a recipe for a new tragedy a few years down the road. And [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=289.32s)]
*  again, I say this because this is a movie that we're not seeing for the first time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=299.0s)]
*  In your narration of this film, you've got Hamas, which in your... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=305.16s)]
*  Can I interrupt you for one second? You mentioned that the Palestinian death toll, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  and I think it's important. We do not ordinarily treat, for instance, casualty figures that come [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=315.48s)]
*  to us from the Russian government at face value. Because we assume that the Russian government is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  probably lying for propagandistic purposes about what their fatality rate is, either undercounting [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=331.72s)]
*  or overcounting one way or the other. I'm actually shocked by the willingness to simply accept a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=338.44s)]
*  number that is produced by what is euphemistically called the Gazan Health Ministry, but it's in fact [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=344.12s)]
*  Hamas. So then the question has to be, well, does Hamas have an interest in minimizing the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=350.68s)]
*  number of casualties or in maximizing the number of casualties? The figure. Now, the answer, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=356.44s)]
*  I think the appropriate answer is, I don't think any of us knows what the casualty figure is. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=364.52s)]
*  What do you think it is? I don't know. It could be higher. It could be lower. I don't know. But I [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  don't like the automatic assumption that because Hamas has said something, an organization that has [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  actually a real interest in inflating some of these numbers, that we at an institution like this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=380.44s)]
*  should just accept it without at least some kind of challenge. I think you're right in general that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=387.0s)]
*  skepticism of any figure that's rendered to us is quite warranted. The reason I'm not terribly [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=392.36s)]
*  skeptical of this figure is I can see the pictures, right? I mean, Gaza is completely flattened, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  and I believe the Israelis, when the Israelis say the problem with Hamas is that they hide among [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  civilians. So it seems eminently reasonable to me that a lot of civilians would die. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  Why can't we just say accurately, a lot of civilians are dead. We don't know what the number is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=414.12s)]
*  What's the problem with saying that the best death, because here's the other point you're not [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=419.32s)]
*  letting me make, Brett, which is that in previous conflicts, Hamas's numbers, the Gaza health [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=422.76s)]
*  authorities, whatever you want to call that body, their numbers have basically been validated. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=429.0s)]
*  No. Including by the Israelis. No, they haven't. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=433.16s)]
*  They have been challenged, including by doctors at Al-Shifa. And I'm just simply saying this. I'm [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=437.88s)]
*  not trying to say that there haven't been terrible Palestinian casualties. I'm simply saying that it [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=442.76s)]
*  behooves us, okay, if we're going to be serious to say that a terrorist organization with a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=447.64s)]
*  propagandistic interest in inflating numbers should be at least treated with the same kind [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=452.68s)]
*  of skepticism with which we treat numbers that come out of, say, the Russian Ministry of Defense. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=458.52s)]
*  I think you're right that we should be skeptical of any numbers. However, again, because this number [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  comports with the physical reality that we're observing. No, it does not. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=470.76s)]
*  I mean, the territory is completely fine. It could be then it could be- [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=475.64s)]
*  They're dropping 2,000 pounds on these people. Then it could be many times that number for all [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=479.0s)]
*  we know, okay? What you're doing is you're simply taking a number and accepting it at face value. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  You know who said that to me also? Every time I mention 1,200 Israelis killed, people on the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=488.28s)]
*  other side will say to me, Tarek, you're taking a number at face value. Let's get past the argument [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=493.24s)]
*  about the number. And by the way, no numbers should be taken at face value. But if we are [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  going to challenge the Israeli numbers, which I think actually were fairly methodical, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=503.56s)]
*  right, then at a minimum, we should ask questions about what the Palestinian- [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=507.8s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm not challenging the Israeli numbers. And I think you would not challenge the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=511.56s)]
*  underlying fact that was behind my question, which is that the situation in Gaza is absolutely [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=517.24s)]
*  monstrous. It's terrible. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=524.12s)]
*  It's terrible. And so, you know, we were talking about, you know, you have a narrative about why [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=525.48s)]
*  it's terrible. And I think I agree with a big chunk of that narrative, which is that, you know, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=530.68s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization that was never interested in the welfare of the people of Gaza. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=535.2399999999999s)]
*  Okay. Now, when did you learn that fact about Hamas? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  Maybe the first time I interviewed a Hamas leader in 2000. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=548.04s)]
*  In 2000. So you have known that fact for 24 years. Do you think that anybody who knows [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=550.92s)]
*  anything about the Middle East or who has two brain cells to rub together would not have known [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=555.88s)]
*  that fact? Well, I think there's some students here who by now- [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=560.6s)]
*  Possibly. Let's leave our students out of it. Okay. But here's the point. Here's the point. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=563.48s)]
*  Our students are great. Here's the point. Some students, not in this room. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=568.76s)]
*  You and I agree. You and I agree about Hamas. But somebody who clearly does not seem to have gotten [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=572.44s)]
*  the memo is Benjamin Netanyahu, who you yourself have written. What was the language that you [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  used? You said he had a disastrous policy of engagement with Hamas prior to October 7th. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=586.2800000000001s)]
*  And the people of Israel paid the price for that because he was channeling the money, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=593.24s)]
*  thinking that the way that you prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state is to keep [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  the Palestinians divided. And to keep the Palestinians divided, you have to keep funding [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  Hamas. So Israelis paid the price for that on October 7th. Why should Palestinians pay the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  price for that? Palestinians should pay no price. They are, though. Okay. But the reason [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=613.16s)]
*  they are paying the price- look, let me just rewind a second. This came about for a series [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=620.6s)]
*  of dreadful reasons that could carry us back into the- if not the dawn of time, at least the dawn of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=628.76s)]
*  most of our lifetimes. Okay? The problem that you have is that Hamas has with sometimes the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=636.52s)]
*  complicity, sometimes the opposition of the people in Gaza. I think it's a mixture of the two. And [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=645.96s)]
*  it's very difficult to disentangle what support means in an autocratic or almost totalitarian [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=652.12s)]
*  society like Gaza under Hamas. Hamas has made Gaza a base to terrorize with the aim of eliminating [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=657.56s)]
*  its neighboring sovereign state. And so any Israeli government, any government has a moral [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=671.0s)]
*  responsibility to make sure that its people cannot be put at the kind of mortal and terrifying risk [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=683.72s)]
*  that Hamas creates. And that too many Israelis, and I would add the entire international community, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=694.84s)]
*  quite frankly, it wasn't just Netanyahu, indulged for too long. I think things might be very [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=703.0s)]
*  different if there were international pressure to say a ceasefire happens when Hamas surrenders. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=710.76s)]
*  Right? A ceasefire- this conflict ends when this terrorist organization, which has embedded itself [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  not only, I would say barbarically, in a civilian population surrenders its leaders, releases its [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=722.36s)]
*  hostages, and one way or another goes away. And then you might have something like a much better [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=733.8s)]
*  outcome in Gaza that has a sustainable future. Look, honestly, if I could wave a magic wand and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=739.72s)]
*  have Hamas leaders agree to leave the territory or commit harry-carrie, I would wave that magic [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=745.88s)]
*  wand immediately. But I just want- right now we're not in that situation. And we're in a situation [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=751.64s)]
*  where these people are deeply entrenched, they're hiding underground, and the Israelis, in order to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=757.0s)]
*  get to them, are pursuing a policy that is resulting in massive human casualties. And I guess [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=762.36s)]
*  what I'm trying to get you to help me understand is why is that legitimate given that the whole [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=769.0s)]
*  reason that Hamas is entrenched is in large part because of Netanyahu's cynical- [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=777.64s)]
*  In the summer- let me make one last point and then you can demolish me. In the summer before [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=783.64s)]
*  October 7th, Gazans were actually protesting Hamas and protesting its mismanagement. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=789.8s)]
*  Those protests would have probably been much bigger and come a lot sooner had Netanyahu not [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=796.28s)]
*  been relaxing Hamas's budget constraint. Look, Netanyahu bears a burden of blame for a policy [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  that was essentially had the blessing of the entire western world. I don't remember anyone in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=810.92s)]
*  the Biden administration saying- or the Trump administration before that, or the Obama administration [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=818.76s)]
*  before then and so on- saying, what are you doing, Bibi? You have to eliminate Hamas at all costs. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=824.04s)]
*  On the contrary, it was previous administrations that were constantly pressing the ceasefire option [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=831.8s)]
*  on Israel during previous rounds of fighting in 2014, 2018, 2012, 2008, and 2009. So Bibi's policy, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=836.68s)]
*  which I think was wrongheaded and history will condemn, justice history I think will condemn [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=847.48s)]
*  him personally for numerous sins, was part of a general policy of appeasement that was [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  in the west and as well as in the east. It was a universal policy that the best approach to Hamas's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  reign in Gaza was just to hope that they became nicer terrorists. That was the attitude. Let them [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=869.88s)]
*  have economic development and we'll have a kind of understanding and every so often they'll blow off [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  steam with some rockets and we'll have a week's worth of fighting and that'll be that. That was [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=881.08s)]
*  essentially the policy. But they're not obviously- I mean it's like saying that the problem with [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=886.0400000000001s)]
*  Nazi Germany was Chamberlain's appeasement. It was a problem with the rise of Nazi Germany, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=890.9200000000001s)]
*  but the heart of the problem lied with the fact that a totalitarian organization seized control [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=895.88s)]
*  of a territory, entrenched itself in the population, won over some portion of the population, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=903.0s)]
*  and decided to dedicate itself to a war of extermination and elimination against its [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=908.04s)]
*  neighbors. At some point that had to end. You and I are not going to disagree about the nature of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=913.0s)]
*  Hamas, but there's another way of looking at this. The story of the Gaza Strip under Hamas doesn't [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=919.48s)]
*  start on October 7th or a year before October 7th. Once Hamas gets elected in 2006 and the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=929.72s)]
*  international community decides we are not going to deal with a Palestinian government that has [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=939.88s)]
*  representation of Hamas. The argument that you will get from people is that we could have been [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=946.28s)]
*  on a completely different historical trajectory if we had actually allowed Hamas, the Palestinian [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=954.84s)]
*  government that was led by Hamas, now almost 20 years ago, to actually govern that territory. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=962.52s)]
*  Instead what we did is we subjected them to a blockade. There's no airport. There's no sea port. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=968.2s)]
*  What do you expect these people to end up doing when you keep them under this complete quarantine? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=973.64s)]
*  So if Hamas had had fuller access to an open commerce and sea port, then the organization [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=981.48s)]
*  that ended up... They would have developed into a different kind of organization. The argument here [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=993.32s)]
*  would be that the Hamas that pulled off October 7th was not the same Hamas that existed 17 years [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=997.88s)]
*  ago. I mean this is almost like a story that the child could have been just such a nice kid, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1004.04s)]
*  but unfortunately he was led astray by mean parents who denied him... It's like saying to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1010.12s)]
*  some of the Columbine kids, if only they'd had fuller access to a larger arsenal, they might [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1020.04s)]
*  have moderated their desires to do harm. Hamas's charter, its founding charter going back to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1026.52s)]
*  the 1980s, is an explicitly eliminationist genocidal charter. I think we actually [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1035.08s)]
*  insult Hamas. We insult Hamas by saying, oh they could have been nice people, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1041.24s)]
*  but they were led to this terrible misbehavior by all of the restrictions that were put in place. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1047.72s)]
*  They have a conviction, and it's a conviction that requires a certain amount of respect. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1055.72s)]
*  And the conviction is that Israel needs to be eliminated. A conviction shared by the way by a [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1061.48s)]
*  frightening number of people in Western academia, as I learned the other day. That is their true [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1067.32s)]
*  belief, and they have said so a thousand times. This was what... When I was interviewing a Hamas [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1076.12s)]
*  leader in Gaza in 2000, he was quite explicit. In fact, one of the points I used to make is I [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1082.52s)]
*  actually appreciate interviewing Hamas because they're fairly honest about what it is that they [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1087.72s)]
*  want. If you talk to Fatah people, you never know if they're lying out through their teeth or what, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1091.8799999999999s)]
*  but Hamas, why? Because they have a moral belief. So the suggestion that we would have had a nice [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  Hamas if Israel hasn't... And Egypt, I might add, hadn't subjected Gaza to restrictions, I think is [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  a wishful thought. Egypt is definitely culpable in the blockade of Gaza. That's a very important [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1110.68s)]
*  point to make. No, but look, this argument isn't as insane as you make it sound. So all organizations [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  have people, particularly political parties in developing societies, have people who want to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  fight and people who want to be mayors. And the trajectory that a political party takes is [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1131.8s)]
*  contingent on the environment that they operate in. And so the hypothesis is that this organization [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1137.32s)]
*  would have developed the way that a lot of Islamist parties developed in the Muslim world when they [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1143.32s)]
*  were allowed to participate in politics. Their military wings sort of atrophy or people redirect [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1148.76s)]
*  their efforts to politics. And we have a little bit of evidence of this. In the Hamas case, you can [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1155.3999999999999s)]
*  look, for example, in 2010, there were very few rockets being fired. The Egyptians had kind of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1161.16s)]
*  started allowing things to get into Gaza. And consequently, the Gazans were doing things like [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1168.52s)]
*  building water parks. What are you talking about? I'm talking about history. Let me tell you one [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1173.3200000000002s)]
*  other point. Let me make one other point and then you can demolish me. So the other point that I [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1179.88s)]
*  want to make is you're absolutely right about Hamas's charter. Hamas's charter has elimination [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1184.52s)]
*  this language about Israel. And they have not exactly amended the charter, but they offered some [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1190.84s)]
*  new documents. Some people call it an amended charter. Some people call it an addendum, an [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1196.76s)]
*  appendix, you know, whatever, where they say, look, we're not happy with the Jewish state, et cetera. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1201.08s)]
*  However, because two states are the consensus of the Palestinian community, that's what we'll accept. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1207.1599999999999s)]
*  And so that to me seems like a favorable evolution. Hamas wanted economic development. They would not [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1216.1999999999998s)]
*  have built 450 miles of underground tunnels in a territory that's only slightly larger than [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1221.9599999999998s)]
*  Manhattan. Okay. There's more tunnel-age, if that's a word, I'll make it up right now. There's more [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1226.76s)]
*  tunnel-age in Gaza than there is in New York after a century. I mean, granted, the second average [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  tunnel is a smashing success, but that's another story. I don't know what that is, but [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1239.56s)]
*  a hundred-year project to build six miles of tunnels, but that's a topic for somewhere else [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1247.6399999999999s)]
*  in this school. 450 miles, okay? That means a lot of concrete, a lot of rebar, a lot of manpower. How [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1252.84s)]
*  many billions of dollars of well-meaning development assistance, okay, which Hamas got for the sake of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  building schools and greenhouses and all the things that could have turned Gaza into something [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1267.48s)]
*  like a productive or prosperous enclave, with a very nice stretch of beach, by the way, on the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1273.56s)]
*  Mediterranean, turned it into a fortress to rival what the Japanese built at Mount Suribachi in Iwo [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1281.56s)]
*  Jima, in fact, to exceed it in the Second World War. So that is, I would say, an indication of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1289.72s)]
*  Hamas' priorities of bread versus, butter versus guns. So, you know, the suggestion that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1296.36s)]
*  Hamas would have moderated its views if only there had been a nicer policy. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1306.36s)]
*  Behaved differently. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1310.9199999999998s)]
*  I can't look. Neither of us can prove this, right? But I think the evidence is fairly convincing that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1312.28s)]
*  an organization that says, we want to kill Jews, and by the way, we're going to take every ounce of [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1317.7199999999998s)]
*  economic assistance we get to build an impregnable fortress with a purpose, the primary purpose of [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1323.08s)]
*  killing Jews, but a secondary and related purpose of killing lots of Palestinians should be factor [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1328.36s)]
*  in the evidence here. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1334.52s)]
*  So, you know, again, but this just brings me back to the original question I asked you. Okay, Brett [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1335.72s)]
*  Stevens, you have totally convinced me, in which case I'm trying to understand why the Palestinian [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1340.28s)]
*  people have to pay the cost for this, given that you're talking about all the money that went to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1345.56s)]
*  Hamas, Netanyahu was funneling them that money. And so, again, we are in a situation now, I don't [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1349.96s)]
*  know if it's 13,000, 30,000, 60,000, Palestinians are getting hammered. Some of the rhetoric about [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1355.32s)]
*  the Palestinian people, including from, say, the Israeli president, that there's no such thing as a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1363.08s)]
*  Palestinian civilian, these people could have led an uprising against Hamas and they didn't. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1367.16s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't because Netanyahu was funneling the money and, you know, making it easier for [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1373.32s)]
*  them to govern. So, again, we're now in this situation. I guess I'm trying to make a much more [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1379.72s)]
*  serious moral philosopher than I am. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1384.04s)]
*  No, I'm not. But listen, this is, I think, the question. Look, I think we are agreed that both of us, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1385.96s)]
*  and I hope everyone in this room, wants an outcome for Palestinians that in three or five or ten [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1392.52s)]
*  years' time looks a hell of a lot better than it did in the last three or five or however many years. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1399.32s)]
*  That outcome is not possible without the elimination of Hamas as a military and political entity [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1405.4s)]
*  that can and will govern the enclave. I don't subscribe. There's a lot that Israeli ministers [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1414.52s)]
*  say that I think is wretched or stupid or some combination of the two. But I think Benny Gantz, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1421.56s)]
*  the defense minister, said something astute when he said that taking out 80 percent of Hamas or [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1427.4s)]
*  whatever the number is was like taking out 80 percent of a fire brigade going into the house and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1434.68s)]
*  getting rid of 80 percent of the fire. If you get rid of 80 percent of the fire, the 20 percent of [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1441.16s)]
*  the fire that remains will eventually engulf the house, right? It will destroy the house. If Hamas [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1445.16s)]
*  remains, say that we have a ceasefire now, okay, or ceasefire tomorrow, and Hamas remains as [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1451.8s)]
*  essentially the governing entity, knowing what we know about Hamas, there's no question that they [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1458.6s)]
*  will rapidly reestablish their authority throughout the territory. They will come out and wave a flag [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1464.36s)]
*  of victorious resistance. My colleague and friend Tom Friedman, whom I read with great respect, says [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1469.96s)]
*  on the day after they'll wave the flag, but then the next day the Palestinians will say, you know, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1476.84s)]
*  what did you do to us? And you know what will happen on the third day? Yaya Sinwar will do what [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1481.16s)]
*  he is known to do, which is he's going to kill 50 Palestinians who come out in protest, and that's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1485.16s)]
*  going to be the end of it. That's going to be the end of it. And how do we know this? Because Sinwar [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1491.3200000000002s)]
*  rose in Hamas by being a guy who killed other Palestinians savagely, all right, savagely. So [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1495.96s)]
*  people should not be... And then you have a situation which Hamas returns to power, all right, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1501.88s)]
*  it is seen as victorious, probably emboldens Hezbollah. What does it do to Israeli politics [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1507.56s)]
*  in turn? Does it move Israeli politics to the left or to the right? I would argue it moves it [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1515.0s)]
*  very far to the right, all right, because the Israelis feel like we've accomplished nothing. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  The problem with Bibi is that he was too weak, not too strong. And so it moves the politics of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1523.8s)]
*  the area into an even more polarized direction, putting the possibility of peace further out of [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1530.12s)]
*  reach. For the moderate Arab states that have made peace with Israel, this is also a disaster [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1535.8s)]
*  because it looks like they made a bad bet in aligning with Israel through the Abraham Accords. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1542.12s)]
*  Hamas is a cat's paw of Iranian power on the Mediterranean, which concerns them. And for [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1548.76s)]
*  our friends in Egypt, Hamas is also an arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, and so therefore also problematic. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1555.8s)]
*  So we emerge from a ceasefire the day after the day after in a much worse position for everyone, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1561.88s)]
*  but most of all the Palestinian people, because there is no possible good outcome for Palestinian [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1568.2s)]
*  people or state if Hamas remains the governing authority. So you keep saying this, if Hamas [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1575.0800000000002s)]
*  remains the governing authority, which is different from what others say, which is eliminating Hamas. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1580.6000000000001s)]
*  So I'm wondering if, for example, the Palestinians, if there were some kind of deal [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1585.8s)]
*  where the Palestinians agreed on a national unity government, you know, that Hamas would, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1591.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, or a government of technocrats, that's something you could accept? Or is your view [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1598.76s)]
*  that, you know, all of these people either have to be killed or they have to leave the country? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1604.52s)]
*  Look, I don't, other than Sinwar and the leaders who should meet some form of justice, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1608.6s)]
*  if Hamas got on a boat tomorrow the way the PLO got on boats in 1982, that would be a fine- [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1613.48s)]
*  Hamas has to leave. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1619.24s)]
*  Hamas has to leave. And by the way, people say, well, you can't eliminate an ideology, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1620.6s)]
*  and Hamas is an idea. Of course you can't eliminate an ideology. In Germany today, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1624.6s)]
*  there are neo-Nazis, all right, but it's a democratic- [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1628.84s)]
*  You can make the ideology unattractive. I'd argue that we got to that point already with the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1634.12s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1638.28s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure we have. And it becomes more difficult if Hamas is allowed to emerge victorious. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1638.76s)]
*  Hamas has, look, you can't get, as we did in 1945, unconditional surrender from Hamas. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1646.12s)]
*  They're never going to do it, right? But you can perhaps get something like unequivocal victory [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1653.56s)]
*  over Hamas so that two things happen. Hamas does not have the capacity to reinstitute its [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1660.12s)]
*  ability to govern in Gaza, right? And some critical mass of Palestinians understand that [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1668.76s)]
*  however sympathetic they may be to Hamas or not, it is a terrible way for them to go. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1677.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I guess, you know, I'm trying to channel some of these students that you mentioned. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1682.28s)]
*  I think their objection to what you're saying is that, you know, you're treating Hamas and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1685.96s)]
*  the Gaza Strip as if it's this like neighboring country that, you know, for no reason suddenly [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1690.76s)]
*  decided to start attacking Israel. And that's not the case. It is a territory that was under [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1697.64s)]
*  occupation, then under a blockade. And, you know, is there another narrative here or is there some, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1703.0s)]
*  you know, to what extent do you credit or at least grant that the folks who say, look, you know, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1708.8400000000001s)]
*  maybe Hamas's ideology is a problem, but you know what else is a big problem? The occupation. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1717.5600000000002s)]
*  You know what else is a big problem? The fact that you've got in the Israeli government people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1722.3600000000001s)]
*  like Bicel Smoczic and Itamar Ben-Refir. And, you know, that's also a problem. The fact that [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1725.88s)]
*  settlement building has continued unabated on Palestinian land. The fact that the two-state [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1732.0400000000002s)]
*  solution that, you know, Shmoz like me keep calling for becomes ever more impossible because [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1738.0400000000002s)]
*  of the actions of the Israeli government that today is bombing Palestinians. Like, to what extent [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1745.5600000000002s)]
*  you at least have to grant that a big part of the reason we're here is not just because Hamas [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1752.44s)]
*  has some timeless animus against Jews, but also because the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1757.72s)]
*  consistently strived to make Palestinians' lives miserable in Gaza and to prevent them from ever [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1764.68s)]
*  achieving their goal of national self-determination. Well, there's a bit of a contradiction in what [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1770.6000000000001s)]
*  you're saying because you first accused the government of Netanyahu of trying to funnel money [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1775.48s)]
*  to Gaza in order to make... To Hamas. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1779.88s)]
*  Well, but essentially with the idea of economic betterment in Gaza to give Hamas a stake in a kind [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1783.4s)]
*  of a stable status quo. And then you've turned around and said, actually, the policy was to [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1791.4s)]
*  immisery Gaza. So you have to choose whether they were trying to funnel money to Gaza or they were [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1796.44s)]
*  trying to immisery. Only an idiot. And I think we might both agree that Benjamin Netanyahu might be [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1800.68s)]
*  part of that, might deserve that appellation. But given what you have said about Hamas' aims [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1806.12s)]
*  and what Hamas would spend any dollar that you give them, clearly Benjamin Netanyahu's policy was [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1813.9599999999998s)]
*  not aimed at... Yeah, I understand. Okay, look, there's a lot of blame to go around. But the blame [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1821.0s)]
*  that we're speaking of now, we can have a general discussion that involves kind of the meta issues, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1828.1999999999998s)]
*  at least between Israelis and Palestinians. And that's an important discussion to have. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1834.04s)]
*  But we can have also a specific discussion of how we went from a state on October 6, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1838.44s)]
*  which had a ceasefire with Israel, which then they violated in the most savage and brutal way [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1844.36s)]
*  imaginable. And the proximate cause of that was a Hamas decision to invade Israel, rape its women, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1850.92s)]
*  kidnap its citizens, murder as many people as it could possibly lay its hands on and do so, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1858.1999999999998s)]
*  and advertise the fact, by the way, because many of the reasons we know about what happened is [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1864.52s)]
*  because Hamas had GoPro cameras that they wanted to show the world. So that's the proximate cause [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1869.2399999999998s)]
*  of the misery. We can separate that at least somewhat from some of the larger issues. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1875.8799999999999s)]
*  A second point is, unlike some of the students that you just referred to, I've been to Gaza a [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1884.68s)]
*  bunch of times, okay, over the years. Before Hamas took over, after Hamas, I was there. Actually, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1889.0s)]
*  probably the best time I was ever in Gaza was in 1989 when I spent a summer in Israel on the kibbutz [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1896.92s)]
*  and one could go into Gaza. And Gaza was just, you know, you just drove right in. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1904.6000000000001s)]
*  The misery weirdly began with, maybe not weirdly, began with Gaza's semi-independence in 1994 and [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1909.16s)]
*  the creation of the Palestinian Authority. So that's an important point. You mentioned the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1918.36s)]
*  settlements. I wish that the settlements were the root cause of the conflict between Israel and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1925.48s)]
*  its Palestinian neighbors. If that were the case, okay, then you might expect that when Israel [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1936.84s)]
*  withdrew every last settlement and settler from Gaza in 2005 and withdrew its forces from the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1943.72s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor separating Egypt from Gaza, that things in Gaza might have become marginally [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1950.68s)]
*  better, not dramatically worse. I have all kinds of problems with a lot of the settlements, for all [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1957.64s)]
*  sorts of reasons. But I think that the argument that they are in some sense the root cause of [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1965.5600000000002s)]
*  the conflict isn't matched by reality. I think they're really not helpful. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1973.0s)]
*  I agree. But in the case of Gaza, there are no settlements. We're not talking about settlements. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1981.0800000000002s)]
*  There are no settlements. Fair enough. But you're right about that. One of the arguments that will [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1984.68s)]
*  be made is that if you want to talk about Palestinian support for Hamas or Palestinian [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1991.64s)]
*  sympathy with what Hamas did, it's a response to the fact that what Israel is doing in the West [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=1996.68s)]
*  Bank is just continuing to eat away at their future state and they see no hope. Again, I wish [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2004.5200000000002s)]
*  people would just simply take Hamas at its word. Hamas' objection is not to this or that Israeli [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2011.0s)]
*  policy. Some of our objections might be to this or that Israeli policy. You might say [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2016.8400000000001s)]
*  they're terrible, they're stupid, they're misjudged. Everyone can have perfectly valid [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2021.32s)]
*  views on that subject. But Hamas' objection is to Israel itself. That's the problem. It's not like [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2026.84s)]
*  I don't want to change your jacket. I want to put a knife in your throat. There's a difference there. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2034.12s)]
*  So your view is that's the root cause of the conflict, that Palestinians in general are just [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2042.28s)]
*  not reconciled to Israel. I didn't say that. Well, so what is the root cause of the conflict then? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2047.48s)]
*  I would say that too much of the Palestinian leadership, which is never ruled in a genuinely [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2055.1600000000003s)]
*  democratic way, is not reconciled to the existence of Israel. I mean, the Palestinian authorities- [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2061.88s)]
*  Israeli Arabs are reconciled to the existence of Israel. But the Palestinians have, the Palestinian [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2069.88s)]
*  authority recognized the state of Israel. They've negotiated over the borders of Israel and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2075.64s)]
*  Palestine. They've disagreed about those borders. And by the way, one of the many other reasons why [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2081.7999999999997s)]
*  it's important to get rid of Hamas is that if the Palestinian authority wants a fighting chance [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2088.44s)]
*  of surviving as a leading and legitimate authority, then they can't have Hamas as their rivals. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2093.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm not exactly certain whether I think that the Palestinian authority [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2100.36s)]
*  should be the governing authority of the Palestinians. I think on this, you and I might agree. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2106.44s)]
*  I want to move on to some other issues. But you wrote in another column, you said that even if [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2111.6400000000003s)]
*  we tame Hamas in Gaza, that's not going to be the end of it. You said that Israel needs to, quote, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2120.2000000000003s)]
*  take the battle directly to Hamas and Hezbollah's patrons, whether in Syria, Qatar, or Iran. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2127.8s)]
*  And I guess I want to ask you, what do you mean by that? Because it definitely seems like [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2135.5600000000004s)]
*  that's a recipe for a World War III. I hope not. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2140.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that ultimately, not all, maybe not most, but a great many of the ills that the devil, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2148.04s)]
*  the Middle East today, and if what happened in 1979 is reversed. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2155.24s)]
*  How are you going to reverse that exactly? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2164.04s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, hopefully. I mean, you said Israel needs to take the battle. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2166.3599999999997s)]
*  It does. Look, there are a few points here. I forgot where I said that. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2170.4399999999996s)]
*  April 9th, call. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2175.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, that was a long time ago. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2176.9199999999996s)]
*  Look, the Iranian power in the Middle East is a root cause, or at least approximate cause, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2178.2799999999997s)]
*  of much of what has destroyed so much of the Middle East. Iranian power has destroyed Lebanon. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2190.52s)]
*  It's destroyed it. I mean, other things also hurt Lebanon, but Iranian power destroyed it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2198.2s)]
*  It was in the process of destroying, if it hasn't already, Yemen. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2203.72s)]
*  One of the reasons, if not the major reason, why this battle between Israel and the radical side [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2210.52s)]
*  of the Palestinian movement exists. And I don't see that ending unless Iranian power [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2218.92s)]
*  is fundamentally dented in such a way that it cripples its ability to try to assert [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2226.68s)]
*  hegemony over its region. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2234.12s)]
*  So Israel needs to go to war with Hezbollah, needs to go to war with Iran in order to dent [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2237.56s)]
*  its ability to support the Houthis, et cetera. What does that look like exactly? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2243.08s)]
*  Well, look, that's- [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that like an Israeli bombing campaign of Tehran? What is that exactly? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2251.16s)]
*  Look, at some point, I suspect that Israel is going to have to have a confrontation with Hezbollah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2255.32s)]
*  You also said take- [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2263.56s)]
*  Which, by the way, incidentally, this is a point worth making. Every single day, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2264.6000000000004s)]
*  tens or more rockets fall into sovereign Israeli territory in the north, which has forced [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2271.6400000000003s)]
*  60,000 Israelis to vacate their homes. They're living in hotels. They're living as internally [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2279.4s)]
*  displaced people. 60,000 sounds like a tiny number to us in the United States, but you have [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2284.6s)]
*  to remember that Israel is a country of nine million or so people, we're a country of 330 million. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2289.96s)]
*  It would be like if Massachusetts simply had to vacate to, I don't know, Schenectady or whatever. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2296.12s)]
*  It is a crisis in the country based on the routine gratuitous and unlawful violation [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2304.68s)]
*  of Israeli sovereignty by a terrorist organization internationally seen as such [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2313.16s)]
*  Hezbollah, which terrorizes the Lebanese people, all of its neighbors, the Syrian people, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2319.3999999999996s)]
*  and is essentially aiming to have a war at some point down the road as it has had before with [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2325.64s)]
*  Israel. I don't see how Israel ultimately succeeds or survives as a country unless in some ways, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2332.04s)]
*  the power of Hezbollah is massively degraded. How that happens, I have no idea, and it's stupid to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2340.28s)]
*  comment because a war could happen tomorrow or it could never happen. Obviously, you never sort of [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2347.1600000000003s)]
*  want a war, but you have to recognize that you have a very serious and determined and well-armed [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2352.0400000000004s)]
*  enemy on one of your borders. So you also said, and no disagreement with you there, you also said, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2358.1200000000003s)]
*  you said take the battle directly. So you mentioned [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2365.0s)]
*  Syria, you mentioned Iran. The other place you mentioned that Israel needs to take the [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2368.5200000000004s)]
*  battle directly to is Qatar. I think that was the column in which I was saying that Israel should not [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2371.6400000000003s)]
*  respond in a major way. It was a council. Must take the battle directly, as it did last week [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2378.84s)]
*  in Damascus to Hamas and Hizbullah's patients. If you read the column, I believe it's called [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2385.6400000000003s)]
*  For Israel, revenge is a dish best served cold, correct? No, that was not the April 9th column. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2390.44s)]
*  Maybe it is. I don't know. This is going to be recorded forever. I don't remember. I do not [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2396.76s)]
*  write in my notes the title of the column, but what is taking the battle directly to Qatar, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2400.6s)]
*  whether hot or cold? What does that look like? Are we bombing Qatar now too? I just want to get [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2405.08s)]
*  a sense of the boundaries of this battle. Battle has a metaphorical quality to it. I don't think [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2410.2000000000003s)]
*  Israeli F-15s are going to be bombing Qataris, but Qatar has been a force for instability and [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2416.76s)]
*  radicalism throughout the region that has gained, I think in my view, far too much influence, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2423.88s)]
*  especially in Western capitals through the use of money and influence. It is a bad actor in the [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2428.6000000000004s)]
*  region and it should be seen as such. Again, I don't want to flog this particular dead horse, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2436.1200000000003s)]
*  but of course, we've all seen the reporting of Netanyahu thanking the Qataris for [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2441.64s)]
*  channel 8. You are going to get no defense. I'm not here. I was writing columns for years [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2447.4s)]
*  calling for Netanyahu to step down. I'm not here to defend the guy. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2453.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to zoom out a little bit and then I would like us to talk about [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2459.72s)]
*  things that are happening in American higher education. We're both Americans. I'm an American [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  Muslim, American of Egyptian extraction, as you described yourself once, a left-handed, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2471.96s)]
*  right-of-center Mexican Jew, but we're both Americans. Let's talk about the American national [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2477.4s)]
*  interest here. There are some people who would make the argument that the United States or the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2485.0s)]
*  Biden administration's seeming abetting of what Benjamin Netanyahu is doing right now in Gaza, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2490.36s)]
*  which even President Trump says or former President Trump says is going too far, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2497.64s)]
*  that this is actually costing the United States massively in terms of goodwill, prestige in the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2502.8399999999997s)]
*  world, and that we may be actually getting to a point where this is not in our national interest. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2510.2799999999997s)]
*  You clearly think it is in our national interest. What's the national interest [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2514.68s)]
*  that is served by Israel continuing this campaign in Gaza? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2518.6s)]
*  Well, I think there's first of all, a moral interest in eliminating Hamas. I just had the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2524.6s)]
*  opportunity to watch Sheryl Sandberg's new film about the rapes. It's hard to watch that and not [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2531.64s)]
*  come away with a clear conviction that Hamas is one of the most evil organizations. I know BB says [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  this, but it doesn't mean it's wrong. It is on a moral par with ISIS. The world took action to [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2549.64s)]
*  do as much as it could to eliminate ISIS because of what happened at the Bataclan in Paris and so [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2556.2s)]
*  many other places. We have a moral interest in not seeing Hamas survive. That's a values question. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2563.24s)]
*  From an interest standpoint, I would make a number of points. Number one, to the extent that Hamas [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2570.7599999999998s)]
*  is a cat's paw of Iranian power. We recognize Iran as part of an axis of whatever you want to [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2578.52s)]
*  call it, resistance, opposition, joined by Russia, China, and North Korea. We have every interest in [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2586.52s)]
*  indenting, diminishing, and embarrassing Iranian power. I think that's a regional interest. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2595.8s)]
*  We also have a broader interest because I think the world is shaping into a conflict between two [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2603.08s)]
*  blocks, if you will. We need, especially now, to be steadfast with democratic allies, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2610.68s)]
*  imperfect democracies, but democratic allies threatened by totalitarian adversaries. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2620.68s)]
*  It's a bad thing for a global superpower to be seen as better to its enemies than it is to its [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2628.6s)]
*  friends. The United States has acquired this reputation in a way that's dangerous to our [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2637.0s)]
*  long-term fundamental interests. It's one of the reasons why the idea of a Trump administration [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2643.24s)]
*  that pulls the plug on Ukraine simply horrifies me because we have a stake in [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2648.8399999999997s)]
*  Ukraine's survival as a democratic state threatened by its neighbor. We have the same [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2656.4399999999996s)]
*  thing when it comes to Taiwan, and I would argue we have the same thing when it comes to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2665.8799999999997s)]
*  Israel. By the way, say let's say tomorrow that the... I saw the sign, thanks. Let's say tomorrow [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2671.72s)]
*  the United States pulls the plug on Israel. Israel is going to still fight, but Israel is not going [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2681.7999999999997s)]
*  to fight as a state that is willing to listen to the United States. It's going to start fight as [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2688.4399999999996s)]
*  a freelancer. We had this experience in a somewhat different way in the Biden administration with [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2694.9199999999996s)]
*  Saudi Arabia when we decided to tell the Saudis, we don't like you. What you did to Jamal Khashoggi [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2700.4399999999996s)]
*  was revolting to help with you. The Saudis said, oh, interesting. Nice. Our friends in Beijing [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2705.64s)]
*  would like to do business with us. Then we went running. Even an incumbent power like the United [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2711.64s)]
*  States can afford to alienate only so many of its adversaries. In the case of Saudi Arabia, at least [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2721.56s)]
*  we had a good moral reason not to like much of what Saudi Arabia did. I think in the case of [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2730.68s)]
*  Israel, whatever else... I know this is not necessarily the most popular view here, but [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  65% of Americans in my view rightly understand that for all of our problems with this or that [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2741.48s)]
*  Israeli policy, they are a democracy which defends liberal values. If you are gay, if you're a [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2747.0s)]
*  minority, if you're a dissident, if you are in any way a person who wants to live in a liberal world, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  then the only country where you can recognize some set of your values is in Israel and we should be [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2760.04s)]
*  on that side. Those are definitely very admirable things about the state of Israel. I guess what I [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2766.28s)]
*  think you're not appropriately appreciating is that a lot of people are starting to question [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2772.28s)]
*  the state of Israel because what they see happening in Gaza seems just so disproportionate and [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2777.96s)]
*  and just catastrophic. I don't want to get back over to the arguments about the number of [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2785.96s)]
*  Palestinians who have been killed, but it's massive. This is exactly where I want to take [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2791.96s)]
*  the conversation anyways. Look, we've got all these students in the yard who are encamped there and [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2798.2000000000003s)]
*  are very angry. In one of your columns you said that some of this stuff that's happening on campus [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2806.84s)]
*  is a recrudescence of past bigotries. Some of it is anti-Semitism. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2815.3999999999996s)]
*  I think what a lot of these kids would say is, no, look, I just don't like big strong Israel bombing [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2824.2s)]
*  the Gaza Strip into oblivion and killing all these people. What's wrong with that? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2831.72s)]
*  Well, look, when a student leader in Colombia says, it's a good thing I'm not murdering Zionists [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2837.2400000000002s)]
*  right now and kill all Zionists, or people who are visible Jews walk into one of these encampments [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2844.76s)]
*  and someone says the Zionists are coming, I think that's a pretty good indication that anti-Semitism [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2850.6800000000003s)]
*  might be more prevalent than they would admit. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2856.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so those are the things you're objecting to. In other words, let's say there wasn't any of that [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2863.3199999999997s)]
*  and let's say that the students were laser focused on divesting from Israel, right, as long as Israel [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2868.6s)]
*  is occupying Palestinian land and as long as Netanyahu's bombing Gaza, then you would have [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2876.4399999999996s)]
*  no issue with it. Well, no, I would have a disagreement with it. But it wouldn't be anti-Semitic. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2882.12s)]
*  Look, if your objection is to Israeli policy, then I don't think it's anti-Semitic. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2887.0s)]
*  If you don't like the way Israel's conducting its war in Gaza, if you think that it's one thing or [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2894.28s)]
*  another, then it's an objection to a policy. When you say that the one Jewish state in the world [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2900.52s)]
*  is the one state you are laser-like focused on wanting to see disappear, then I am going to [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2907.7200000000003s)]
*  really question where that sentiment is coming from. And if the nature of your critique of Israel [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2917.0s)]
*  mirrors in almost uncannily precise ways older anti-Semitic tropes, then I'm also going to [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2926.84s)]
*  raise some questions and quarrels with what it is you're saying. For instance, if your argument is [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2938.6s)]
*  Israel's harvesting Palestinian organs, this is an echo of an older blood libel. It never occurs [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2946.28s)]
*  to you for one second that it's problematic that we are arming our friends in Turkey, our allies in [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2956.36s)]
*  Turkey, and we are defending them with nuclear weapons and a nuclear guarantee in NATO, even as [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2961.8s)]
*  they're bombing the Kurds. But you would never think once in your life to go raise a flag in [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2967.0800000000004s)]
*  sympathy of the Kurds, but the one cause about which you are this uniquely impassioned, then I [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2973.3199999999997s)]
*  have an objection to it because you are singling out Israel in a way that applies to no other [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2981.3999999999996s)]
*  country on your horizon. And I find that curious. The Turkey example you bring up is a good one [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2987.56s)]
*  because that's a fair analog to Israel. It's an ally of ours, et cetera. Last time I checked, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=2994.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that what the Turks are doing with the Kurds rises to the magnitude of what we're [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3002.36s)]
*  observing in Gaza. But don't you think it's possible that somebody could latch on to the [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3008.28s)]
*  occupation and to the Palestinian issue and to really dedicate a lot of energy and passion to it [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3015.4s)]
*  without them having a be in their bonnet about Jews? Sure. I think there's a lot of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3023.0s)]
*  there's a lot of well-meaning protests by people who are looking at what they're seeing on [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3028.92s)]
*  television and they say, I don't like this and I'm going to oppose it. And I think that's fine. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3034.7599999999998s)]
*  I also think that if you're doing it at Harvard, there is a presumption on my part that you will [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3041.64s)]
*  take the time to have at least complicated and informed views about the totality of the conflict. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3047.16s)]
*  And part of my objection to in fact, the deepest part of my objection to some of these protests [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3055.32s)]
*  isn't even the anti-Semitism to the extent that you see it. It's the complete lack of nuance. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3061.32s)]
*  It's the complete lack of an appreciation that maybe there's more than one side to this. There's [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3068.04s)]
*  a complete lack of interest that maybe your Israeli friends or peers on the university aren't simply [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3073.2400000000002s)]
*  emblems of evil in the modern world, that there's a history that you might not understand the [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  totality of and that it behooves you to at least make an effort to understand this before you go [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3085.48s)]
*  and make various kinds of moral commitments. And furthermore, by the way, if your Jewish friends [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3092.12s)]
*  are telling you again and again, what you are saying is very troubling. And let me tell you [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3098.3599999999997s)]
*  why it's very troubling. And you make no effort to listen to them. You make no effort to say, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3105.48s)]
*  hang on a second, some of the views I'm expressing, some of the slogans I might be repeating, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3110.84s)]
*  like from the river to the sea, aren't simply unproblematic calls for freedom, but are in fact [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3116.28s)]
*  calls for the elimination of an entire state. If you're not doing this, I would say you shouldn't [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3121.56s)]
*  be at Harvard. You shouldn't be at an institution like Harvard. Because what we expect of students [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3126.6800000000003s)]
*  at Harvard is intellectual equipment. And equipment comes with the ability to process [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3132.76s)]
*  complexity, process nuance, and also have the humility to say, maybe I don't know everything [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3138.92s)]
*  about something. I think you're right. But I think that this lack of humility, this inability [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3144.2000000000003s)]
*  to process complexity, this unwillingness to listen to alternative points of view is [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  quite uniformly distributed among the population, regardless of their particular views on this [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3156.1200000000003s)]
*  conflict. So it's something I observe, frankly, on both sides. And I guess, I will not be able [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3162.68s)]
*  to leave this room alive unless I don't open it up for questions. But I guess the question I have [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3171.96s)]
*  for you is, so much of the opposition now to these protests, et cetera, is framed as [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3178.12s)]
*  you know, that frames these protests as anti-Semitic, as harmful, that these people [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3186.36s)]
*  who are saying from the river to the sea or calling for intifada now are somehow harming [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3192.6s)]
*  students. And you know, my response to students who come and say this to me, and for whom I have a [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3198.52s)]
*  great deal of respect and sympathy, is that they look, yes, obviously a lot of these things are [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3203.2400000000002s)]
*  very difficult to hear. But we need to be tough. We need to be strong. And so if somebody says [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3207.4s)]
*  something like this, instead of us collapsing or becoming wounded or hurt, you need to, you know, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3214.28s)]
*  make your counter argument. If somebody says, look, I don't like you because you're a friend of the [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3221.6400000000003s)]
*  state of Israel, you should say, well, I don't like you because you're the kind of person who [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3226.92s)]
*  doesn't like friends of the state of Israel. And we don't necessarily need to take it to this place [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3230.28s)]
*  where we look to administrations to protect us from anti-Semitic discourse that, you know, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3235.2400000000002s)]
*  why can't we just let people say what they want to say and we make our best arguments to those who [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3241.16s)]
*  want to listen and those who want to listen, you know, let them talk. I think that's great. I mean, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3245.0s)]
*  in general, we're all better served with thicker skins, right? And part of the purpose of, you know, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3250.68s)]
*  part of the purpose of a university is to make you feel unsafe, at least intellectually, right? I mean, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3257.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that that is entirely legitimate. I think what I hear many Jewish students objecting to [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3263.96s)]
*  is this, all right? Universities have established a standard of great sensitivity to certain kinds of [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3271.0s)]
*  hurtful speech. And they've established another standard when it comes to Jews and Israelis of [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3281.6400000000003s)]
*  toughen up, buttercup, right? And I think that is part of the problem here that if we were to think [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3288.7599999999998s)]
*  of equivalent forms of speech, right, against other groups, I have my doubts that Harvard would be so [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3295.72s)]
*  indulgent. And if part of what makes anti-Semitism anti-Semitism is the double standard, is the idea [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3303.7999999999997s)]
*  that we have a certain set of rules for this group of people, but for the Jews, it's a little bit [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3313.24s)]
*  different. And in this case, the idea for I mean, this is one of the things that bothers me about [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3317.8s)]
*  the free speech debate, like, I'm entirely in favor of the rights of these students to [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3322.28s)]
*  protest in camp. Listen, I have no affiliation with Harvard, they want to mess up the lawn. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3327.32s)]
*  That's fine by me, right? Okay, I really couldn't could care less. But free speech is a terrific [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3332.1200000000003s)]
*  standard. It is not a terrific double standard. And what we've seen now is free speech as a double [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3340.52s)]
*  standard. Okay, when Claudine Gay suddenly discovered the importance of free speech, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3346.52s)]
*  it came as a bit of a surprise to say the Carol Hoovins of the world, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3353.96s)]
*  right, who had not been afforded some of the same kind of liberality in terms of indulging [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3358.12s)]
*  difficult points of view. Carol Hoovins is a colleague of ours who, former colleague of ours, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3365.32s)]
*  who, you know, resigned her teaching position because of all of the pressure she was getting [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3370.36s)]
*  because some of her views on gender. So how do we, but the point is, you know, you mentioned our [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3375.48s)]
*  former president, Claudine Gay, but you said she discovered, right, free speech. So that's great. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3381.4s)]
*  She got to the point where she recognized that we need to allow people to say what they have to say [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3387.72s)]
*  and let's, how do we get to that point? You know, so you're right that maybe we haven't always [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3393.16s)]
*  operated that way. What would be the way that institutions could get there that would satisfy [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3398.36s)]
*  you that we're not applying some kind of double standard? Like what would you like the president [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3404.52s)]
*  of Harvard to say or the president of the, I mean, University of Chicago, your alma mater [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3408.84s)]
*  doesn't have this problem, but the president of Columbia University, what should they say to make [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3412.6s)]
*  you, that would cause you to think, okay, these institutions are now drawing a line under the past [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3417.0s)]
*  and they are recommitting themselves to this notion of unfettered free discourse? Look, I think it's [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3422.36s)]
*  going to be a long road, but one of the ways in which you do it is by proving that you are willing [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3427.72s)]
*  to have as students and faculty people who hold views with which you have very vehement disagreements. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3432.44s)]
*  And so if you can have Charles Murray as a speaker, I'm just, he occurs to me, okay, I'm not, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3442.52s)]
*  obviously, right, but he's the obvious, if he's the obvious guy, Charles Murray can come [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3449.0s)]
*  and speak and if you can have professors with views that are well to the right of mind, because, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3453.56s)]
*  I mean, sometimes it's a weird thing in my life if I'm not viewed as a fascist by the left, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3459.32s)]
*  I'm viewed as a complete rhino by the right, but if you can have professors and students who represent [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3465.88s)]
*  a genuine diversity of views and you can have an environment in which those views are both free to [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3475.8s)]
*  flourish and free to encounter vigorous intellectual challenge in an atmosphere of [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3484.68s)]
*  respect, but not safetyism, to borrow a great phrase, then I think you're doing something, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3495.4s)]
*  you're doing something right. Okay, this is great, we have to take questions, so, okay, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3503.7200000000003s)]
*  we've got a lot of hands up, put your hand up with, raise it with pride so I can see it, okay, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3508.44s)]
*  you sir over there, we're bringing a mic to you, yes. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3513.16s)]
*  My name, my name is Randy Feldman, I'm a graduate student here. The Israeli incursion into Gaza [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3518.3599999999997s)]
*  involved such heavy demolition by bombing, was that done to all the people, whatever the number [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3526.2s)]
*  that died, in order to save Israeli soldiers' lives when it entered to go hand-to-hand combat, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3533.3999999999996s)]
*  and was that level of bombing just simply immoral to save Israeli soldiers when they did [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3541.08s)]
*  enter Gaza to fight? Well, the answer to your question is I don't know, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3548.04s)]
*  and I think, by the way, the words I don't know are great words, particularly for journalists to [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3554.92s)]
*  use, I don't pretend to know the minds of Israeli military planners. I do know that Israel faces a [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3559.7999999999997s)]
*  unique military challenge in Gaza because Hamas has entrenched itself in this extraordinary [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3569.0s)]
*  network of tunnels, and so there was going to be no easy way for Israel to meaningfully diminish [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3577.16s)]
*  and demolish Hamas's ability without inflicting the kind of pain and devastation that they have [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3589.32s)]
*  inflicted. I think it's worth thinking comparatively about what Israel has done [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3597.48s)]
*  against analogous situations, and the best comparison that we have that's relatively [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3603.96s)]
*  contemporary is what the United States did in Mosul. If you go to Google, I think Foreign Policy or [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3610.76s)]
*  one of those magazines had it, they had before and after pictures, this is the United States in tandem [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3617.16s)]
*  with the Iraqi forces, of what happened to the city of Mosul when we were trying to wrest it back [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3623.24s)]
*  from ISIS. It looks much worse than Gaza does today because that's the nature of the military [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3629.72s)]
*  challenge, and it took Iraqis and American forces nine months, where you said we're at seven months, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3636.8399999999997s)]
*  nine months to dislodge ISIS from less entrenched positions in a smaller territory, and the level [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3643.4799999999996s)]
*  of devastation was catastrophic. What was the death toll? I'd have to look it up, and I don't want [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3651.96s)]
*  to use casualty figures that I'm not sure of. The death toll was quite high, I think it was [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3659.7200000000003s)]
*  in the many thousands in a much smaller area, much smaller city. So it's important, look, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3669.56s)]
*  Israel should be judged, but it has to be judged in some kind of reasonably comparative [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3677.4s)]
*  context. In this tragedy that happened with the aid workers a few weeks ago in which seven were [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3683.0s)]
*  killed, of course you look back at it and you say how is it possible that the Israelis, with all of [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3690.6800000000003s)]
*  their know-how, killed these seven workers who were trying to do just what they were doing? Until [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3696.04s)]
*  you remember that the United States demolished a medicine-sans-frontier hospital in, I think it was [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3702.36s)]
*  Kandahar or Jalalabad, somewhere in Afghanistan, again based on faulty intelligence. So judge [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3710.36s)]
*  Israel, but at least put it in the context of what other democratic, law-abiding states have done in [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3717.32s)]
*  similar military situations. I read somewhere that at Princeton, at least, I don't know what [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3729.32s)]
*  the case is at Harvard, there are no military historians. It just happens for pleasure that I [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3735.7200000000003s)]
*  was rereading Ron Chernow's biography of Grant. It's worth rereading because we have statues to [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3741.48s)]
*  Grant and we think of Grant as a great American. Grant starved Vicksburg into submission. So let's [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3750.36s)]
*  think about military situations, at least with the understanding that horrible things happen in [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3756.76s)]
*  military situations and they have to be judged in that light and not according to this sort of [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3763.0s)]
*  make-believe standard that surely the Israelis, with all of their know-how, could have whiz-banged [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3769.6400000000003s)]
*  their way into only killing Hamas and never harming a Palestinian civilian. Life doesn't work that [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3774.92s)]
*  way. I mean maybe this is my sort of prejudice as an American. I just don't like to think that our [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3780.2799999999997s)]
*  country somehow falls short on that. But if you talk to people who know about this, they will say, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3789.56s)]
*  for example, we never dropped on Mosul, ordinance of the size that the Israelis are dropping on [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3796.04s)]
*  Gaza. That argument that you're making is contested. I understand every argument is contested. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3801.96s)]
*  I've also seen arguments that 2,000-pound bombs have delayed fuses so that it goes down before [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3812.76s)]
*  it explodes. This is a type of munition that doesn't explode on impact but penetrates and [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3820.44s)]
*  then explodes. The truth is I'm now out of my lane. I suspect that most of us in this room who [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3826.92s)]
*  opine so sagely about the kind of munition that this army should be dropping on that target. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3834.52s)]
*  But you're the one who said that Israel's conduct in the war is not worse than the United States' [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3840.36s)]
*  conduct in the Iraq war and I'm just not sure that's right. What I am saying is if you look at what [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3848.12s)]
*  we did quite self-righteously against ISIS and Mosul, a much more distant threat to us than Hamas [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3854.44s)]
*  is to Israelis, at least looking at it from the perspective of aerial photography, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3861.0s)]
*  it doesn't look much better. Robert? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3868.6s)]
*  Hi, sir. I'm Robert Moser. I'm a public policy student here. You said that it's right to criticize [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3874.44s)]
*  Israel on the basis of its policies and so I would like to. The U.S. killed estimated 9,000 [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3881.08s)]
*  civilians in Mosul, so approximately one-fourth of the number of Gazans that the Gaza Health [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3887.64s)]
*  Ministry has claimed to kill. My question is if one of the goals should be to defeat Hamas, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3893.96s)]
*  and I agree Hamas should be defeated and the other goal should be return the hostages, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3902.7599999999998s)]
*  which I also agree, neither of those are really happening but we are killing four times as many [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3907.64s)]
*  Gazans as the Americans killed. So the policy is not working. Why is it so difficult to just say [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3915.16s)]
*  this policy isn't working? We need to do something else. Well, we don't know if the policy is working [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3921.64s)]
*  or not. No, we do. No, we don't actually because if Hamas is dislodged from Gaza with an operation [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3927.4s)]
*  in Rafah in the next month, then we would have a very different conclusion. We are in the middle of [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3936.84s)]
*  the war. By the way, Mosul is a much smaller place with a much smaller population, much of which [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3944.04s)]
*  had been evacuated beforehand. We are not counting, even if we accept the 30,000 number, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3949.56s)]
*  then we're not counting at least 13,000 Hamas fighters who also have to be included in that [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3955.88s)]
*  in that global number. Ultimately, the test of successful policy is you end up with a Gaza [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3963.56s)]
*  in which Hamas does not have the ability to repeat what it did on October 7th. And maybe we're going [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3973.56s)]
*  to get there and I hope we will. And I think that the way we don't get there is by having an [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3979.8s)]
*  immediate ceasefire. But by the way, one last point, these are absolutely legitimate points to [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3984.04s)]
*  bring up. They're absolutely legitimate. And I don't want to suggest that I feel like I have 100% [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3991.0s)]
*  confidence or even 60% confidence that I'm right. Most of us, if we're right 51% of the time, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=3999.8s)]
*  it's an absolute miracle. And it's a particular miracle if we're right on small points. What I'm [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4007.0s)]
*  trying to argue, simply for the purposes of sparking thought and meaningful, productive [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4011.24s)]
*  discussion, is that leaving Hamas in power with a ceasefire now or tomorrow is a, in my view, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4018.84s)]
*  likely recipe. I said surefire earlier, but let me take that walk that back. A likely recipe [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4029.0s)]
*  for this tragedy to be repeated again and again. And how do I know that? Because Hamas has said [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4034.28s)]
*  time and again, we will have a second October 7th and a third October 7th and a fourth October 7th. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4039.48s)]
*  So for you, Brett, this war doesn't end unless we produce the dead bodies of [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4044.84s)]
*  Yahissinwar and Hamas leadership or they wave the white flag and get on... [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4050.28s)]
*  No, neither. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4055.4s)]
*  ...the Qatar. How do we know that the, how will we know that we've defeated Hamas? Those are the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4056.04s)]
*  only ways, right? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4062.1200000000003s)]
*  You probably know in five years or 10 years. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4062.76s)]
*  So the war continues... [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4066.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, it reminds me of this wonderful exchange that Henry Kissinger had with Zhou Enlai in 1972. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4066.84s)]
*  Too early to tell about the French Revolution. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4072.8399999999997s)]
*  Who do you think are the results of the French Revolution? Too early to say. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4073.7999999999997s)]
*  But we've got to have an end to this bombing campaign. So when do we know that? What will [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4076.8399999999997s)]
*  satisfy Brett Stevens that the bombing can stop, the military operation in Gaza can end? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4082.8399999999997s)]
*  When we have a sense that Hamas does not... [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4089.96s)]
*  How do we have that sense? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4092.2s)]
*  Well, for instance, Hamas fired rockets at Steroot, I think, this morning, right? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4093.96s)]
*  They retain significant war fighting capability. We don't know quite what that is, in part because [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4098.92s)]
*  we will have trouble knowing it until we eliminate, we, the Israelis, eliminate the last bast... [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4105.08s)]
*  what appears to be the last bastion of meaningful Hamas power in the Strip. But I'm not... [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4112.28s)]
*  It would be foolish to say, well, I have a surefire way of knowing this. You're going to [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4121.48s)]
*  know it when you know it. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4125.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm just trying to figure out when do we get to the day after and it sounds like, you know, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4126.36s)]
*  you don't know, which I then think makes his question kind of valid. Like, it sounds like [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4130.44s)]
*  this is a policy that doesn't have an end point. It's like the US and Vietnam just reporting on a [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4136.36s)]
*  daily basis. This is how many people we killed with no sense of the end point. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4142.28s)]
*  You are right in this sense in that I do not think... [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4145.96s)]
*  I think I'm plagiarizing something I heard you say, actually. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4149.16s)]
*  Yes. No, I think you are. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  Look, I think you have a misapprehension of what policy is. Okay? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4156.759999999999s)]
*  Possibly. I'm a professor of public policy, but... [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4160.679999999999s)]
*  Well, but that's why. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4165.0s)]
*  In this sense, then you would know better than anyone that to say this policy is going to [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4167.08s)]
*  deliver this result, okay, is just either a lie or a form of self-deception. We do not know [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4172.12s)]
*  what policy will deliver what result. You can have excellent policies... [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4181.0s)]
*  But you should know what policy has failed. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4185.32s)]
*  Hang on a second, all right? And we're far from knowing that the policy has failed. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4188.12s)]
*  All I'm saying is you have to ask yourself an honest question about what will probably bring [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4191.96s)]
*  about a better result without a guarantee that you will reach that result. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4197.24s)]
*  Okay. I have a lot of hands up. I'm going to shut up for the rest of this conversation. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4201.32s)]
*  Okay. I have you, Gabriel. I'm going to try to get some gender diversity in the questions too. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4205.4s)]
*  Okay. Hi, my name is Gabriel Moberg and I'm one of TARC students. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4211.24s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4216.84s)]
*  For him, yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4217.48s)]
*  In... To end conflict in Colombia, amnesty had to be given to certain members of FARC that had [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4218.36s)]
*  engaged in war crimes and atrocities. And it seems that often reaching a sort of peace [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4226.679999999999s)]
*  settlement requires some kind of trade-off between justice and peace. And sometimes we [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4233.32s)]
*  end up giving amnesty to people who we don't think should get it. I'm wondering with all your talk [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4238.84s)]
*  about needing to defeat Hamas, how you think about that and how you think about the experience that [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4243.96s)]
*  we've had of ending other civil wars through kind of compromises where we do grant amnesty to many [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4249.08s)]
*  people who have done committed atrocities or war crimes. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4254.76s)]
*  Well, you're raising an excellent example, which is that the FARC had inflicted on it devastating [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4258.28s)]
*  military blows and various kinds of humiliations like the rescue of Ingrid Betancourt, I think [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4263.96s)]
*  that was in 2008. And they reached a point when they thought that they could not continue [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4269.4s)]
*  as a military force. And so they pursued a different option. I think in fact, there's a great [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4275.08s)]
*  logic to offering a very broad amnesty to most Hamas fighters or an amnesty combined with exile. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4281.4s)]
*  And I think it's very difficult to say what precisely is a formula, I mean, certainly from [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4290.84s)]
*  here, a formula that works. In 1982, Arafat left Beirut. He got on a boat with a lot of his fighters. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4297.0s)]
*  There's a report that Israeli sharpshooters had Arafat in their sights and did not pull the trigger. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4307.24s)]
*  And I can imagine a scenario in which every single remaining Hamas, self-identified Hamas fighter [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4315.400000000001s)]
*  gets on a ship and goes to, I don't know, out to this in the case of wherever, you know, elsewhere. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4323.240000000001s)]
*  Doha problem. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4330.84s)]
*  Doha problem, you know, just gets out. I think the only exceptions to that are the people who [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4331.72s)]
*  organized and ring-led the attacks of October 7th who have to meet some kind of justice. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4336.92s)]
*  Okay, I have Maya Ilani over here. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4343.56s)]
*  Hi, thank you. I'm Maya. I'm also one of TARC students. I have a question about what you said [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4353.4800000000005s)]
*  about the, and I'm Israeli as well, that the biggest threat to Israel and maybe the whole region [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4359.400000000001s)]
*  now is Iran, actually, and its proxies, Hezbollah, Hamas. And your colleague from the New York Times, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4364.68s)]
*  Thomas Friedman, wrote very recently that Israel is facing a choice between [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4371.32s)]
*  Ra'fa or Riyadh. And when you think about the threat Israel is facing from Iran, which path [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4375.5599999999995s)]
*  do you think is more likely to lead the country to abolishing that threat? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4382.679999999999s)]
*  I tend to think, and I love Tom, he's a great guy, I think he has it exactly wrong. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4390.36s)]
*  I think the Saudis, whatever they're saying in public, are cheering the destruction of [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4397.08s)]
*  Hamas because Hamas represents a double threat to who they are. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4404.599999999999s)]
*  Why do you say that? I've heard you say that before. I think that's totally wrong. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4410.04s)]
*  Why? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4414.759999999999s)]
*  Because every Saudi I talk to expresses tremendous frustration. They say, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4415.4s)]
*  Israelis think that we don't care about the Palestinians. Israelis think that we see Hamas [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4420.36s)]
*  as a threat to us. We don't, and we do care about the Palestinians. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4426.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I think the degree of cynicism in Saudi policy is high. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4431.799999999999s)]
*  This is your evidence? I mean, the Saudis are saying... [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4440.679999999999s)]
*  There are two reasons. There are two reasons. The first is that Hamas has become an extension [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4444.759999999999s)]
*  of Iranian power. You have in Saudi Arabia, a country that is facing an Iranian threat, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4450.2s)]
*  not only to its east, but now increasingly to its west, with the Houthis, with Hezbollah, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4458.04s)]
*  and now with Hamas. A victory for Hamas is a victory, not just propagandistically, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4463.88s)]
*  but strategically for Iran because Iran entrenches itself on two separate locations on the [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4471.08s)]
*  Mediterranean, never mind the Red Sea. The second thing is, especially this Saudi regime, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4475.64s)]
*  which is moving away from stricter types of Islamism, does not want to see the [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4481.8s)]
*  recrudescence, if you will, of a highly successful and at least ideologically attractive [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4491.160000000001s)]
*  Islamist movement. I think the Saudis, whatever they're saying in public, would be very happy [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4498.6s)]
*  to see Hamas, as I said, meaningfully defeated as the reigning power in Gaza, because I think [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4505.48s)]
*  they're actually eager to have a chance at full ties with Israel. They're not looking for full [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4512.36s)]
*  ties with Israel, in my understanding, because they've discovered the joys of the Talmud. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4518.12s)]
*  I think they're looking at it because they see Israel as a strong and capable state that is [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4521.959999999999s)]
*  willing to take the battle, to use my word, against common enemies in Tehran. You don't think, though, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4526.919999999999s)]
*  You want to leave the students? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4534.68s)]
*  But I have to ask a follow-up on this, and then we'll come to the students. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4538.2s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that the average Saudi, the average Egyptian, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4543.48s)]
*  sees what's happening in Gaza, and they are horrified. These governments know that if they [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4550.2s)]
*  are seen to be standing idly while Israel continues to pummel this immiserated territory, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4557.08s)]
*  that's not going to be good for them. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4563.24s)]
*  You know what's not going to be good for them is if this war is happening again in five years, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4564.92s)]
*  and then again in another five years. I think what they want is a change in the status quo, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4570.2s)]
*  and that doesn't happen until Hamas is defeated. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4575.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm with you on that, although I will note that you don't know when this war [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4577.719999999999s)]
*  would end, and you said it could be another five years. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4581.48s)]
*  But, excuse me, hang on a second. I mean, you're charging against me, such as it is. I don't know [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4583.24s)]
*  what the future holds. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4589.639999999999s)]
*  I absolutely plead guilty to the fact that this is not Brett Stevens' crystal ball. And guess what? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4591.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't have one either. What I can do is offer what I think is hopefully a halfway intelligent [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4601.88s)]
*  argument as to why leaving Hamas in power is a recipe for things getting worse, not better. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4609.320000000001s)]
*  Your argument is more than halfway intelligent. The only point is that, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4616.44s)]
*  as you know in your response to Robert's question, it's just clear that there's no evidence that [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4619.639999999999s)]
*  somebody could give you that the policy is failing because you're so committed to this idea that [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4624.44s)]
*  you're impervious to evidence. And he's telling you, look, you've killed, you know, the state of [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4631.24s)]
*  Israel has killed thousands of people. I don't know how many it is. The hostages have not returned. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4636.2s)]
*  I mean, this does not look like a recipe for success. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4641.24s)]
*  Okay. So who did I have in the very back there? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4646.28s)]
*  Not quite the very back. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4650.84s)]
*  Well, not the very back. Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4652.04s)]
*  Thank you. My name is Yasmine. I'm an NEMI-AI fellow. I'm a Palestinian citizen of Israel. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4656.12s)]
*  I agree with you about the fact that keeping Hamas will keep the circle of violence. And we will see [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4662.12s)]
*  this again and again as we've seen it. As someone who lives in the area, it's even more times than [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4668.679999999999s)]
*  you've mentioned. So we have it every year, almost military operations in Gaza. But in the West Bank, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4675.4s)]
*  Hamas is not the governing authority and it is still under oppression and occupation of the Israeli [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4683.24s)]
*  military and government. And I'm going to go with what you offer. Let's say tomorrow morning, we have [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4690.5199999999995s)]
*  Tarek's magic wand and there's no Hamas. How does the future of the Palestinians look like [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4697.879999999999s)]
*  without Hamas, without, you know, with only Israeli policy governing and keeping in mind [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4704.76s)]
*  what is happening in the West Bank, in East Jerusalem, and also on Palestinians in the sense of Israel? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4712.04s)]
*  So I would hope there... [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4719.24s)]
*  I consider myself a Zionist and I believe that intrinsic to my Zionism [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4721.72s)]
*  is the belief that Zionism is a call for Jewish self-determination, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4735.240000000001s)]
*  which means that we are not ruled by others and that we do not rule others. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4743.400000000001s)]
*  Israel should not be in the business of ruling others. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4752.68s)]
*  It is ruling others, in my view, because of a tragic historical circumstance [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4757.56s)]
*  from which it has in fits and starts, sometimes with good faith and sometimes with bad, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4764.4400000000005s)]
*  been trying to extricate itself for many years. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4769.72s)]
*  If Hamas did not exist tomorrow, then any [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4772.68s)]
*  sensible Israeli government should be working all the time to find a way [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4779.88s)]
*  to separate from the Palestinians with the goal of creating a Palestinian state [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4787.0s)]
*  that is independent, viable, prosperous, progressive. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4792.12s)]
*  That is the goal. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4796.76s)]
*  That is the goal. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4799.56s)]
*  That is absolutely any Israeli government that has any sense of itself as a responsible [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4802.2s)]
*  Zionist government should want a separation from the Palestinians. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4809.4s)]
*  I am reminded that in 2005 I went to Ramallah and Bethlehem and other places to write one of the [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4814.04s)]
*  stupidest articles of my illustrious career in stupid articles. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4820.2s)]
*  It was titled From Strong Man to Good Man, and it was about the election of Mahmoud Abbas, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4826.36s)]
*  who was my good man in that. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4831.879999999999s)]
*  He is now in the 20th year of his elected four-year term of office. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4835.24s)]
*  On a pragmatic level, the elimination of Hamas would also require [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4841.0s)]
*  the reinvention of the Palestinian authority so that it is not the kind of [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4846.919999999999s)]
*  the kind of kleptocracy, that is maybe the nicest word to use for it, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4852.84s)]
*  the gerontocratic kleptocracy that it is now. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4860.68s)]
*  At that point, if Israel has the assurance that withdrawal from territory is not going [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4865.56s)]
*  to lead to existential danger, every effort has to be put into creating a viable and proud [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4872.12s)]
*  Palestinian state. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4878.2s)]
*  All right. I have Jason. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4880.12s)]
*  Thank you for speaking to us. I'm Jason. I'm a researcher at the Belfer Center here, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4886.04s)]
*  and my question is about some of the rhetoric that had been mentioned earlier coming out of some [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4890.28s)]
*  members of the Israeli government. As you know, two members specifically, Smotrich and Ben Gavir, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4894.599999999999s)]
*  have made statements calling for the resettlement of Gaza and calling it a place where, quote, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4900.04s)]
*  two million people wake up every morning wishing to slaughter and rape and murder Jews. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4905.08s)]
*  What is your reaction to these statements, and how do you think people should respond to the [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4910.04s)]
*  existence of these sentiments in very prominent members of the Israeli government? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4914.36s)]
*  Well, they're despicable sentiments. Again, and this goes to something I said earlier, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4918.68s)]
*  they're despicable sentiments from despicable characters who should not be in any government. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4926.92s)]
*  Let's also keep in mind that in France, 40% of the electorate voted for a fascist, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4931.64s)]
*  and we're just out of one Trump regime and about to embark on another. So when people note the [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4939.72s)]
*  presence of fascistic characters in the Israeli government, that's a fair point to make. It should [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4949.400000000001s)]
*  also be put in the context of the fact that in many Western countries, the government is [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4955.400000000001s)]
*  in many Western democracies, including nice countries like Sweden, where far-right parties [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4961.08s)]
*  are a major part of the government. You also have bad actors who say dreadful things, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4965.88s)]
*  and that's a shame. But they're not just saying dreadful things, right? I mean, they just annexed [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4973.88s)]
*  a big chunk of the West Bank. I mean, they are pursuing a policy that makes a two-state solution [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4980.36s)]
*  Yes, and that is why it's so important to have guys like me opposing them. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4987.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, very good. I'm glad that we have guys like you opposing them. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4992.12s)]
*  I have this gentleman who's been very patient. That was a presumptuous comment. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=4996.04s)]
*  It's funny that you mentioned the fascist in France because this fascist supports Israel currently. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5005.8s)]
*  My question is about, you mentioned Nazi Germany. You drew a parallel with Nazi Germany. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5013.4800000000005s)]
*  I will allow myself to ask my question relying on the fact that Nazi Germany did not come from [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5024.68s)]
*  nowhere. Nazi Germany did come from a decade of humiliation, a decade of sanctions imposed by France. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5029.240000000001s)]
*  I think we can all draw the same parallel with Palestine. My question is, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5036.2s)]
*  Matthew 5.39, if a man hits your right cheek, turn the other one to him as well. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5045.32s)]
*  Having trouble understanding what you're saying. You just quoted the Bible, right? If somebody [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5051.24s)]
*  hits you on the cheek, turn the other cheek. Exactly. Don't you think it would have been a [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5054.92s)]
*  better strategy for Israel to turn the other cheek like allies did after the second world war? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5059.08s)]
*  Your question reminds me of something that Eric Hoffer, the great philosopher, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5066.6s)]
*  said in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times in 1968. He said, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5070.6s)]
*  Israel is the only country in the world expected to behave like a Christian nation. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5078.36s)]
*  Quoting Matthew, of all people, I think reinforces that point. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5084.2s)]
*  When France felt itself under threat after various terrorist events culminating horrifically in the [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5091.4800000000005s)]
*  Bataklan, they went off to Africa, to their former colonies, and did what they did, including [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5102.200000000001s)]
*  killing civilians accidentally, all kinds of things. But I find it's just strange that the [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5111.96s)]
*  expectation is that Israel is the country that should turn the other cheek. America did not [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5118.36s)]
*  turn the other cheek after 9-11, and I remember when Osama bin Laden was killed. Jubilation in [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5124.839999999999s)]
*  the streets, Obama taking star turns everywhere. I know of no other country in the world where [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5130.44s)]
*  the idea is, well, you should turn the other cheek when you are wantonly attacked. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5138.679999999999s)]
*  Now, you raise the analogy of Nazi Germany, and it is true that [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5143.72s)]
*  Versailles and the peace had something to do with the rise of Nazism. But what also had something [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5151.24s)]
*  to do with the rise of Nazism was that Germany allowed itself to be won over by a grotesque [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5161.16s)]
*  anti-Semite whose mission in life was not simply to reverse the results of Versailles by retaking [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5171.72s)]
*  Alsace or something, but conquering Europe, eliminating the Jews, and creating a master race. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5181.0s)]
*  The world understood that this evil was so unique and so uncontainable if it was allowed to remain [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5190.6s)]
*  in any shape that they committed itself to its complete destruction. I have a personal stake in [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5198.52s)]
*  this story not only because I am the son of a survivor and of a hidden child, but because my [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5204.92s)]
*  father-in-law was a German child, not Jewish, German child in Hamburg in 1943, when the people [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5210.52s)]
*  we now consider heroes did vastly worse to Hamburg than Israel has done to Gaza, vastly, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5220.2s)]
*  vastly worse in one night, not over six months. Now, we can argue about the morality of those [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5228.12s)]
*  tactics, and I think that is a valid question. But I do not think what is a valid question is [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5235.72s)]
*  whether, for instance, the Allies should have stopped once some equivalence had been established [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5240.599999999999s)]
*  in terms of the proportion of people killed, or once France had reclaimed its borders and Belgium [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5247.32s)]
*  and Holland and Denmark had reclaimed their borders. They understood that you could not allow that [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5252.759999999999s)]
*  regime to survive in any shape or form if you wanted some kind of better future. The analogy is [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5258.12s)]
*  not at all perfect, but I think fundamentally it is valid, that if you allow a regime like Hamas, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5265.24s)]
*  which says openly, we will have another October 7th and another October 7th and another October 7th, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5272.92s)]
*  you are not solving a problem or ending bloodletting. You are creating a recipe for [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5280.04s)]
*  much greater tragedies to follow. So in some sense, I think your analogy to Nazi Germany is [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5286.84s)]
*  an apt one, but judging by the direction of your question, perhaps not in the way you intended. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5294.12s)]
*  I think this is a good note on which to end. The point you make about the outsized expectations of [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5299.08s)]
*  the state of Israel, I think you have to admit that those expectations derive from all of the [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5305.4s)]
*  things that are so admirable about the state of Israel. You were the one who pointed out that [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5312.759999999999s)]
*  Israel is a democracy, Israel is progressive, etc. So it is reasonable to hold it to that standard, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5317.5599999999995s)]
*  and why are the students protesting Israel and not, for example, protesting China? Because [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5324.28s)]
*  Israel is a democracy and there is somebody who might listen. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5331.08s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So I know we don't want to go too far over time. Israel should not be held [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5334.28s)]
*  to any standard lower than what we hold our country to, right? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5339.96s)]
*  Plenty of kids here who hope our country is. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5346.28s)]
*  Wonderful. Examine American history. Examine American history. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5349.08s)]
*  That means we have to repeat American history. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5354.36s)]
*  No. Examine American history and examine recent American history. And if you feel at the end of [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5356.04s)]
*  that, right, that America, you know, this is, then change the standards, but at least hold Israel to [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5364.36s)]
*  the same standard. I mentioned, we talked about speech earlier, and I said free speech is great [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5370.84s)]
*  as a standard, it's not great as a double standard. That goes also for the general conduct of the [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5375.64s)]
*  state faced with not simply a tactical or strategic threat, but with an existential threat. And some of [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5380.6s)]
*  that understanding should color it. One final point, if I can make, which I really enjoyed [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5388.6s)]
*  this conversation, this is great, and I enjoyed also the challenge, okay. I try to operate in a [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5393.240000000001s)]
*  way in which, you know, these issues have no pat solutions. No public policy is guaranteed to get [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5401.56s)]
*  you in an outcome. We walk through the world half blind, right, at best, right? But what we can do [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5410.84s)]
*  is sharpen our thinking by having intelligent encounters with opposing points of view, as I've [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5420.6s)]
*  had this evening, right, opposing points of view with a certain kind of sense of humility about all [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5426.76s)]
*  the things that we don't know and all the many things that could go wrong, but also some kind [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5435.08s)]
*  of confidence at least advancing an argument and a point of view and testing it. And I hope that's [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5440.12s)]
*  what becomes of the university, that you don't just sit in your silos, pro this, anti that, but [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5446.68s)]
*  there's some kind of great encounter. That's what a university ought to be doing. And that's, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5453.08s)]
*  I think, what we did tonight. I think that's, you stole all my lines, but absolutely, Brett [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5458.52s)]
*  Stevens, first of all, I just want to thank you. I know there are tremendous demands on your time, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5464.76s)]
*  lots of people asking you to come and speak at their institutions, and the fact that you [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5469.72s)]
*  agreed to come speak here is a great honor for us. And I hope you'll, I'll be able to convince you to [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5473.96s)]
*  come back. I also want to thank the audience. You guys asked great questions. They were very [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5479.8s)]
*  respectful, and I certainly learned a great deal. While I'm thanking people, this is the end of this [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5484.52s)]
*  series, so I need to thank a few people. I want to thank Brian Conroy of the Kennedy School, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5491.320000000001s)]
*  and I want to thank the Harvard University Police Department, who has just been absolutely, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5497.0s)]
*  absolutely tremendous. Dennis Downing, Andrew Gilbert, Christopher Riccardi, Brian Spellman, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5503.240000000001s)]
*  Kevin Healy. I want to thank the gentlemen who have been filming all of these, and particularly [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5512.200000000001s)]
*  Claudio Jimenez, who mics us up. And I want to thank Setti Warren and Andrew Goldman of the IOP, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5517.8s)]
*  Bennett Craig of the Belfour Center, and Sarah Donahue and Shannon Spence of the Belfour Center. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5524.76s)]
*  But finally, none of this series would have been possible. I would probably not even be dressed, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5530.52s)]
*  were it not for my team at the Middle East Initiative, Julia Martin, Sam Himmelman, and [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5537.8s)]
*  Paige Ferrer, really without them, none of this would have been possible. So thank you. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5544.200000000001s)]
*  And once again, Brett Stevens, thank you. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7Z-F_Mx7o&t=5549.160000000001s)]
