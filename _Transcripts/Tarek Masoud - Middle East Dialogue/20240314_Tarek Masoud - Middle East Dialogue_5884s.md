# Middle East Dialogues: Tarek Masoud in conversation with Dalal Iriqat
**Tarek Masoud - Middle East Dialogue:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA)
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Tarek Massoud. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4.42s)]
*  I am a professor here at the Kennedy School, the faculty director of our Middle East Initiative. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5.82s)]
*  And it's my great pleasure to welcome you to the third in our series of Middle East [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=12.98s)]
*  Dialogues, which is a series of conversations that I've been having with people whom I believe [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=18.72s)]
*  to hold very important perspectives on the war in Israel and Gaza and the state of the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=23.66s)]
*  broader Middle East. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=30.42s)]
*  And our guest today is Professor Dalal Saeb-Araqat of the Arab American University in Palestine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=31.42s)]
*  Professor Araqat is a scholar of conflict resolution, international relations, and public [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=40.86s)]
*  diplomacy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=46.42s)]
*  She has a doctorate from the Sorbonne, and she's completed additional training in leadership [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=47.8s)]
*  at Stanford and in negotiation here at Harvard. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=52.54s)]
*  She is a young leader of the world, young global leader of the World Economic Forum. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=57.18s)]
*  And she's written very broadly on the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the impact of COVID-19 on the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=65.14s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territories, and on institution building under occupation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=70.94s)]
*  She's a columnist for El Pud's newspaper, and her work has been published by Haaretz, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=77.22s)]
*  the Jerusalem Post, the Institute for Palestine Studies, Political Geography, the Palestine-Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=82.02s)]
*  Journal, among many other venues. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  She just arrived yesterday from Ramallah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=90.66s)]
*  So she also brings to us a very grounded perspective on what is happening right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  And I'm extremely grateful to her for making time to participate in our series. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=99.5s)]
*  So many of you have been to these before. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  You know the drill. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=106.82s)]
*  We'll talk for about 45 minutes to an hour. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=107.82s)]
*  Then I will take questions from my students before opening it to the audience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=111.36s)]
*  And I hope we will end by about 1.30. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=115.06s)]
*  I want everybody to know that the event is being recorded. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=118.12s)]
*  So if you do ask a question, you are, by participating in that act, offering your consent to having [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=122.16s)]
*  your voice and visage recorded for posterity and spread all over the internet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=129.72s)]
*  The other thing I want to tell you to do is even extremely important. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=136.62s)]
*  How many of you own a cell phone? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=142.84s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=144.88s)]
*  Could you take your cell phone and turn it off? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, very important. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=148.6s)]
*  If a cell phone starts ringing during this event, I cannot be responsible for my actions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=150.24s)]
*  There's also some material that I've been given to read about possible disruptions, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=159.62s)]
*  but there are not going to be any disruptions, so I'm not going to read it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=163.32s)]
*  Please join me in welcoming Professor Delal Saib-Arafqar. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=166.04s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=170.14s)]
*  Thank you all for being here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  And thank you, Tareq, for this invitation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=176.42s)]
*  You are most welcome, but I'm not asking you to give a speech yet. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=179.06s)]
*  No speech. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  No speech. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  No speech. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  So can I just say before we get started, you and I met about a year ago, actually almost [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  exactly a year ago in Ramallah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=191.89999999999998s)]
*  And I have to say that Dr. Delal was one of the people who I've met in the last five [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=195.38s)]
*  years who made the most immediate and positive impression on me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  We were at a lunch with academic and intellectual and civil society leaders, and Ramallah and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Delal really struck me as a very passionate advocate for freedom for Palestinians. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=211.84s)]
*  And what struck me the most is that she was an advocate not just for the freedom of Palestinians [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=218.0s)]
*  from the Israeli occupation, but also from authoritarianism that has been imposed upon [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=224.26s)]
*  Palestinians by those who ostensibly represent them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  And Dr. Delal can testify that I've been trying to get her here for quite a long time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  And if you had told me in March of 2023 that when Dr. Delal finally did come here, it would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  be under a real cloud of accusations in the media about radicalism, about support for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=248.38s)]
*  terrorism, that we would even be condemned by a United States senator for inviting you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=257.06s)]
*  here, I would not have believed it back then. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=263.3s)]
*  And so Dr. Delal and I have agreed that we would actually start this conversation by [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=267.14s)]
*  talking about the reason for those accusations, which is some of the social media. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=272.94s)]
*  But I'm hopeful that we'll not spend most of our time on that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=279.98s)]
*  So I just want to testify that we're doing this by mutual agreement, correct? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=284.96s)]
*  Yes, I asked him to do so. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=288.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=290.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=291.94s)]
*  So should I start? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=292.94s)]
*  Yeah, but I have something to say before we start. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=293.94s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=294.94s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=295.94s)]
*  That's when I share that I'm absolutely eager to engage today, to discuss, to debate, and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=296.94s)]
*  also to learn from you guys. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=302.14s)]
*  I really believe that this is going to be an opportunity for us to hold a difficult, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=304.26s)]
*  yet a constructive conversation. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=310.46s)]
*  I want to share with the audience that as a professor inspired by Socrates, I always [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  tell my students, I cannot teach you anything. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  And I don't want to teach you anything. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  But I really want you to think. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=322.14s)]
*  And I come from Palestine today with the intention of not winning any arguments today, Tarek. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=324.14s)]
*  I really want us to engage in a constructive, looking forward, solution-oriented debate [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=329.3s)]
*  and informative discourse that is very much needed everywhere, but especially at Harvard. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=334.98s)]
*  And universities as higher education institutions are expected to be the homes for knowledge [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=340.18s)]
*  production. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=344.70000000000005s)]
*  So that's why today I'm hoping that Tarek and myself will be able to walk the talk of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  the motto of Harvard of Veritas, where our knowledge production for today will be based [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  on truth and facts rather than mere opinions. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=359.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=360.06s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Zunano. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=361.06s)]
*  I very much appreciate it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=362.06s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to pull up the first tweet. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=363.06s)]
*  So this is the tweet that was most often cited. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=367.62s)]
*  And this was on October 7th. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  And the part of this tweet where you start by noting the great privation and pressure [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=377.34s)]
*  under which the Gazans have been living since 2005. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=383.46s)]
*  But then you say today is just a normal human struggle for freedom. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=389.38s)]
*  And on October 7th, as we know, 1,200 Israelis killed, the vast majority of them civilians, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=393.62s)]
*  women, subject to sexual assault, innocent partygoers slaughtered. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=400.29999999999995s)]
*  How is that a normal human struggle for freedom? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=405.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=409.7s)]
*  Well, as I said, I'm not here to teach you anything, but maybe it's an obligation for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=410.74s)]
*  academics and it's an ethical and legal obligation to maybe try to educate a little bit on what [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=414.42s)]
*  international law is about and what UN General Assembly resolutions came with. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=420.5s)]
*  And I want to focus on the term today is a just normal human struggle for freedom. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=426.3s)]
*  You know, UN General Assembly resolution 3314 of 1974 and UN resolution 37 on 43 of 1982 [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=432.94s)]
*  implicitly, clearly spells out the rights of every people for struggle for freedom under [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=443.34s)]
*  occupation with all available means, including armed struggle. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=449.94s)]
*  So in me portraying or reflecting on UN General Assembly resolutions is by no means justifying [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=454.7s)]
*  any violence. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=462.66s)]
*  It is, and I really urge you to look at the screen and see it was 6.43 a.m. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=463.66s)]
*  At that time on the 7th of October, six months from now, all we have seen, our screens were [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=470.66s)]
*  fed with images of hundreds of Palestinian unarmed civilians who were running on bicycles, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=478.06s)]
*  paragliders, hundreds of civilians trying to break into the fence seeking their freedom. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=487.46s)]
*  So that was exactly what I was reflecting on. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  Until that timing, actually until the evening hours, nothing was reported on any casualties. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=499.62s)]
*  No kidnapping, no nothing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=506.7s)]
*  Nothing was reported on the other side. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  All we had been receiving was images of Palestinian young elderly children just fleeing into [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=511.18s)]
*  the border, the fence to try to break the siege, to try to break the deadly blockage [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=519.02s)]
*  and see that they have been suffering for 17 years. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=524.82s)]
*  And yes, I would like to contextualize here that we cannot neglect the fact that the Palestinian [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=529.34s)]
*  people have been suffering for 76 years now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=535.84s)]
*  Let's focus on Gaza for now. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=540.02s)]
*  16 years of deprivation of basic rights should not be tolerated by any of us. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=542.3s)]
*  It is not okay that we have been learning that 2.3 million civilians, 50% of those are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=548.66s)]
*  children. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=555.14s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=556.14s)]
*  A million children under the age of 18 living in Gaza being deprived of simple standards [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=557.14s)]
*  of education, mobility, hygiene, health system. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=564.06s)]
*  So interestingly enough, I want to share a fact with you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=568.42s)]
*  You know, in the 21st century and 2024, internet services, Wi-Fi services don't go under the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=571.06s)]
*  line of human rights, but it's a human need. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, who of us can live without Wi-Fi? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=582.38s)]
*  In the best-case scenario, the Gaza civilians can only enjoy 2G services. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=586.42s)]
*  Not because they don't have the infrastructure, not because they don't have the human or natural [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=592.98s)]
*  resources that would provide for networks, etc., etc. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=598.1s)]
*  It was only because the Israeli military occupation authorities decided that they cannot enjoy [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=601.38s)]
*  internet. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=607.22s)]
*  In the West Bank, the case is not much better. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=608.22s)]
*  The best-case scenario is 3G services. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=612.1s)]
*  So here I'm just trying to show that this is not a periodic flare-up. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=614.62s)]
*  This is a reflection of 76 years of apartheid, of Israeli military occupation, of settler [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=620.98s)]
*  colonialism, of confiscations of lands on daily basis that come for the best interest [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=628.98s)]
*  of building more settlements on our grounds, of daily extrajudicial killings that we witness [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=635.5s)]
*  in every Palestinian city. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=640.98s)]
*  And here we're talking about every Palestinian city, not only Gaza, in the West Bank, including [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=643.4200000000001s)]
*  The daily arrests and detentions. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=648.42s)]
*  And very recently, we are facing the danger and threat of settler terrorism. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes, I call it settler terrorism. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=657.18s)]
*  They are attacking us everywhere. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=660.3399999999999s)]
*  We are no safe anywhere. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=661.78s)]
*  So when the Palestinian people struggle for their freedom, this should not provoke anybody. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=663.9599999999999s)]
*  And this should not be interpreted as justifying violence against anybody. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=670.06s)]
*  I hope I'm clear. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=675.5s)]
*  I really appreciate that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=676.58s)]
*  You recommended that I read an article that you wrote in the Palestine, I think it was [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=680.58s)]
*  the Journal of Palestine Studies, or at least the website of the Institute of Palestine [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=686.94s)]
*  Studies called Gaza the Caged Context. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=691.56s)]
*  And so this was a week later, October 13th, and you said, quote, the events of the last [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=694.22s)]
*  few days mark a historic and natural human yearning for freedom. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=699.82s)]
*  You described Hamas's taking of hostages, which, as you know, included women, children, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=703.8199999999999s)]
*  and the elderly as coercive diplomacy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=708.86s)]
*  And you said, as you've just said now, that international law guarantees the right of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=711.98s)]
*  people to defend themselves against aggression. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=716.3399999999999s)]
*  And so that was the week after October 7th. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=719.98s)]
*  And reading that article, it kind of does sound like you're saying October 7th was self-defense, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=722.42s)]
*  and it was therefore justified. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=729.06s)]
*  What am I getting wrong in interpreting your article that way? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=730.98s)]
*  Again, I reject the framing of October 7th, Israel-Hamas war, because we just cannot negate [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=735.98s)]
*  the fact that this satiric colonial project started 76 years ago. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=742.46s)]
*  When it comes to coercive diplomacy, I'm a professor of diplomacy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  So coercive diplomacy is a science, it's a field of studies. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  If you look at any hostage exchange deals in our recent history, even including the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=756.1s)]
*  ones with the Islamic movements, Hezbollah, et cetera, et cetera, it was always referred [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=761.9s)]
*  to as coercive diplomacy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=766.7s)]
*  And you know, hostages are usually taken, this is against international humanitarian [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=768.7s)]
*  law. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=772.22s)]
*  I am aware of that, and I did reflect on that, that Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=773.22s)]
*  sorry, not 49, but it specifies that taking hostages is prohibited in international humanitarian [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=777.94s)]
*  law. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=783.5s)]
*  However, this is a tactic that's been used throughout history, and it has been used as [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=784.9s)]
*  a tactic in coercive diplomacy and putting more pressure in the negotiations. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=789.46s)]
*  It's a tactic that's been used throughout history. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=793.82s)]
*  That certainly can't be the argument for why it's permissible, right? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=796.22s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=803.42s)]
*  I did not justify it in any way, Tarek, and I'm not saying it's permissible. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=804.42s)]
*  I'm just saying from an academic perspective, if you want to apply theory to practice, I [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=809.1s)]
*  think it's wise to try to see how different negotiating parties would use hostages in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=814.14s)]
*  the negotiations processes. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=820.06s)]
*  Even the Israelis, they have been using it against us ever since the peace process had [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=821.98s)]
*  started. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=825.78s)]
*  Even the prisoners who were taken, even before the Oslo occurs, up until this moment they [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=827.54s)]
*  are still held behind Israeli bars. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=833.38s)]
*  Israel did not release them in respect to their obligations under the peace process [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=835.78s)]
*  that was signed. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=840.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=841.3s)]
*  I mean, you have actually clearly stated that the taking of hostages is against international [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=842.3s)]
*  law. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=850.54s)]
*  It also doesn't seem to have worked. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=852.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=854.62s)]
*  I mean, so I want to come back to something that you said about the deprivation in Gaza, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=855.62s)]
*  which is actually quite horrific. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=863.02s)]
*  If people are not familiar with what is happening in Gaza, I urge you, before October 7th, I [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=864.9399999999999s)]
*  to familiarize yourself with it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=870.84s)]
*  Gazans were really living, they were trying to make the best of a very bad situation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=873.04s)]
*  Though there are photographs of, oh, they had malls, or people, there were sites of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=879.04s)]
*  children's parks, etc., that doesn't mean that this is not a terrible situation. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=888.04s)]
*  I guess part of the question though is, whose fault is it? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=892.16s)]
*  What I don't understand is why Hamas does not bear more culpability in your view, not [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=897.44s)]
*  just for what is happening now, which I think you could make a very strong argument that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=902.96s)]
*  they brought on the people of Gaza, but ever since 2005, the way that Hamas has governed [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=908.24s)]
*  Gaza, I'm not going to say, as some people say, they could have turned it into a Singapore, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=913.96s)]
*  that's not possible, but they could have turned it into something more than a staging ground [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=919.72s)]
*  for periodic rockets attacks against Israel. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=923.12s)]
*  So where is Hamas's culpability in all this, and why is Hamas in your framework viewed [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=926.16s)]
*  as a legitimate entity representing the Palestinian people, engaging in coercive diplomacy, engaging [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  in self-defense? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=941.56s)]
*  I think of this as a group that's taken the Palestinians, at least the people in Gaza, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=943.12s)]
*  as hostage for the last 17 years. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=946.64s)]
*  Well, I think Hamas is the fig leaf that the Israeli right-wing government is using, which [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu had empowered over the years. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=953.56s)]
*  So some people are under the impression that in 2005, the Israelis withdrew from Gaza and [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=956.08s)]
*  that they granted freedom to Gaza. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=962.32s)]
*  Allow me to correct what happened. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=964.84s)]
*  They did actually dismantle the settlements in Gaza in 2005, and around 6,000 to 9,000 [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=968.12s)]
*  settlers were withdrawn from Gaza then. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=974.12s)]
*  But it was Sharon's aide, Dov Weissklaas then, who said it himself. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  He said, this is formaldehyde. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=985.4799999999999s)]
*  This is just to hinder any political horizon between Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=987.9599999999999s)]
*  Later, Netanyahu also, until recently, kept saying that I am the only one capable of hindering [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=992.64s)]
*  any two-state solution, and that he is the only one capable of the divide and rule between [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=998.92s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1003.5999999999999s)]
*  So what I'm trying to tell you is that while some people are under the impression, because [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1005.12s)]
*  of the biased Western media collaboration with the Israeli Hezbollah machines, which [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1009.76s)]
*  tried to mislead the audiences for so long and put them under the impression that, yes, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1017.64s)]
*  Hamas is in control of Gaza, let me tell you, until the 6th of October, nobody, nothing [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1023.12s)]
*  could go in or out of Gaza without an Israeli permission. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1031.44s)]
*  They did withdraw the settlers, but never, not for one single day, had they seized their [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1036.36s)]
*  control over the borders, whether by land, by sea, or by air over Gaza. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1041.4399999999998s)]
*  You could ask anybody, even consul generals, ambassadors, whoever. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1048.08s)]
*  If you wanted to visit Gaza before October 6th, you need a permission from the Israeli [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1053.32s)]
*  authorities and not from Hamas. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1058.1799999999998s)]
*  Am I clear? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1059.76s)]
*  Hamas won the elections. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1061.36s)]
*  Hamas did a coup d'etat. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1063.76s)]
*  I'm not saying, I'm not negating those facts. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1065.72s)]
*  Yes, they're not, maybe they're not the best in public administration, but the fact that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1068.32s)]
*  we are under the impression that Gaza is free and 2.3 million Palestinians were free under [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  the Hamas rule, this is something that I must bluntly reject. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1079.56s)]
*  This is not an Israel-Hamas war that we are witnessing. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I live in Ramallah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1088.08s)]
*  I'm just coming from Palestine. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1090.2s)]
*  For the past six months alone, more than 420 Palestinian civilians have been murdered [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1092.36s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1099.6s)]
*  On a daily basis, we have incursions and invasions of Israeli military troops coming into every [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian city in Gaza and refugee camp. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1106.4399999999998s)]
*  In Nablus, in Kalkilia, in Tulkarim, in Jenin, in Ramallah, in Jericho, in Hebron, in Bethlehem, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1109.84s)]
*  even in Jerusalem. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1116.4399999999998s)]
*  Every Palestinian is targeted to the Israeli military machine. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1118.36s)]
*  No matter where you are. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1122.08s)]
*  This is a war against truth and this is a war against the Palestinian right to self-determination. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1123.76s)]
*  What we are witnessing on the ground is a translation. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1130.48s)]
*  It's a practical translation of a settler colonial project that has been going for decades. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  And allow me to share with you from an academic perspective, from a well-read background, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1138.32s)]
*  that this is all inspired by the Balfour Declaration, which referred to the non-Jewish communities [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1143.04s)]
*  living there as minorities. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1149.96s)]
*  You have to tell everybody what the Balfour Declaration was. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1152.0800000000002s)]
*  As I said, I'm not here to teach them things, but I want them to think, I want them to go [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1154.72s)]
*  on research and I'm sure I want to provoke their curiosity as well. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1158.88s)]
*  World War I era. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  But I want you maybe to... [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1163.8000000000002s)]
*  Sorry, can I just tell everybody what Balfour was? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1165.28s)]
*  World War I era promise by the British to the Jewish community to allow them to establish [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1167.24s)]
*  a homeland in present-day Israel. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1172.44s)]
*  Yes, go on. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  The second paragraph in the Balfour Declaration literally said that the non-Jewish communities [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  can only enjoy religious and civil rights, but never political rights. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1182.28s)]
*  This means looking at the Palestinians who were actually the majority then, as minorities [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1186.84s)]
*  who can never enjoy the right to self-determination. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1191.24s)]
*  This is exactly what we are seeing today. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1194.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is using Hamas as a fig leaf. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1196.6s)]
*  And yes, it's a very nice, easy-selling card to the Western minds and audience, even for [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1198.96s)]
*  somebody like me. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1204.8s)]
*  If you come and tell me, you know, look, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, it is easy to link Hamas to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1205.96s)]
*  terror, to ISIS, to Daesh, to Iran. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1211.8799999999999s)]
*  It is the fig leaf that Netanyahu had been empowering. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's not a secret. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu had been allowing the cash money to go to Hamas via Ben-Gurion Airport. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  I wonder if Netanyahu did not allow cash to go to Hamas to pay salaries, etc., would [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  you have said, good job? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1234.8799999999999s)]
*  Would you have said, great, thank you for starving Hamas of resources? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  Or would you have said, you know, you're starving Palestinian civil servants in Gaza of their [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1239.9199999999998s)]
*  salaries? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1244.76s)]
*  No, I came here to engage in a constructive, difficult conversation. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1245.76s)]
*  I'm asking, I'm asking. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1249.1999999999998s)]
*  Because Dr. Delel, Dr. Delel, Dr. Delel. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1250.6799999999998s)]
*  But it just seems like, so first of all, again, we should get into the, particularly some [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1254.1599999999999s)]
*  of the more extreme crimes that settlers in the West Bank are, and there's a very good [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1261.2s)]
*  story in the New Yorker this week about it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  But I just want to, I want to just talk about or get, get kind of clarity on how you see [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1268.16s)]
*  October 7th and its aftermath and particularly the problem now. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1274.24s)]
*  And I guess what I'm feeling in your comment is a lack of an interest or willingness to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1278.68s)]
*  take on some agency. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1287.32s)]
*  In your view, it seems Hamas, the Palestinians, constantly the victim. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  There's nothing that we could have done. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1294.4s)]
*  Yes, you're right. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1295.5200000000002s)]
*  The Israelis control what goes in and out of Gaza. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1296.5200000000002s)]
*  But Hamas controls what people do with the things that come in and out of Gaza. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  Why did they build tunnels and rockets as opposed to right now? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1304.46s)]
*  30,000 Palestinians have been killed in what I think is a very inhumane bombing campaign. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1309.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1314.64s)]
*  I think it's you could even go further and say there are war crimes being committed right [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1315.64s)]
*  now. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't stop it right now by releasing hostages. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1319.32s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1321.24s)]
*  And I don't hear you saying, Hamas, stop, release the hostages. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1322.24s)]
*  When you talk about the settler, when you talk about the settler violence, you know, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1328.36s)]
*  read any story about settler violence and read any story about the noble Palestinian [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1333.08s)]
*  resistance to settler violence, and you'll always find accounts of five or six Israeli [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1337.2s)]
*  activists are with the Palestinians standing against the settler violence. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1342.24s)]
*  You are a liberal, highly educated, you know, and I know you to be a very peace loving person. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1346.9199999999998s)]
*  But you're not willing to assign culpability to or at least some of the culpability for [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1354.8s)]
*  this situation to Hamas. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1359.52s)]
*  I said in so many media appearances, and I urged Hamas in so many media appearances that [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1362.54s)]
*  I'm not trying to share here too, that they need to release the civilian hostages who [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1368.0s)]
*  are kept in Gaza. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1372.36s)]
*  This is not because I have a say on Hamas or anything. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1373.86s)]
*  This is because I respect international law. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1378.02s)]
*  As I just said, it is clear in the first Geneva Conventions. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1379.74s)]
*  However, I'm not here to speak on behalf of Hamas, Yatari, and I'm here to speak on behalf [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1383.4599999999998s)]
*  of my people, the Palestinians, our struggle, our rights, and I am here as a professor of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1388.2199999999998s)]
*  conflict resolution who is very passionate and dedicated to bring about change in our [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1392.74s)]
*  societies to a more looking forward, better sustainable, strategic, peaceful timings for [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1398.42s)]
*  our people and for my children and others, whether for the Israelis or the Palestinians. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1404.54s)]
*  But to keep putting the, to play the blame game, I really don't find it wise now as thousands [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1410.26s)]
*  of souls are perishing, as Israel is still murdering and massacring and shelling anything [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1417.5s)]
*  that is civilian in Gaza. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1423.9s)]
*  They targeted all universities. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1425.98s)]
*  Can you imagine they did not leave infrastructure for any education, let alone schools, nurseries, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1428.42s)]
*  medical services, clinics, homes, residential buildings. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1434.46s)]
*  Nothing is left to be human in Gaza. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1439.98s)]
*  And I want here to touch upon some international reports that used to come years, years before [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1443.02s)]
*  October 7, that Gaza was, you know, identified as not very humane place in the 21st century. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1448.78s)]
*  So can you imagine now it's turned into rubbles. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1455.74s)]
*  You know, people are still under the rubble. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1458.7s)]
*  The number is 30,000 Palestinian souls. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1460.98s)]
*  My own son who's 15 years old told me last month, mama, the lesson I learned in the past [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1466.34s)]
*  months is that our lives are not equal to those of our peers living whether in Tel Aviv [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1473.06s)]
*  or Paris or New York or Shanghai. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1480.38s)]
*  Is this the lesson that we want our children to learn today? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1483.1s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the humanity, Tarek. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1487.06s)]
*  When I say justice, I say justice for all. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1490.1s)]
*  When I say never again, I say never again for all. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1492.54s)]
*  We should not justify violence for anybody. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1495.3s)]
*  No rape against anybody. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1498.9799999999998s)]
*  No kidnapping against anybody. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1500.58s)]
*  But while 8,000 Palestinian prisoners are behind Israeli jails, we should not also tolerate [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1502.62s)]
*  that Israel continues to commit all different war crimes against the Palestinian people [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1510.06s)]
*  while enjoying every impunity possible. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  And when we dare to speak, when we dare to be vocal, when we dare to criticize the Israeli [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1517.82s)]
*  right-wing government, when we dare to speak against the Israeli military occupation that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1523.78s)]
*  is abnormal in the 21st century, we automatically get labeled as being anti-Semitic. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1528.86s)]
*  Well, okay, so there's a couple of threads to pull on here. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1536.42s)]
*  How would you respond to somebody who says, look, Dr. DeLat, I don't understand how you [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1542.0200000000002s)]
*  want Israel to respond to what happened on October 7th. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1546.3400000000001s)]
*  Doesn't Israel have some right to go after Hamas, which perpetrated these crimes? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1550.98s)]
*  If you grant that Israel has the right to do that, well, the fact of the matter is that [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1558.1000000000001s)]
*  Hamas hides among civilians in Gaza. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1562.66s)]
*  And so it's not possible to go after Hamas without incurring civilian casualties. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1565.5s)]
*  How do you respond to that argument? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1572.7s)]
*  So Article 51 of the UN Charter and Article 31 of the Rome Statute tells it clearly that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1575.06s)]
*  everybody has the right to defend themselves. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1584.78s)]
*  However, if we want to take it from a legal perspective and interpret the articles according [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1586.82s)]
*  to what we're witnessing on the ground, Israel as the occupying state cannot claim that it [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1592.06s)]
*  is defending itself against a community that it occupies. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1598.9799999999998s)]
*  I'm speaking law now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1602.78s)]
*  However, I am very empathetic. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1605.2199999999998s)]
*  And I took this negotiations course at Harvard where Dan Shapiro, who was with us here, wrote [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1608.6599999999999s)]
*  about emotions and negotiations. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1614.58s)]
*  And I learned about empathy. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1617.2199999999998s)]
*  I learned about empathy and I'm very proud to say that I am an empathetic person. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1619.22s)]
*  And I could, I can empathize with the Israelis with the shock that they had been going through [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1623.5800000000002s)]
*  on October 7. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1630.5s)]
*  October 7 started and ended for the Israelis on October 7. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1632.22s)]
*  But on the Palestinian side, it's still ongoing up until this moment. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1636.46s)]
*  Every hour two Palestinian mothers die. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1641.98s)]
*  You know, tomorrow we celebrate International Women's Day. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1643.9s)]
*  So we want to be empathetic and we want to understand the perspectives and where everybody [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1647.5s)]
*  comes from. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1651.78s)]
*  And we want to understand that it's not only Israel that can claim to have the right to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1652.98s)]
*  self-defense. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1657.14s)]
*  Also, the Palestinians have the right to resist, as I said, the right to struggle for freedom [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1658.14s)]
*  under occupation, the right to defend themselves. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1662.3s)]
*  The shock doctrine that Israel is practicing had been going for so long. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1665.94s)]
*  I think they need wisdom at this moment. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1671.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying that they should not, you know, hold Hamas accountable, for example. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1673.18s)]
*  But I'm a professor who claims to be civilized. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1679.5800000000002s)]
*  So I want to remind you here that there are legal international tools that can hold Israel [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1683.14s)]
*  and Hamas accountable. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1687.8200000000002s)]
*  Why don't we resort to the ICC to hold accountable every person who took part in those crimes? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1689.38s)]
*  Why don't we resort to the ICJ, which is the International Court for Justice, to take care [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1697.14s)]
*  of those people? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1702.94s)]
*  It is not my job as Dala al-Iraqat or Netanyahu as the Prime Minister of Israel to hold people [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1704.1000000000001s)]
*  accountable. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1710.22s)]
*  There are some legal tools. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1711.22s)]
*  If we are diplomatic, if we are legal, if we are civilized, as we claim, then resorting [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1712.3400000000001s)]
*  to international legal tools should not be offending to anybody. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1718.7s)]
*  You know, on an abstract level, you know, part of me understands what you're saying, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1723.22s)]
*  It just seems, A, incredibly unrealistic to assume that the state of Israel would not [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1729.78s)]
*  respond militarily to this attack, which even you admit was extremely horrific. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1734.54s)]
*  There's also a little bit of an asymmetry in the way you talk about this. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1740.74s)]
*  It's like when Hamas takes women and children hostage as its course of diplomacy, when Israel [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1743.82s)]
*  responds to it militarily, it's suddenly a violation of all kinds of... [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1750.5s)]
*  And so you talked about empathy. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1756.3s)]
*  So this is another tweet that we agreed we would talk about. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1758.74s)]
*  So this is the next day where you said, we'll never forgive the Israeli right-wing extreme [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1763.18s)]
*  government for making us take their children and elderly as hostages. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1768.02s)]
*  And so what was that tweet about? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1772.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1775.66s)]
*  Well, before we go into the explanation, I want to admit that lacking any context or [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1776.66s)]
*  any rigorous analysis, I admit that this could be interpreted in a controversial way. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1782.34s)]
*  However, again, I was inspired by a famous lady who's called Golda Meir. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1788.46s)]
*  And going back to empathy... [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1796.3799999999999s)]
*  Golda Meir, the former Israeli prime minister? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1798.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1800.6599999999999s)]
*  Again, I assume that people are knowledgeable here. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1801.46s)]
*  Well, it's going to be on YouTube and... [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1803.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1805.98s)]
*  So, yes, being inspired by the words that she said about the Arabs and the Palestinians, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1807.98s)]
*  can you imagine how her words had fallen from her ears? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1816.5s)]
*  I actually talked about taking hostages. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1822.3s)]
*  She talked about killing the Palestinians. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1826.06s)]
*  What's the Golda Meir quote? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1828.22s)]
*  Just say it because I don't think people know it. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1829.6200000000001s)]
*  She said, we will never forgive the Arabs for making us kill their children. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1831.78s)]
*  Yeah, she said, we might forgive the Arabs for killing our children, but we will never [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1839.6599999999999s)]
*  forgive them for making us kill their children. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1843.26s)]
*  Kill their children. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1845.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1846.46s)]
*  So I said, we will never forgive the Israeli right-wing government for making us take their [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1847.46s)]
*  elderly as hostages. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1851.54s)]
*  So the nuanced language that I use is a way much more diplomatic and civilized and less [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1853.26s)]
*  provoking than her words. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1860.18s)]
*  I use the word kidnapping and not killing. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1861.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1864.0600000000002s)]
*  Yet, going back to empathy, going back to, you know, treating each other on equal basis, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1865.0600000000002s)]
*  yes, the words are provoking. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1872.8600000000001s)]
*  But can you imagine how provocative her words were to me as a Palestinian for the past decades? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  She's not a professor of conflict resolution. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1882.38s)]
*  Oh, when I become the prime minister of Palestine, I promise you, you won't hear me say such [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1884.3000000000002s)]
*  things. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1889.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1890.94s)]
*  But I mean, what was the, who's us here? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1891.94s)]
*  You know, the Palestinians. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1895.78s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1896.78s)]
*  Let's not. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1897.78s)]
*  But Hamas, is Hamas the representative of the Palestinians? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1898.78s)]
*  When October 7th happened, was it Hamas doing it or was it the Palestinians doing it? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1901.22s)]
*  Because I've been telling people it wasn't the Palestinians, it was Hamas. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1905.46s)]
*  And then you're tweeting this and you're saying, no, it was us. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1908.62s)]
*  Listen, he is again trying to spin everything around Hamas and that is something that I [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1912.42s)]
*  again dejected. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1917.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1918.9399999999998s)]
*  This is an Israeli-Palestinian thing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1919.9399999999998s)]
*  This is not against Hamas. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1922.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not a fan of Hamas. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1923.58s)]
*  Let's not elude to really things that are not constructive in this conversation. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1925.26s)]
*  Hamas did the attack. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1930.62s)]
*  However, I'm speaking about the Palestinian people. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1932.62s)]
*  We have a right. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1935.3s)]
*  We've been suffering from the Israeli military occupation for so long and it should not be [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1936.3s)]
*  tolerated that this military occupation continues to cause us injustices in 2024. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1940.6999999999998s)]
*  While everybody knows and the war crimes are documented on the screens, nobody should remain [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1946.86s)]
*  silent. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1951.78s)]
*  We don't have a ceasefire until this moment. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1952.78s)]
*  While children in Gaza, not only, you know, 14,000 children have perished, 17,000 have [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1955.54s)]
*  lost their parents, let alone the 10,000 who are imputated, who lost their limbs. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1963.1399999999999s)]
*  So what kind of future? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1969.1799999999998s)]
*  Really, what kind of... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1971.18s)]
*  If we are talking about a conflict resolution, a future, peaceful days ahead, what kind of [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1972.18s)]
*  mentality are we expecting from those children when they grow up in 15 years' time? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1979.58s)]
*  To be forgiving? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1985.86s)]
*  To be empathetic? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1987.34s)]
*  Violence can only breed violence. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1989.98s)]
*  But let me also add that violence of the weak is called terror and violence of the strong [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1992.66s)]
*  is referred to as war against terror, unfortunately. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=1999.5s)]
*  When violence is rewarded, things can only get worse. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2003.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's why we are here at this moment in the Middle East now. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2007.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2010.4199999999998s)]
*  It's the Israeli military occupation that I blame for the existing atrocities that we [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2011.4199999999998s)]
*  are suffering. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2015.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2016.86s)]
*  So, I mean, you've made it clear that in your view, the atrocities are a result of the occupation. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2017.86s)]
*  What I'm trying to understand is if you think that it was legitimate resistance, if you're [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2028.14s)]
*  trying to justify it or if you're trying to just explain it. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2034.14s)]
*  Listen, you're speaking to a mother. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2037.42s)]
*  I have three children. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2040.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2041.5s)]
*  To a woman who is very proud of her feminist identity. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2042.5s)]
*  And to a professor of diplomacy, Tarek. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2045.74s)]
*  Yes, this is a very diplomatic tweet. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2048.62s)]
*  But I can never justify violence. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2050.7000000000003s)]
*  I can never justify violence against no matter who, no matter when. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2053.26s)]
*  But I'm also obliged to remind you that Hamas was created in the late 80s. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2057.86s)]
*  The Israeli occupation started way before. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2064.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2067.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2068.26s)]
*  You know, so the last thing we agreed we would talk about is this other, I think this was [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2069.26s)]
*  an Instagram post that was on... [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2073.78s)]
*  A response to Sheryl Stanford. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2075.9s)]
*  And what I did is, so this is how it looks online, but what I've done is I've just made [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2079.14s)]
*  the presentation a little bit easier for people to read. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2083.5s)]
*  So what's happening here? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2087.02s)]
*  Well, I want your attention, guys. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2088.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2092.9s)]
*  Well, I assume you all know Sheryl Sandberg. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2093.9s)]
*  She... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2096.78s)]
*  I've never... [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2097.78s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2098.78s)]
*  No, just... [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2099.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2100.78s)]
*  I think it was important to put her post to see how I reacted. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2101.78s)]
*  I couldn't find it. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2105.22s)]
*  I just could find on your... [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2106.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2108.82s)]
*  Anyway, she was the one who actually led the campaigns from the US in plight and in defense [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2109.82s)]
*  of women's rights on the Israeli side. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2116.7s)]
*  So what I said that, yes, we're all 100% as women against rape and against violence by [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2120.02s)]
*  all means, against humanity. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2126.3799999999997s)]
*  But I also tried to remind her, because I am one of her circles, of the Lenin circles, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2129.3799999999997s)]
*  Ardala Al-Araqat for more than 16 years now. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2133.8999999999996s)]
*  I have never ever heard her voice when it came to the suffering and the injustices of [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2136.62s)]
*  the Palestinian woman, for example. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2141.14s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's not only rape. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2144.38s)]
*  And there are documented, of course, international UN reports on rape against Palestinian women [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2146.7000000000003s)]
*  from the Israeli military occupation. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2152.34s)]
*  But there is also 40 Palestinian women are now behind Israeli bars. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2154.14s)]
*  There are 55,000 Palestinian pregnant women in Gaza right now. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2160.9s)]
*  55,000 Palestinian women pregnant, deprived of the basic, you know, visits to doctors, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2168.06s)]
*  ecosystem to check on the baby, the hygiene environment, let alone the ceiling to give [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2174.22s)]
*  birth under. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2181.74s)]
*  So I was really outraged and provoked by Sheryl Sandberg, who spoke up that loudly, but never [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2184.2599999999998s)]
*  came to speak on behalf of the other women who are suffering on a daily basis. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2192.14s)]
*  You know, Palestinian women suffering is not only sexual. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2197.74s)]
*  It's also, you know, when we stand against violence against women, it has so many layers. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2202.9399999999996s)]
*  Can I tell you, as a mother myself, who is considered to be very privileged Palestinian, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2210.1s)]
*  I'm a professor, I'm young, I travel, I teach, I'm, you know, from the middle class, if I [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2214.06s)]
*  may say, however, as a woman, as a mother, if I want to plan a visit for my kids to go [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2220.7s)]
*  and visit their grandma over the weekend, I have to pass at least two checkpoints from [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2227.1s)]
*  Ramallah to Jericho, which is 40 minutes away. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2233.94s)]
*  On the checkpoints, my three kids sitting in the backseat will have to face the Israeli [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2237.06s)]
*  soldiers pointing the guns at their faces while they check my ID and check the trunk [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2242.02s)]
*  and interrogate me and ask me different questions. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2247.74s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2250.86s)]
*  And I really want the world to speak that this is not normal for Palestinian women, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2252.98s)]
*  let alone the detention, the arbitrary detention. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2257.4s)]
*  You know that Israel is the one and only country in the world that practices administrative [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  detention, which is basically they can detain, they can arrest, they can keep in custody [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2265.7s)]
*  without trials. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2270.38s)]
*  Every six months they renew it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2271.38s)]
*  Have you ever been to Egypt? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2272.86s)]
*  And it's happened, no, but I mean, listen, we're talking about the democracy of the Middle [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2274.34s)]
*  East, Tarek. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2279.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2280.38s)]
*  Please. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2281.38s)]
*  So, so, so sorry. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2282.78s)]
*  Please, there will be time for questions afterwards. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2284.82s)]
*  No, but think about women. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2286.7000000000003s)]
*  I also want to tell you and share with you that there are more than 140 Palestinian women [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2287.82s)]
*  today who are waiting for the bodies of their sons and daughters to be retrieved from Israeli [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2293.62s)]
*  refrigerators. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2301.98s)]
*  Those are the bodies of the martyrs of the Palestinians who are kept in the laps of Tel [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2302.98s)]
*  Aviv University. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2309.58s)]
*  Can you imagine, you know, the credibility? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2311.58s)]
*  Please, Tarek, they need to know those facts in case they don't know them. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2313.74s)]
*  They enjoy amazing reputation, the Israeli universities. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2317.98s)]
*  And my cousin is one of those bodies, by the way. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2322.7799999999997s)]
*  So my auntie, my uncle's wife is suffering until this moment. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2326.98s)]
*  All she asks for now, three years later, my cousin was murdered in June 2020 on his sister's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2331.2999999999997s)]
*  wedding day. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2337.78s)]
*  He was 26 years old, in a love affair, an athlete. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2338.78s)]
*  He had a small business, nothing related to Hamas, very liberal. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2341.98s)]
*  They decided to terminate his life with six bullets in three seconds just because they [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2346.38s)]
*  thought he posed danger on the checkpoint. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2351.38s)]
*  Listen, I wanted to take it, I want to say more. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2353.78s)]
*  Even if he really, I want to say, to go into that scenario, if he really posed that threat, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2357.94s)]
*  two bullets in his legs would have been enough. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2364.1800000000003s)]
*  But not to terminate his life. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2367.5s)]
*  However, the sad story doesn't end here. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2369.1s)]
*  The sad story is that my uncle and his wife today don't want to hold the criminals accountable. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2371.7s)]
*  This is not what they're asking today. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2377.1s)]
*  All they ask is to bury their son with dignity and to bid farewell. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2379.98s)]
*  This should not be tolerated in 2024. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2387.02s)]
*  Let alone that he's innocent, of course. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2388.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2391.5s)]
*  So you're not going to get any argument from me about the injustices of the occupation. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2392.66s)]
*  A defender of Israel's conduct in the occupation might say, look, these things aren't happening [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2399.94s)]
*  because Israelis just hate Palestinians. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2405.54s)]
*  They're happening because there is violence and there is terror that Palestinians perpetrate. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2408.38s)]
*  See October 7th. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2415.34s)]
*  And so there is this kind of endless cycle that we could go on and on about. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2417.3s)]
*  The question is, how do we get out of it? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2423.82s)]
*  But I just want to before we, and I want to spend time on that, just very quickly on this [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2425.34s)]
*  one, you are not saying the rapes didn't happen in this tweet. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2429.86s)]
*  Who am I to say so? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2434.9s)]
*  Investigations, you know, legal tools can investigate, do rigorous investigations and [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2437.1400000000003s)]
*  then decide. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2442.5800000000004s)]
*  None of us is actually entitled to just claim things or mislead audiences or use propaganda [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2444.06s)]
*  just to make things seem horrific or to export ugly scenes. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2451.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, because the UN has said that there is credible evidence of... [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2455.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't say no. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2460.66s)]
*  Can I ask one last question just before you? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2461.66s)]
*  You've said this word before and you just said it earlier today. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2464.5s)]
*  You say don't fall into a hasbara. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2469.06s)]
*  What is that? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2470.9s)]
*  This is the Israeli media machine that is very well invested and that is actually administered [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2472.9s)]
*  by the prime minister's office himself. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2481.78s)]
*  And it's very well connected to all the different offices at the ministerial levels. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2483.94s)]
*  They... [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2489.3s)]
*  And you know, I applaud them actually for this machine because for decades they have [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2490.78s)]
*  been... [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2494.7000000000003s)]
*  What propaganda you mean? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2495.7000000000003s)]
*  You can call it propaganda in English. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2497.82s)]
*  Why do you use the word... [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2501.14s)]
*  Why don't you just call it propaganda? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2502.14s)]
*  Why do you use the word hasbara? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2503.58s)]
*  Because it's a terminology that exists on the Israeli media machinery. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2504.58s)]
*  You know, I think... [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2509.18s)]
*  If you just think about... [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2511.42s)]
*  Accusing the Israelis of engaging in propaganda versus accusing them of engaging in hasbara. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2514.42s)]
*  I think of when Muslim politicians are criticized in this country by, for lack of a better word, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2522.02s)]
*  Islamophobes, people who don't like Muslims. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2529.9s)]
*  They'll say, oh, they're... [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2531.58s)]
*  If a Muslim politician is lying, they'll say, oh, that guy is engaging in taqiyah, as if [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2533.5s)]
*  there's like a special Muslim kind of lying. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2537.3s)]
*  And I feel like... [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2541.18s)]
*  And I experienced that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2542.46s)]
*  I would much rather you say that guy's lying. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2543.46s)]
*  It doesn't feel Islamophobic when you say the guy's lying. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2545.42s)]
*  Why do you use that special term? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2548.72s)]
*  Why don't you just say they're engaging in propaganda? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2550.06s)]
*  Listen, I'm not saying that they're lying, but I'm saying that they are trying to spread [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2551.74s)]
*  opinions. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2556.22s)]
*  And meritless opinions without any fact, without any documented resources. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2559.14s)]
*  That's the only thing I am talking about. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2565.66s)]
*  And they have been successful, very successful. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2568.7s)]
*  We have been portrayed as Palestinians as being terrorists, as the ones who are causing [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2571.62s)]
*  the violence. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2577.18s)]
*  While we all know that for more than seven decades, we have been suffering and the war [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2578.18s)]
*  crimes have been documented and still Israel is enjoying every impunity possible. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2582.46s)]
*  She's not Muslim. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2587.42s)]
*  She's Christian. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2588.42s)]
*  She's American. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2589.42s)]
*  She's a fine journalist, very professional. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2590.42s)]
*  When they murdered my own cousin, when they decided to label six human rights organizations [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2593.78s)]
*  as terrorists, they come up with a certain narrative and they spread it around with the [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2599.7400000000002s)]
*  help of the biased Western media. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2605.38s)]
*  Allow me to say so. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2607.46s)]
*  Without any documented truth, without any facts, and they manage to mislead the audiences. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2609.86s)]
*  It's about time we stop this war against truth. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2615.22s)]
*  It's about time we, and I urge you always, even for things that I just said, don't call [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2619.7799999999997s)]
*  me a liar, but go do your investigation. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2625.58s)]
*  Do your research after what I had shared with you today. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2628.7799999999997s)]
*  And then allow yourself to judge. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2631.8199999999997s)]
*  You don't need to take my opinion. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2635.02s)]
*  As I said, we're not here to teach you what to think, but we're here to urge you and provoke [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2636.54s)]
*  your thinking. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2641.8599999999997s)]
*  Dr. DeLell, one thing that you noted about Sheryl Sandberg and why Sheryl Sandberg's [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2643.5s)]
*  Instagram post was so wounding to you as somebody who'd been a member of her group is that it [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2651.9s)]
*  seemed to lack empathy with the suffering of the Palestinians. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2656.98s)]
*  And I kind of want to zoom out from the conversation about tweets and just get your take as a scholar [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2663.26s)]
*  of conflict resolution. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2669.26s)]
*  When I, the first image of October 7th that I saw was of the Hamas fighters driving around [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2670.7s)]
*  with the body of that poor woman whose name I'm forgetting. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2680.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2685.7s)]
*  Shani Luq or was it Abu Abduhsh? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2686.7s)]
*  Okay, sorry. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2690.7s)]
*  There were two then women who were subject to something. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2692.54s)]
*  This is the dead body that I'm referring to. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2695.62s)]
*  And the almost joy or glee that ordinary citizens seem to be greeting these Hamas fighters who [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2700.62s)]
*  had with them the palpable evidence of an atrocity. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2708.86s)]
*  And then I saw the other image that gives me great sadness is image of Israelis lining [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2712.9s)]
*  up deck chairs to watch and applaud the bombing of Gaza as if it's some kind of movie. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2720.12s)]
*  And both of those scenes speak to me of a very deep lack of empathy on the part of these [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  two people who from this day till the day of judgment are going to be living together. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2732.16s)]
*  And so I guess the question I want to ask you is as a scholar of conflict resolution, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2736.16s)]
*  as a scholar, how do we get out of this? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2740.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, shouldn't doesn't it have to start with empathy with the other side? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2745.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm not going to I'm not going to then say to you and therefore shouldn't you be [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2750.12s)]
*  more empathetic? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not going there. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  But how do we establish empathy? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2755.2799999999997s)]
*  I think we really need responsible leadership, responsible leaders. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2759.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay, who just stop that atrocity that I go into should just do an immediate ceasefire [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2767.12s)]
*  because you just argued, for example, that if Hamas releases the hostages, then everything [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2773.9599999999996s)]
*  will be over. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2779.8799999999997s)]
*  In fact, in fact, and I hate to speak on behalf of Hamas, I'm not here to speak on behalf [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2781.3999999999996s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2785.9599999999996s)]
*  Hamas had been saying ever since the first weeks of the negotiations, complete ceasefire [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2786.9599999999996s)]
*  for the release of the hostages. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2795.9599999999996s)]
*  They should get everything they want. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2798.48s)]
*  Listen, Tarek, it is about, you know, being it's about common sense. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2800.68s)]
*  So if it's okay for you to have a permanently ceasefire for the Israeli troops to relax [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2805.48s)]
*  for a week or two, and then they can continue to murdering and shelling the Palestinian [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  civilians, this should also be not okay. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2815.52s)]
*  Why aren't you calling on Hamas to surrender? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2818.12s)]
*  Give up the hostages and surrender. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2821.08s)]
*  Get out of the country. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2822.56s)]
*  And then? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2823.56s)]
*  And then we'll then we should talk about and then but I would love to talk about that. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2824.88s)]
*  Is it your stipulation that if Hamas today said, here are all the hostages and we're [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2828.84s)]
*  leaving, we're going to... [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2833.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you really believe that, seriously speaking, now I'm addressing your brains now, please. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you really compare the military might of Hamas to the Israeli military might? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2840.76s)]
*  No. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2845.92s)]
*  Do you really see that there is really equal combat on the ground? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2846.92s)]
*  Do you really think that wouldn't end everything right now if Hamas said unconditionally that [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2850.0s)]
*  we're leaving? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2854.5600000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2855.5600000000004s)]
*  I tell you why. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2856.5600000000004s)]
*  For the past 30 years, the Middle East has been going under what is so called the peace [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2857.56s)]
*  process. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2863.2799999999997s)]
*  The PLO had recognized the Israeli state so many times. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2864.2799999999997s)]
*  They had given up on 78% of mandated Palestine. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2869.7999999999997s)]
*  This map. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2875.16s)]
*  Just to show that the PLO and the Palestinians really want a better and more peaceful, sustainable, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2876.16s)]
*  strategic future for the Palestinians and the Israelis alike in the Middle East. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2883.16s)]
*  We believed in dialogue, in diplomacy, in negotiations. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2887.96s)]
*  Our leaders promised us dignity, freedom, statehood, independence. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2892.3199999999997s)]
*  30 years later, all we witnessed is a more entrenched Israeli military occupation and [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2897.12s)]
*  more settler colonialism. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2904.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, Israel would say... [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2905.6s)]
*  No, hold on. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2908.04s)]
*  Why do you want me and yourself to trust Netanyahu who is still repeating at every opportunity [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2910.08s)]
*  possible that he is against peace, he is against the two-state solution, and he said bluntly [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2915.48s)]
*  yes to annexation and settlements? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2921.48s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2923.2799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2924.2799999999997s)]
*  We want the two-state solution, but this should be put on the lab of Netanyahu. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2925.2799999999997s)]
*  No, 100%. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2931.48s)]
*  But you are making it seem as if the last several decades have been ones in which the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2933.0s)]
*  Israelis have only entrenched their occupation. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2938.16s)]
*  You're not talking about the peace deals that were offered that were rejected. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2942.12s)]
*  There could have been a Palestinian state. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2946.32s)]
*  Listen, I did a research on Camp David. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2948.12s)]
*  I interviewed all of the Israeli negotiators, Palestinian negotiators, and the American [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2951.0s)]
*  negotiators. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2956.44s)]
*  And my research is published now. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2958.68s)]
*  It's under the theory of coercive diplomacy again. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2961.84s)]
*  The Palestinians have always been coerced to the maximum to serve the best interests [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2965.5600000000004s)]
*  of the Israelis. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2970.7200000000003s)]
*  There was no written proposal at Camp David, guys. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2973.2400000000002s)]
*  Please go read my research. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2977.0s)]
*  Go speak to the negotiators who are still alive. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2978.92s)]
*  You know who agrees with you on that is actually Jared Kushner, who said the same thing in [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2981.8s)]
*  his book. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2985.4s)]
*  The dealmaker who has nothing to do with states. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2986.4s)]
*  So I want to make sure that we have time to get to questions. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2991.52s)]
*  But I guess what I... [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2996.52s)]
*  You have the photo of the woman. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2997.52s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=2999.52s)]
*  You had a photo that you wanted me to show. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3000.52s)]
*  Can I ask one question, then we can show the photo and then you can tell. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3002.68s)]
*  So you talked about all... [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  Graphics, right? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3007.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3008.04s)]
*  You talked about all of the negotiators that you interviewed for your paper. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3009.04s)]
*  I'm assuming that one of them was, if you permit me to mention, your late father, Asa'i [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3012.28s)]
*  Barakat, who was, in case people don't know, a senior Palestinian negotiator. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3019.9199999999996s)]
*  He is often referred to as the architect of the Oslo Accords. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3026.56s)]
*  He was a senior fellow here at the Belfer Center with Nick Burns back in 2020 before [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3032.02s)]
*  his untimely passing. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I think if I... [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3041.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm very thrilled to be sitting with the daughter of Asa'i Barakat, who's a scholar in her own [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3044.7999999999997s)]
*  But if I were sitting with Asa'i Barakat, the architect of Oslo, I might ask him, how [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3049.12s)]
*  would you architect us out of this? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3054.4s)]
*  How can we make a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians where the Palestinians [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3056.2400000000002s)]
*  can achieve their right of self-determination and the Israelis can be assured that October [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3061.8s)]
*  7th won't happen again? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3068.2400000000002s)]
*  And how would you answer that question? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3070.1600000000003s)]
*  Some might find Tarek's question unprofessional. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3072.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I'm very, very proud of being the daughter of Asa'i Barakat. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3075.28s)]
*  My dad has devoted all his life to the path of diplomacy, negotiations, and peace talks. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3079.0s)]
*  He promised me and my generation that he would bring us statehood, independence, sovereignty, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3089.0s)]
*  dignity, freedom. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3095.84s)]
*  Yes, he was the chief Palestinian negotiator for so long. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3097.84s)]
*  But sadly enough, my father had to leave the earth without realizing his dreams, without [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3102.28s)]
*  delivering to me what he promised me. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3110.1200000000003s)]
*  This is the sad reality that I want the peers of my father, the ones who are still negotiating [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3115.0s)]
*  on the Israeli side, and on the American side, and on the Palestinian side, to not just leave [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3120.32s)]
*  the world without realizing that dream for our kids and our generations. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3126.76s)]
*  You just mentioned the architect of Oslo. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3132.6s)]
*  I need to correct that fact. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3135.8799999999997s)]
*  One of the architects. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3138.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3139.3599999999997s)]
*  Let me just... [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3140.52s)]
*  There is big confusion. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3141.52s)]
*  That's why I think I owe you this explanation. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3143.72s)]
*  When the Palestinian negotiators went to Madrid in 1991, there was a Palestine insider's delegation. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3147.8799999999997s)]
*  When I say insiders, I mean the Palestinians residing inside Palestine. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3154.2s)]
*  So then the PLO has designated Haider Abdel Shafi from Gaza, who was the chief of the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3159.64s)]
*  delegation, and Saeb Arakat, who was an academic at Al-Najah University in Nablus, and Hanan [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3166.44s)]
*  Ashrawi, who was an academic at Birzeit University, and Faisal Al-Husseini from Jerusalem. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3173.4s)]
*  So those four were the Palestinian insider delegation who were supposed to be the official [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3178.96s)]
*  Palestinian delegation negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3185.84s)]
*  When the Oslo talks happened and when they started being leaked in the news, those four [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  insider negotiations had no clue about the secret track that was taking place on Oslo. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3198.2000000000003s)]
*  I asked my own father. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3205.96s)]
*  I told him, how did you feel as being designated as the official Palestinian negotiating on [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3207.6800000000003s)]
*  behalf of the Palestinian people while you had no idea about a back channel that was [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3214.2s)]
*  being conducted for that long without you knowing? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3219.92s)]
*  And he did not try to share with me. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3225.3599999999997s)]
*  He said, listen, it was very disappointing at that moment. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3227.44s)]
*  It was a shocking moment to all of us as the Palestinian negotiators. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3232.44s)]
*  He told me before judging, I asked the PLO architect, who is actually Mahmoud Abbas, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3238.2000000000003s)]
*  our current president, Abu Mazen. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3245.88s)]
*  He is the one who negotiated Oslo and not the Palestinian insider delegation. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3248.6000000000004s)]
*  I think this is a fact that needs to be documented for the generations who are dealing with negotiations. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3253.6800000000003s)]
*  But I want to also share with you that he told me as I looked at the document on the [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3257.96s)]
*  first page and when I saw that the Israeli government recognizing the PLO, for him, as [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3262.44s)]
*  he told me, that was a big, big achievement because then the PLO was considered, like [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3269.44s)]
*  Hamas today, a terrorist organization. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3275.44s)]
*  So for him, that was a big, big victory on the negotiating side. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3278.1200000000003s)]
*  However, he had shared with me that the most difficult setback that he found in the document [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3282.84s)]
*  was the lack of mention on settlements because he knew that it is a settler colonial project [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3290.76s)]
*  because he knew that settlements stand as the main obstacle to any peaceful resolution [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3297.76s)]
*  in the future. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3302.44s)]
*  However, Hadar Abdel Shafi, at that time, he resigned because he wanted to protest the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3303.44s)]
*  fact that he didn't know there was a back channel. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3309.08s)]
*  Saeb Ariqat, Hanan Ashrawi, and Faisal Husseini thought, no, the Palestinian cause need them, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3311.48s)]
*  the negotiations need them, and that they would continue to serve the best interests [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3317.28s)]
*  of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause, hoping to bring amendments to the future [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3321.0s)]
*  drafts. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3327.32s)]
*  I mean, I have to say, I'm very glad for that historical corrective because I have to say, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3328.32s)]
*  I have always felt that the component of Oslo that resulted in leadership of the Palestinians [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3333.6800000000003s)]
*  being put in the hands of the PLO and of Yasser Arafat was a great setback. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3340.1200000000003s)]
*  When I was a kid, I remember in Saudi Arabia, the first time I saw Abba Eban, who had been [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3345.84s)]
*  the Israeli Foreign Minister. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3353.2400000000002s)]
*  He speaks in the Queen's English, he looks like more of a Harvard professor than I do, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3354.48s)]
*  certainly. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3359.04s)]
*  I remember thinking as a young Arab who wanted Palestinian freedom, I remember feeling so [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3360.04s)]
*  depressed. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3365.6800000000003s)]
*  I was like, look at who the Israelis have. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3366.6800000000003s)]
*  The Israelis have Abba Eban. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3368.32s)]
*  That guy is formidable intellect. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3370.0s)]
*  What do we have? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3372.6800000000003s)]
*  We have Yasser Arafat. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3373.6800000000003s)]
*  And then when I saw your father, when I saw Hanan Asherawi, Faisal Husseini, Haider Abdel [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3375.04s)]
*  Shafi, I thought at Madrid negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians, university professors, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3381.0s)]
*  physicians, I thought, okay, that's the leadership of the Palestinians. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3387.24s)]
*  That's the Palestinians, Abba Eban. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3391.24s)]
*  And I've asked Hanan Asherawi this question, you can find it on YouTube. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3394.4s)]
*  Why did you guys so willingly surrender leadership of this to the PLO? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3398.56s)]
*  I felt like Oslo was the Americans and the Israelis saying to the Palestinians, here's [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3406.88s)]
*  your Arab dictator, now be governed like every other Arab dictatorship. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3411.32s)]
*  And one of the reasons I liked you, and still do, is because when I met you in Ramallah, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3415.24s)]
*  did seem to be saying that this is a big part of the problem that Palestinians have, that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3423.4s)]
*  the Palestinians do not have the legitimate democratic leadership that can effectively [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3429.2799999999997s)]
*  represent them. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3435.36s)]
*  And I felt that you were somebody who was starting from taking agency, that to end the [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3437.6s)]
*  occupation, we must first end the authoritarianism. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3444.96s)]
*  And then we'll be able to have representatives of the Palestinian people who can sit across [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3448.44s)]
*  the table from the Israelis and credibly say, I'm not just some Qatari or Iranian-funded [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3453.92s)]
*  terrorist group, or I'm not some client of the Americans and the Israelis that's being [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3459.4s)]
*  held afloat by them, i.e. Fatah, but rather I'm the legitimate representative of the Palestinian [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3465.28s)]
*  people. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3469.88s)]
*  Am I wrong in thinking that's got to be the first step? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3470.88s)]
*  You keep saying the first step is better leadership on the Israeli side. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3474.8s)]
*  Isn't it better, more democratically legitimate leadership on the Palestinian side? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3478.04s)]
*  The first step is ending the Israeli military occupation, instead of just leadership. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3482.2000000000003s)]
*  It's about international will, international community. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3486.04s)]
*  Everybody who advocates for a two-state solution should be calling for the end of the Israeli [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3488.44s)]
*  military occupation, should be asking to define the border of the state of Israel, should [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3492.0800000000004s)]
*  be recognizing the Palestinian state. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3495.88s)]
*  Leadership is also a necessity. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3498.04s)]
*  However, I do realize as a Palestinian that we have a lot of internal setbacks. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3499.56s)]
*  Yes, we deserve better, we need democracy, we need elections, and we need a better leadership [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3504.36s)]
*  that is reflective of the capacities and the capabilities of the Palestinian youth, the [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3509.44s)]
*  Palestinian women, the Palestinian know-how. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3515.08s)]
*  We have really much better, we could look much more attractive and much more appealing [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3517.4s)]
*  to normalization deals with the Palestinians rather than with the Israelis in the soon [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3521.12s)]
*  future. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3525.44s)]
*  However, just because you so much of Arafat, can I just say one thing when we study history? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3526.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3535.96s)]
*  That for a freedom fighter to convert and shift his strategy from being a freedom fighter [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3536.96s)]
*  to being a negotiator and a peacemaker, we should all be applauding Yasser Arafat for [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3546.08s)]
*  that. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3551.88s)]
*  Self-interest. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3552.88s)]
*  We should all be applauding him for that. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3553.88s)]
*  Why do you say self-interest? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3554.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3556.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3557.32s)]
*  The Israeli decision-makers are still choosing rockets and missiles and fire and war crimes [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3558.32s)]
*  and they're still shelling the Palestinian civilians and children in Gaza. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3564.12s)]
*  They do not choose to go for peaceful resolution. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3567.76s)]
*  They're still saying that we have all the right to defend ourselves, defend yourselves [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  while justifying the killings and the murders. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3575.36s)]
*  Guys, this is not Dala Al-Araqat speaking about a denicidal act in Gaza. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3578.52s)]
*  The ICJ that rules for plausibility of Israel in committing genocide in 2024. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3583.52s)]
*  You know, I'm a professor and a comparative approach of learning is really important to [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3591.1600000000003s)]
*  be adopted nowadays. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3595.92s)]
*  The Holocaust has been taught and we have learned the Holocaust as being the crime of [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3597.84s)]
*  the crimes against humanity in the 20th century. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3604.08s)]
*  We should learn from it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3607.6800000000003s)]
*  We should say never again to all humanity, whether for any religion, any color, any ideology, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3609.36s)]
*  including those in Gaza. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3616.2000000000003s)]
*  It should not be tolerated. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3618.0s)]
*  It should not be okay. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3619.56s)]
*  You know, all the legal tools that were created were created just after the Holocaust to make [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3620.56s)]
*  sure that we say never again. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  That we stop violence. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3628.48s)]
*  We stop bloodshed. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3629.52s)]
*  So I mean, obviously somebody could and you almost certainly will in the Q&A here, people [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3632.1200000000003s)]
*  take issue with that equation of Israel's response to October 7th and the Holocaust. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3636.66s)]
*  I mean, but you had asked me to show a slide. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3642.18s)]
*  So let me pull it up and then I'm going to open it up for questions. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3646.7s)]
*  So. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3649.22s)]
*  This is me in the middle. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3651.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3652.8999999999996s)]
*  And gathered with me is around 80 Palestinian women in Gaza. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3653.8999999999996s)]
*  This picture was taken on the 19th of September 2023. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3659.8199999999997s)]
*  Less than three weeks before October 7th. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3664.46s)]
*  This is the kickoff meeting for what was supposed to be tomorrow, the Palestinian Women's Summit [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3668.7s)]
*  taking place in Palestine. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3674.84s)]
*  You know what is really sad? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3676.46s)]
*  I'm sure the majority of you don't know that there are Palestinian beautiful women in Gaza [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3681.06s)]
*  who hold businesses and startups and are academics and engineers and writers and some of them [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3686.06s)]
*  are artists and dancers and singers. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3693.94s)]
*  But the sad story for me is that because I am the founding president of the Palestine [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3697.06s)]
*  Business and Professional Women Network and this was an effort to bring together the Palestinian [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3701.66s)]
*  women from Gaza and the West Bank together in this summit. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3706.58s)]
*  Most of those women have been massacred, let alone the businesses, the infrastructure, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3710.54s)]
*  the homes, the families that they had lost. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3716.26s)]
*  So again what I'm trying to share with you today, as much as I want to be academic and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3718.7799999999997s)]
*  civilized and human and women, speaking of all the different rights for the civilization [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3724.2599999999998s)]
*  and for humanity today, the sufferings that we have to deal with, the traumas that we [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3731.4599999999996s)]
*  have to deal with are beyond your imagination. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3737.62s)]
*  So as I was myself putting that effort and all those women were amazingly enthusiastic [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3742.06s)]
*  about holding the Palestinian Women Summit. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3747.94s)]
*  Look how civilized are the Palestinian women. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3749.94s)]
*  We wanted to connect with women from all around the world in showing the brand of Palestine [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3752.38s)]
*  through the women's eyes. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3758.14s)]
*  We wanted to become as a brand for Palestine. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3759.82s)]
*  Yet who hindered that possibility? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3762.1800000000003s)]
*  The Israeli military occupation continues to hinder every other opportunity we seek [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3764.82s)]
*  to get seen to bring about a better future for us on the individual level or on the collective level. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3770.58s)]
*  Alright, so Dr. Delilah, I could ask so many more questions. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3776.66s)]
*  Thank you for sharing that and I hope that this bloodshed that is happening right now [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3779.9s)]
*  will come to an end soon. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3785.1s)]
*  Let's take some questions. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3786.7799999999997s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3787.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, and so I'm going to first start by calling on some of my students and then we'll [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3788.7799999999997s)]
*  open it up to the rest of the audience as has become our practice. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3791.9s)]
*  So the first question I will call on Maya Ilani. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3796.18s)]
*  If Maya is here. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3800.38s)]
*  Oh, there she is. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3801.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3802.38s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us and for this talk. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3806.98s)]
*  My question is, you've been, in this talk and in other writings, been very critical [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3811.02s)]
*  about the failure of the international community to protect and to defend Palestinian human [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3816.2599999999998s)]
*  rights but also sovereignty and self-determination. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3822.7799999999997s)]
*  And my question to you is not so much about the past but about the future. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3828.62s)]
*  There are at least two great powers in the world right now, the US and the UK, that have [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3832.2999999999997s)]
*  been rumoured to talk about recognising a Palestinian state but in the 67 borders. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3837.22s)]
*  And I know that you've also previously said that you think the two-state solution is dead [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3844.66s)]
*  and it's only a one-state solution. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3847.62s)]
*  No? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3849.8199999999997s)]
*  I saw an interview. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3850.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3851.8199999999997s)]
*  But my question is, do you think that would be a useful step forward to protect, for the [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3852.8199999999997s)]
*  international community to take in the 67 border or does it need to be the entire territory [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3858.86s)]
*  from the Jordan River to the sea for it to be effective? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3864.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you want to answer immediately or would it take... [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3867.26s)]
*  What do you prefer? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3870.1800000000003s)]
*  You want to take a cut or you want to answer immediately? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3871.1800000000003s)]
*  Better answer, no? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3873.94s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3874.94s)]
*  Sure. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3875.94s)]
*  La'at faddali. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3876.94s)]
*  Thank you, Maya. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3877.94s)]
*  Well, the international community has, every member state of the international community [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3878.94s)]
*  has legal and ethical obligations when it comes to maintaining security and peace, not [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3883.86s)]
*  only for the Palestinians but for all humanity. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3888.22s)]
*  They also have an obligation to stop the genocide, according to the ICJ and the Genocide Convention. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3890.7799999999997s)]
*  They also have an obligation to stop the forced eviction orders that we have been seeing in [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3898.02s)]
*  Gaza. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3903.1s)]
*  Because in Gaza, people are now suffocated in Rafah in hopes that those people will flee [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3904.1s)]
*  into Sinai. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3910.94s)]
*  And this is the Israeli project that was literally spelled out in the Israeli Military Intelligence [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3912.3399999999997s)]
*  Plan that was leaked on the 13th of October. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3917.54s)]
*  For those of you who haven't seen it, please go Google it on 972, which is an Israeli media [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3920.42s)]
*  outlet. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3924.18s)]
*  They want to forcibly evict the Palestinian people, empty the land, ethnically cleanse [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3925.18s)]
*  us and then annex the rest of the land. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3930.74s)]
*  However, talking about the two-state solution, one lesson I can share with you as a professor [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3933.66s)]
*  of conflict resolution is that negotiations is only one tool to the alternative dispute [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3939.74s)]
*  resolution tools. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3947.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, the world has been dealing with negotiations as if it is the end in itself. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3948.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not really the concern of one versus two or the shape of the solution as long as [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3954.8999999999996s)]
*  we talk about equal rights, human rights, dignity and freedom. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3964.8599999999997s)]
*  However, I am, as Zalal Ayyarqat, an advocate for the Palestinian right of self-determination. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3970.58s)]
*  The two-state solution is the best-case scenario for the two peoples to live strategically [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3976.78s)]
*  in peace and security. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3981.02s)]
*  However, if Israel continues to reject the two-state solution and if we tolerate seeing [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3982.6600000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu going to the UN back in September holding that map of Israel from the river [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3988.6600000000003s)]
*  to the sea, negating any possibility for any Palestinian state, if he doesn't want it, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=3993.2200000000003s)]
*  then yes, why not for one state where everybody has equal rights? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4000.1800000000003s)]
*  But to continue to advocate for the two-state solution from the different members of the [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4005.66s)]
*  international community while only they procrastinate and buy time for Israel and the right-wing [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4010.54s)]
*  Israeli government to confiscate more lands, build more settlements and deprive the Palestinians, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4016.2599999999998s)]
*  suffocate them and murder them on a daily basis, this should not be tolerated. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4020.8599999999997s)]
*  And we should not expect the Palestinians to just remain silent. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4024.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4028.94s)]
*  Roy. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4029.94s)]
*  Professor Masoud, thank you for the opportunity. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4030.94s)]
*  I came here open-minded. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4037.26s)]
*  I don't believe anymore in the integrity of Dr. Ayyarqat, so I've withdrawn my question. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4038.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4045.02s)]
*  Mirav. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4046.02s)]
*  It's very democratic, so you can feel free to leave the room if you want to. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4047.02s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4051.98s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4052.98s)]
*  Mirav. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4053.98s)]
*  On that side over there. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4054.98s)]
*  Right there. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4058.7400000000002s)]
*  Sam? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4059.7400000000002s)]
*  Hi. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4061.54s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4062.54s)]
*  I live in a village near Kfosabafir. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4066.8999999999996s)]
*  You that are not familiar with the area, it's the narrowest part between the Green Line [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4070.8599999999997s)]
*  and the sea in Israel. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4077.54s)]
*  My home is, the distance between my home and the Green Line is similar to the distance [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4082.3399999999997s)]
*  between Kibbutz Beiri and Gaza border. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4088.74s)]
*  I strongly support the two-state solution, and I even think that it will be a tragedy [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4092.66s)]
*  if from those events this process won't mature for some kind of agreement. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4097.7s)]
*  However, I'm thinking of my neighbors in my village, and I'm thinking of what telling [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4106.34s)]
*  in order to convince them that they could feel safe the day after this process will [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4114.0199999999995s)]
*  start. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4122.5s)]
*  Because Israelis remember Oslo. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4124.18s)]
*  What they remember from Oslo is Hamas bombing buses in Israel's streets. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4127.22s)]
*  So I'm curious what do you think I should tell them in order to convince them that this [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4135.0199999999995s)]
*  kind of process will make them feel safe? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4140.98s)]
*  Thank you, Mirav. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4148.0199999999995s)]
*  Mirav, thank you very much. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4149.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm very familiar with Kfosabafir, and I am married to a very nice guy from Kalkilia [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4150.5s)]
*  in the north, which borders Kfosabafir. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4156.0199999999995s)]
*  He used to eat his ice cream as he was a child in Kfosabafir. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4158.34s)]
*  But because of the upper side wall that was constructed between Kalkilia and Kfosabafir, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4161.62s)]
*  he cannot go anymore. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4165.78s)]
*  Listen, after October, it is very important for all of us who are keen to have a better [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4168.5s)]
*  future for us and our kids and our friends and to continue to reside there, is to stand [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4177.06s)]
*  for our responsible leadership and to say and act upon what we say, not only say things. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4186.26s)]
*  I had many Israeli friends in my life. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4193.700000000001s)]
*  Okay, unfortunately, I lost most of the moderates now, and I know that. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4196.18s)]
*  It's a sad reality. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4201.46s)]
*  It's a very sad reality. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4202.820000000001s)]
*  We lost the moderates on both sides because of the level of atrocities, because of the [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4204.740000000001s)]
*  levels of impunity, because I don't want to go into a blame game here, but I want to focus [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4210.5s)]
*  on our responsibility here in bringing things forward. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4217.14s)]
*  If we are passionate in bringing change to our societies, if we want to bring [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4221.700000000001s)]
*  a positive new future for Gaza to be the Saint-Hopé of the Middle East, why not? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4225.78s)]
*  For any humanity, I think for your friends and for my friends and for my family who is [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4234.82s)]
*  now in a tent in Rafah in Gaza, who cannot leave the border, the only thing that we need [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4239.78s)]
*  to agree that we need to provide is freedom, is security, is dignity, is human rights, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4246.9s)]
*  is education, is normality. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4257.299999999999s)]
*  I live in Palestine. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4260.5s)]
*  I used to live abroad. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4261.7s)]
*  When I came back to Palestine as a mother, the complexity of questions that I have to [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4263.299999999999s)]
*  answer with sanity to my kids is not imaginable. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4268.66s)]
*  We are being adapted to the abnormal. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4274.66s)]
*  So if we can urge, really, the leaders to sign a mega comprehensive peace deal that [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4278.5s)]
*  would grant the Israelis their security and peace, but at the same time, we should not [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4286.099999999999s)]
*  neglect the fact that the Palestinians' peace and security and human rights should be also [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4292.9s)]
*  treated in that deal on equal basis. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4297.86s)]
*  So if we grant the Palestinians, for example, their rights of mobility, of education, of [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4301.06s)]
*  investing in areas, see, in digging their water wells, which are prohibited by the Israelis, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4307.38s)]
*  why would the Palestinians, what would the Palestinians resist in that scenario? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4313.620000000001s)]
*  I think we need to think forward that for any humanity, everybody wants a decent life, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4318.820000000001s)]
*  a decent family, good job, parks around, good schooling system. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4324.42s)]
*  This is not the reality that we have been facing or living under the Israeli military [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4331.06s)]
*  occupation. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4336.26s)]
*  I assume you're Israeli. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4337.860000000001s)]
*  For the Palestinians and Israelis to see each other, the only encounter for any Palestinian [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4339.62s)]
*  with an Israeli is on the checkpoints. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4344.18s)]
*  So the only image of an Israeli in the Palestinian eye is the soldier who is carrying the gun and [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4346.58s)]
*  pointing it at my car or my kids or like threatening my human well-being. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4353.22s)]
*  So I think we need wisdom and I think we need responsible leadership, but we also need to [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4360.18s)]
*  avoid repetitive tactics and strategies that have been tried before. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4365.46s)]
*  So we should not be saying, yeah, let's go back to the negotiating table. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4370.18s)]
*  It doesn't take a genius. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4373.3s)]
*  Really, it doesn't take a genius. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4374.5s)]
*  If we all respect conflict resolution based on the two-state solution, let's do it tomorrow [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4375.9400000000005s)]
*  morning. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4381.860000000001s)]
*  Let's draw the border of the state of Israel. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4382.5s)]
*  Let's define that border. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4385.86s)]
*  Let's end the Israeli military occupation. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4388.18s)]
*  Let us recognize bluntly the Palestinian state. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4390.42s)]
*  I think that's how you make people feel safe. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4393.54s)]
*  Not by what you tell them, but what actions do they see being implemented on the grounds. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4396.58s)]
*  Thank you, Miral. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4403.38s)]
*  To an Israeli who says to you, because the hypothesis that you just offered was that if [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4404.02s)]
*  the Israelis start to allow Palestinians to have more mobility, if the Israelis provide [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4410.26s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4416.58s)]
*  No, not as in a favor. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4417.14s)]
*  As their human rights. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4419.62s)]
*  I think I'm quoting you. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4421.780000000001s)]
*  What is there for Palestinians to resist there? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4422.66s)]
*  An Israeli will come back to you and say, look, there are some Palestinians, maybe even [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4425.46s)]
*  most Palestinians who just object to our presence here. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4428.9800000000005s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4431.62s)]
*  And I reject this. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4432.900000000001s)]
*  This is again propaganda. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4435.06s)]
*  I mean, it's in the Hamas. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4436.5s)]
*  Bring this up. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4437.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4439.86s)]
*  How many of you are aware that Hamas actually amended their charter? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4441.46s)]
*  That Hamas actually accepted the two-state solution on the 67th borderline? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4446.26s)]
*  Please, guys, go read. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4452.34s)]
*  Please go read. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4454.18s)]
*  You could forgive an Israeli for thinking that that commitment is not very credible, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4455.14s)]
*  given what happened on October 7th. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4458.9s)]
*  But that's done. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4460.74s)]
*  That's a big achievement that we should not undermine. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4462.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4465.46s)]
*  That's why you're a human being at the end of the day. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4465.78s)]
*  Let me take more questions for you. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4468.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4470.26s)]
*  So I have just raise your hand really high. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4470.66s)]
*  So I'm going to try to get some diversity. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4473.78s)]
*  So I'll come to Maysoon and then Noam. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4475.62s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Dalal. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4481.78s)]
*  My question is on immediate next steps and peace talks. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4483.38s)]
*  As you know, in the news today, the Hamas delegation left Cairo [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4487.46s)]
*  claiming that Israel thwarted negotiations. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4492.18s)]
*  Israel said that there is no offering to return the hostages. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4494.34s)]
*  I heard moments earlier that the complete return of hostages [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4500.58s)]
*  for a complete ceasefire would be Hamas getting everything it wanted. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4503.860000000001s)]
*  Now, with this narrative, what I hear is shrinking civility of the Palestinian people, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4507.46s)]
*  stripping away their civility because of who represents them or who they support. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4512.740000000001s)]
*  And that's dangerous in international law. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4517.54s)]
*  Now, how can we move past that? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4519.3s)]
*  And what are immediate next steps so that we can come to a ceasefire? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4521.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4524.900000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4526.02s)]
*  Well, I can easily say ceasefire is common sense for anybody who believes in humanity nowadays. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4528.1s)]
*  Not because Ramadan is approaching, but because it should not be okay that for six months, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4534.42s)]
*  we have been witnesses to war crimes that are documented on every screen. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4541.14s)]
*  The targets are children and women, civilians, unarmed people. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4546.74s)]
*  While the Israeli military is using an AI-generated gospel machine [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4550.74s)]
*  that is very quantitative rather than qualitative under the pretext of targeting Hamas. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4555.139999999999s)]
*  Nobody can convince me rationally that Israel doesn't have the capacity [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4561.38s)]
*  to determine or locate where the Israeli, the Hamas bases are. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4567.139999999999s)]
*  They did assassinate just a couple of weeks ago the guy in Beirut in the middle of his office. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4571.7s)]
*  So to continue to kill and to destroy the human infrastructure in Gaza under the pretext of Hamas [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4577.94s)]
*  is something that needs our thinking, guys, all of our thinking. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4585.46s)]
*  Israel needs to stop and the impunity that it enjoys needs to stop. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4589.62s)]
*  You know, all the aid that Israel had been receiving from the US and the like-minded countries [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4594.179999999999s)]
*  under the name of the right to self-defense is basically a justification for the more killings [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4599.0599999999995s)]
*  and murders and deprivation of the Palestinian people. This should not be okay. But on Hamas, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4604.58s)]
*  I want to also clarify one thing. You might hear some Palestinians cheering Hamas. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4610.419999999999s)]
*  I want to tell you one thing. The people who might be, you know, or seem to be as if they are fans of [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4617.219999999999s)]
*  Hamas are not really fans of the ideology. There is a big difference of being a fan or an advocate [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4625.54s)]
*  of the Palestinian right to struggle under the Israeli military occupation, the Palestinian [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4634.98s)]
*  right to self-defense and to freedom, and in believing in a certain ideology. I just want you [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4640.1s)]
*  to draw a fine line when you think about the Palestinian people and themselves being fans of [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4644.82s)]
*  Hamas. What about fans of October 7th? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4650.419999999999s)]
*  If you if we're to poll Palestinians about it. October 7th for apparently many Westerns [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4654.74s)]
*  has started and ended on October 7th. For me, October 7th is ongoing until March 7th, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4662.82s)]
*  until tomorrow, as long as our people are dying. As I said, and I repeat, we need wisdom. We need [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4669.219999999999s)]
*  committed, responsible leaders who are ready to say yes to what came as reference to the peace [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4676.18s)]
*  process 30 years ago. We don't need to reinvent any wheels. Just whoever believes in the two-state [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4681.3s)]
*  solution need to come and draw the border of the state of Israel, need to end the Israeli military [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4688.26s)]
*  occupation, need to grant the Palestinians back their basic freedoms and rights in self-determination, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4693.54s)]
*  in statehood. But you're a scholar of politics. I mean, forget about the moral point. I mean, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4701.22s)]
*  just politically, how do you do that after October 7th? What guarantee, you know, to come to Mirav's [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4707.46s)]
*  question, what guarantee can you give the Israeli that, you know, there's not going to be any more [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4713.9400000000005s)]
*  October 7th? It seems like you're saying, look, October 7th happened because you're denying us [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4719.46s)]
*  our freedom. Give us our freedom. October 7th will happen anymore. You could forgive an Israeli [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4725.14s)]
*  for not being terribly convinced by that. It's really sad that we're only talking about the [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4729.94s)]
*  framework of October 7th while negating all the sufferings and the injustices and the cruelty and [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4735.54s)]
*  heinous act by the Israeli. I agree. But don't you blame Hamas for that? Don't you think, you know, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4741.78s)]
*  I'm here's another question. I hate to play the blame game. We're in a very bad situation and we [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4747.219999999999s)]
*  need to have an engaged in this difficult conversation for things to be taken forward, Tarek. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4751.62s)]
*  So for example, if you ask me, how do I see things going forward politically speaking? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4757.14s)]
*  I am inspired by the Northern Ireland case study. You know, the British, the UK and the US [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4762.660000000001s)]
*  recognized that the Good Friday Agreement could have never been reached without the inclusion of [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4771.62s)]
*  the IRA, which is the military wing of the Shen Fen at that time. It's not about, you know, exclusion [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4778.18s)]
*  that brings peace and deals. No, it's about including everybody. And I would tell you, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4785.46s)]
*  I mean, what does Hamas want? It's only a power struggle. It's a power sharing struggle. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4791.06s)]
*  They need to come at the table like we did with the IRA in Northern Ireland. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4798.74s)]
*  You know, it has been, it has been tried and it has been successful. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4805.78s)]
*  I mean, why don't we, why don't we go for it? No, who wants to kill you all? Who are you? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4809.139999999999s)]
*  So, so, so let's, can we please, can we just speaking on that? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4815.94s)]
*  We just please everybody, please help me because I've been trying to tell the world that we can [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4819.46s)]
*  have these conversations at Harvard like adults and we're going to do it. We're going to succeed. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4824.5s)]
*  So first of all, put up your hand and I will call on you. So, um, okay, I have a long list. Okay. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4830.179999999999s)]
*  I'm going to try to get through that, um, get through that list. I forgot your name. Andrew. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4836.9s)]
*  No, not Andrew. The one behind. I not sorry. Okay. Um, okay. So, so, you know, I was going to, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4841.78s)]
*  I was going to ask you a question, but I'm not, I'm going to hold my, so I have Noam. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4849.46s)]
*  Thank you for coming. You really touched my heart in many ways. I'm an Israeli. I'm a strong [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4854.98s)]
*  supporter of the Palestinian right for a state. I'm willing to pay high prices for this. I have [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4860.179999999999s)]
*  a lot of criticism to the Israeli government and to Israelis and still being, um, practical [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4864.42s)]
*  forward looking when you're talking about responsible leadership and wisdom, don't you [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4871.78s)]
*  think it will be better or an opportunity now for Palestinians leaders like yourself [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4877.14s)]
*  to actually not insist on, on the home, unlike looking at everyone as Palestinians and use this [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4884.1s)]
*  opportunity to say, we reject the approach of Hamas, at least Hamas, um, military arm, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4890.0199999999995s)]
*  and we want to offer another approach, more constructive approach and like use this [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4896.0199999999995s)]
*  opportunity to, to disconnect because you were insisting on, on, we are all Palestinians. We [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4900.339999999999s)]
*  shouldn't look only, um, on these separations. So I wonder if it might be better for the Palestinian [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4904.74s)]
*  cause for this to the chances of a two state solution. Thank you. Thank you. No, I did not [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4910.5s)]
*  advocate for the tools used by Hamas here, but the fact that Hamas, many, many Hamas members [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4916.26s)]
*  are Palestinians. This is a fact, you know, to accept the narration of Netanyahu that he [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4922.02s)]
*  will eradicate Hamas and that he will eliminate Hamas. This is irrational. This is irrational. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4927.860000000001s)]
*  This is ridiculous to, to believe he can, he can destroy some military bases. But as I said, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4933.46s)]
*  it's, it's sick. Yeah. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4940.0199999999995s)]
*  As Palestinians, we want peace. We want an imposed peace, not through negotiations. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4942.98s)]
*  International law is very clear. The terms for the two state solution are very clear. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4949.46s)]
*  Never going to happen. But it can happen with a mega deal with the Saudis coming on board. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4953.62s)]
*  Oh, good. Good luck. I want to be visionary. Yes. I want to be creative. I want to give Israel, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4958.5s)]
*  you know, whatever it's seeking in the Gulf world. But yet, listen, as long as the Palestinians are [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4964.179999999999s)]
*  not at the table, no security, no peace in the middle East will be granted as we wish. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4972.179999999999s)]
*  Why are you saying Hamas is the Palestinians? I didn't say that. I said many Hamas members are [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4978.099999999999s)]
*  at the end of the day, are Palestinians. But can I, can I, so, you know, the fact that he keeps [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4985.38s)]
*  going to Hamas is actually articulated in this military intelligence plan. This is their [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4989.38s)]
*  communication tactic to keep spinning everything around Hamas. Please read it. You'll find [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4994.42s)]
*  everything there. It's their communication strategy. Yeah. I was. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=4999.7s)]
*  We have been offering that approach for 30 years. I tell you, my own father, he left Earth [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5011.62s)]
*  without realizing his dreams, without delivering to me. I guess, you know, I guess, you know, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5018.9s)]
*  I'll just, I guess what she's trying to say is that just as political expedients, you know, for [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5024.259999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians who like yourself do represent a more liberal. Actually, you know, we just, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5030.259999999999s)]
*  we just announced in Palestine a new technocratic, you know, formation of a new [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5037.7s)]
*  technocratic government. This is a political step forward. So that's an effort. What did we feel [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5042.0199999999995s)]
*  on the Israeli side? No rejection of talking about the Cyprus city. But you know, I have a [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5047.78s)]
*  ton of Israelis. I have a ton of Israelis who will come to me and say, we hate Ben Gavir. We hate [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5051.62s)]
*  Smotrich. We condemn them, et cetera. And I have many Palestinian friends who are the most humane, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5056.58s)]
*  honorable people I have ever met. But if I ever say, I would never even ask them to say like, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5063.46s)]
*  Hey, can you condemn Hamas in the same way that these guys condemn Ben Gavir and Smotrich? Because [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5069.139999999999s)]
*  I know they won't do it. And I don't know why they won't do it. So we're not talking about you. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5073.62s)]
*  Just explain that to us. As a social science. Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Fair enough. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5079.14s)]
*  The next question I have is from Andrew. We'll take, we'll take three more questions. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5085.0599999999995s)]
*  So my question actually builds on this last discussion. You're from Ramallah. I actually [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5094.9s)]
*  was just hoping you could tell us a little bit about what's happening politically in the West [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5098.58s)]
*  Bank. What is the status of the legitimacy, the capacity of the Palestinian authority? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5103.46s)]
*  What are some of the political developments that are happening there that we might not be aware of [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5110.26s)]
*  since October 7, I think is the day. Great question. Lame joke, though. Okay. Yeah. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5116.74s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5123.06s)]
*  Well, the PNO doesn't enjoy authorities. It's called the Palestinian National Authority, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5127.54s)]
*  but without any authorities. You know, even if our president wants to leave from Ramallah to Jericho, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5131.38s)]
*  not to Amman per se, he needs a permission from the Israeli authorities. This is a fact that [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5137.14s)]
*  everybody should know and that we should not try to say. Every Palestinian lives under the Israeli [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5142.42s)]
*  military occupation. The Israelis decide on every detail of our lives, whatever comes in, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5148.9s)]
*  whatever comes out. We are living since October 7th in Ramallah. I was born in Jerusalem, by the way. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5154.0199999999995s)]
*  I did not mention that. So in my ID, it says born in Jerusalem. I usually obtain permits to go to [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5159.86s)]
*  Jerusalem, hold meetings, do some businesses. Since October 7th, I cannot enter Jerusalem. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5165.139999999999s)]
*  All our permits are canceled, permanently canceled, despite the security clearances that [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5170.66s)]
*  we used to have. So for example, if I have any medical emergency, nothing could get me to a good [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5177.62s)]
*  medical service beyond the border. Every morning, we see Israeli troops in Palestinian downtowns, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5184.5s)]
*  including Ramallah. Every now and then, our schools shut down and convert to online learning, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5192.82s)]
*  not because of a COVID, not because of a pandemic, but because the Israeli military troops decide to [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5200.0199999999995s)]
*  invade the city at a certain hour in the morning. Settler terrorism is a really [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5205.94s)]
*  threat to anybody who wants to work for peace in the future. Those are autumn settlers who have [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5213.7s)]
*  no principles. Excuse me. They don't see any humans when it comes to the Palestinians. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5219.46s)]
*  So the situation is really the Palestinians being very, very suffocated. We live in our own cities. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5225.62s)]
*  Even if I want to go and visit my mom, as I said, I would think twice before taking the decision, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5231.86s)]
*  because let alone the checkpoints and the deprivation and the dehumanization acts on [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5238.0199999999995s)]
*  the checkpoints, I would be scared from the settler terror who can attack me and my kids at [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5242.259999999999s)]
*  any moment, at any juncture. This is the reality that we are living. As I said, we're being adapted [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5249.78s)]
*  to the abnormal. We don't enjoy any equal human rights. Just in our small cities, my students [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5255.86s)]
*  cannot make it to the university because of the Israeli checkpoints and closures. That could happen [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5264.66s)]
*  randomly and in any place. Many universities have converted to online learning for the past semester, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5270.5s)]
*  all through the semester. The doctors, the nurses cannot commute between the city of residence and [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5277.46s)]
*  the city of service. The teachers, the patients, it's really catastrophic, the situation. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5284.02s)]
*  Yet the Israeli regime, this right-wing government, Smotrich Ben-Gfeer, are provoking more [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5293.22s)]
*  settler terrorism. And you have heard the pogroms that took place in Hohwara, in Sinjel, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5300.34s)]
*  in Ainsamia. You know the forest evictions orders that are taking place in Khan al-Ahmar, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5307.62s)]
*  in Ainsamia, in the Jordan Valley, even the growers and the farmers in Jericho, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5314.42s)]
*  all around the Jordan Valley, they face settler attacks on a daily basis. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5320.099999999999s)]
*  The trees are being uprooted. The people are being attacked. The situation is very catastrophic. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5327.38s)]
*  So if something explodes soon, please don't blame it on the Palestinian people. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5334.419999999999s)]
*  The level of dehumanization is really hard to explain. We need to take one more question. Eli. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5341.54s)]
*  Dr. Delal, thank you so much for coming. I think this is the third in the dialogues. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5356.099999999999s)]
*  And honestly, I think in some ways you had quite an easy job coming in. I think that almost everyone [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5360.9s)]
*  in this audience is really shocked and disgusted by what's happening to the people of Gaza, the [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5366.42s)]
*  overwhelming death, the horrors of the occupation. And I'm really grateful for you sharing some of [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5371.62s)]
*  your personal experience and your family in Racha. What's confusing to me though is that you came in, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5376.34s)]
*  I think, with an audience that was really willing to listen and hear why a ceasefire is needed now [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5382.74s)]
*  and generally agrees with you. But you started by talking about the importance of veritas truth [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5388.98s)]
*  and of the Socratic method. And then the first thing you said in response to Dr. Masoud's question [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5395.459999999999s)]
*  was a lie that's really, really easy to find out the answer to. So if you put back on the first [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5400.58s)]
*  tweet, which you said was at 6 a.m. before anyone knew, that's 6 a.m. American time. So it was two [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5406.5s)]
*  in the afternoon local time. And you know that because you tweeted it. And so the thing... [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5413.379999999999s)]
*  Go back to my tweet and listen, listen. Let me get to the question. So the question is, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5417.46s)]
*  and it's a variation on the theme of what else is out. Until the evening that day, by the way, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5422.02s)]
*  just to make things clear. The question that I'm asking and that a lot of other people asked as [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5425.86s)]
*  well is, what do you think is the most effective way to win over people? Because I think as far as [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5429.86s)]
*  I can tell from the reaction of many in the room, people have come in very sympathetic to your cause. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5434.34s)]
*  And while they might be sympathetic to your cause, have left not sympathetic to you. So I think how [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5438.82s)]
*  can we have a method that makes people understand what's going on in Gaza without [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5443.62s)]
*  making it combative? Thank you very much. Thank you for the question. May I rephrase the question [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5448.98s)]
*  just a little bit? Because first of all... Okay. Okay. Okay. It's interesting that you're speaking [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5453.62s)]
*  on behalf of the room. I didn't see them giving you that permission. It was 6 45 a.m. my time, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5458.0199999999995s)]
*  by the way. And nothing was reported on the casualties on the Israeli side until that evening. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5466.9s)]
*  Again, I express every empathy with every person, no matter who, no matter where that suffered and [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5472.02s)]
*  who is still suffering. Nothing can justify violence in my eyes. Okay. But I don't take [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5478.18s)]
*  things personal. So if you don't want to like me, it's up to you. The Palestinian cause is not the [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5486.42s)]
*  laal al-arikats cause. It's the Palestinian cause. And I told myself after this biased media campaign [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5491.620000000001s)]
*  that came after Tarek had announced my participation that this is not against me [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5498.34s)]
*  personally. This is against the truth. This is against anybody who dares to criticize the [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5503.7s)]
*  actions of the Israeli military occupation. And as I come here today from Palestine, I also promise [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5509.62s)]
*  myself to come with the intention of holding this difficult yet constructive conversation that we [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5516.18s)]
*  all need. We all need. I don't want to win any arguments today. Trust me. I really don't want to [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5522.34s)]
*  win any arguments. I'm not here to win arguments. I'm here to try to address your brains and to [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5527.94s)]
*  provoke the thinking of everyone to try to think more, learn more, be curious about learning. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5534.0199999999995s)]
*  Never take what I say and whoever comes and says for granted. That's why we're granted with brains. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5542.9s)]
*  So I don't take anything personal. And I hope to see you in future events and then maybe we [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5549.379999999999s)]
*  can do something together to help humanity in the region. So we're running out of time and I [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5554.34s)]
*  wanted to say just one thing also in response to Eli's question. So I don't know how time stamps on [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5561.3s)]
*  Twitter work, but one thing that one should be attentive to is just the different information [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5568.82s)]
*  environments that people live in. And particularly on that day and in the early hours of that day, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5574.18s)]
*  people lived in very different information environments. I remember telling some [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5581.62s)]
*  fellow Arabs that this was a horrific thing that was happening and they thinking that I was insane [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5588.66s)]
*  because they were seeing completely different media. They were seeing Hamas fighters penetrating [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5597.7s)]
*  military targets, whereas I was seeing the scene of Hamas fighters with the body of that [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5603.299999999999s)]
*  poor Israeli woman. So I do think people also lived in different media environments. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5608.18s)]
*  But you also have seen some videos where some Arabic voices were saying, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5613.620000000001s)]
*  no, no, no, this is military, this is civilian, stay away from them. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5617.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot to talk about there. But the bottom line point that I just want to make is, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5620.580000000001s)]
*  sometimes people should take yes for an answer. And the fact that you [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5629.540000000001s)]
*  reiterated that you would never consider the killing of innocent civilians, the rape of people [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5632.42s)]
*  as a normal struggle for freedom, I think is a very important and courageous thing for you to [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5640.42s)]
*  have said. And I'm grateful to you for doing that. I will say Dr. Delal, when I invited you [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5644.18s)]
*  back when we first met in March of 2023, I believed and I still believe that you have a very important [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5650.820000000001s)]
*  voice, that you are a very humane person. You're a Palestinian nationalist. You're not an Israeli [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5660.18s)]
*  nationalist. You're somebody who seeks your people's freedom, etc. And I hope, look, from this day until [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5666.74s)]
*  the day of judgment, Israelis and Palestinians are going to live together. They're the only two [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5678.34s)]
*  people whom God has decreed are going to live like this together. It's a Catholic marriage, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5682.66s)]
*  if I will. And for this Catholic marriage to work, it's going to require people of enormous [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5689.22s)]
*  empathy and goodwill and broad minds on both sides to forge these kinds of camps for peace. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5697.46s)]
*  You hosted me. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5704.9800000000005s)]
*  I believe and I still believe that you are one of those people on the Palestinian side. And I hope [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5706.66s)]
*  that we will have further opportunities to talk with you and argue with you. And I want to thank [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5713.7s)]
*  you again for coming here. I know that in the news stories surrounding your visit, could not have made [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5719.54s)]
*  this seem like it was going to be a hospitable place. So I'm very grateful to you for coming [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5727.139999999999s)]
*  and sharing your insights. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5731.38s)]
*  Thank you. And I want to end with two thoughts. How many of you have visited the Holocaust Museum [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5732.099999999999s)]
*  in Washington, D.C.? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5737.86s)]
*  Okay, I visited the Holocaust Museum at an early stage of my life because I wanted to learn. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5740.9s)]
*  I wanted to learn and I learned a lot. For those who did not go, once you go and visit, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5747.139999999999s)]
*  go to the second floor and look at the map that is held in the Holocaust Museum. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5752.9s)]
*  And you will see what we are trying to bring back to the world, Palestine as a state on the map. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5758.42s)]
*  Thank you very much for hosting me. However, I want to also end by saying [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5764.82s)]
*  and repeating our role as academics in bringing about a more informed discourse and to engage in [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5770.5s)]
*  those difficult conversations. As an academic, it was not okay for me to see Dean Douglas, for [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5777.54s)]
*  example, commenting to the American media outlets on my comments as being abhorrent. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5782.98s)]
*  One on one academia is investigation, is inquiry, you know, climbing up the ladder of inference. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5789.14s)]
*  And then you told them, had I seen the tweets, I wouldn't have invited her. We looked at my tweets. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5797.22s)]
*  We had a rigorous analysis without any intentions of judging somebody, but more of, you know, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5802.34s)]
*  being oriented and focused on really searching the truth and what could bring us together. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5808.900000000001s)]
*  I am a Palestinian woman, mother, professor who dares to teach conflict resolution [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5814.26s)]
*  in Palestine under the Israeli military occupation. I want to remind you that we all [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5821.3s)]
*  have a responsibility today towards the Middle East, towards the Palestinians, towards the [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5826.42s)]
*  Israelis, towards bringing peace. But we need to say the truth and we need to deal [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5830.58s)]
*  in the theory of conflict resolution with the root cause of what is causing all those [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5836.9s)]
*  atrocities. We all need to be saying there must be an end, an immediate end to the Israeli [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5842.34s)]
*  military occupation. We can have a two state solution once this military occupation ends. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5848.66s)]
*  And once the border of the state of Israel is defined, but to continue to tolerate civilized [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5853.7s)]
*  rhetoric without actions on the ground is something that those of us who are concerned and keen [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5860.34s)]
*  to bringing about a prosperous, positive future for our people, the Palestinians and the Israelis [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5866.42s)]
*  alike, we should ask for people to walk their talks. Thank you very much. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5871.14s)]
*  Okay, thank you, Dalal. We're going to have to end the floor. Thank you. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyI4qJ9IzA&t=5875.9400000000005s)]
