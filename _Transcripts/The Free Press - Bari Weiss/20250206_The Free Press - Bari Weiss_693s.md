Two weeks ago, America thought it was leading the AI race. Then, out of nowhere, a totally unknown Chinese start-up turned that assumption—and the American stock market—on its head.

DeepSeek, a Chinese company founded less than two years ago, released a free AI chatbot that rivals the most advanced available OpenAI products. And they did it despite America’s prohibition on shipping our state of the art microchips to China.

America was caught flat-footed, asking: How did this even happen? And could we actually lose this tech war?

Now, if your understanding of computers stops at the term hard drive, don’t worry. Bari has invited two incredible guests, experts on both AI and China, to break it all down for you. Tyler Cowen is an economics professor, an AI expert, and a must-read writer at his blog, Marginal Revolution. He is the author of over a dozen books, but frankly, we’ve lost count. He is joined today by Geoffrey Cain, an expert on China and the author of The Perfect Police State: An Undercover Odyssey Into China’s Terrifying Surveillance Dystopia of the Future.

Bari speaks to them about how this happened, and what it means. Is it a twenty-first-century Sputnik moment? And if so, is China now officially ahead of us in the AI race?

# Is China Winning the A.I. Cold War?
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow)
*  The major headline and the reason that this has caused such a stir was that, and this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=0.0s)]
*  was the surface headline, we'll get into whether or not it was true, it appeared as if a small [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=5.78s)]
*  Chinese startup surpassed what we believed until that moment was sort of the bleeding [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=10.3s)]
*  edge of this technology and that they did it for $6 million over the course of about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=15.26s)]
*  two months. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=20.46s)]
*  Now for comparison, OpenAI reportedly spent $100 million training its last model. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=21.46s)]
*  It has 20 times the number of employees. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=26.82s)]
*  The numbers that we're talking about here just were a fraction of what we consider to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=29.66s)]
*  be par for the course here in the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=34.4s)]
*  Now the question is whether or not that's actually true, whether or not they were actually [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=38.2s)]
*  able to do this on such a small budget and in a very short amount of time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=43.84s)]
*  So Tyler, what's the truth there? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=48.34s)]
*  Where did the headline get it wrong? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=50.54s)]
*  That's mostly not true. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=51.92s)]
*  So it may be the case that the final training cost was very, very low. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=53.24s)]
*  But you incur a lot of other costs in building the model. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=58.24s)]
*  For instance, the company had 150 people working full time trying to develop the model and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=60.84s)]
*  their salaries and all of the fixed costs of the enterprise are not included in that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=66.66s)]
*  sum. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=70.8s)]
*  Now it's still probably the case that their model is considerably cheaper and some of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=71.8s)]
*  that is that wages in China are lower, but they also had a number of innovations that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=76.2s)]
*  just enabled the model to be done for a lower cost. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=80.64s)]
*  So it is a breakthrough, but we will borrow from what they did just as they have been [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=84.6s)]
*  borrowing from what we've done. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=89.08s)]
*  And keep in mind the best products today are still the OpenAI products and Anthropics Claude [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=91.16s)]
*  and those probably have what you would call a clearer path to the basket of making yet [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=97.96s)]
*  further improvements. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=102.36s)]
*  So it has not surpassed us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=103.66s)]
*  No. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=105.16s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of theories floating around about how DeepSeek pulled this off. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=106.56s)]
*  The company claims that they did this without what until now we had all viewed as the sort [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=111.92s)]
*  of crucial component, which are these advanced chips. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=117.56s)]
*  Do you guys buy DeepSeek's claims here that they built this advanced AI without the chips [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=120.6s)]
*  or did they find a way around the export control that had been set up by the Biden White House? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Jeff, you want to take that one? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=131.0s)]
*  So there is evidence that they did get chips from Nvidia that may have been smuggled through [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=132.84s)]
*  Singapore. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=137.68s)]
*  This is according to one government report. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=138.68s)]
*  And then on top of that, there's also evidence that Surface that's been published in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=140.68s)]
*  Financial Times, which shows that they may have trained their chat bot, their gen AI [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  with chat GPT, with an OpenAI product. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, this would actually be against the license agreement of chat GPT. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=152.24s)]
*  So they would have been breaking the rules in that case. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=156.08s)]
*  But on top of that, the other problem here is that chat GPT and most American social [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  media and AI websites are not available in China. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=162.64s)]
*  They're banned essentially because of censorship concerns. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=165.4s)]
*  The Chinese government wants to be able to control what these AI can say about Tiananmen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  Square and the Uyghur genocide and so forth. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=173.32s)]
*  And so we now have a situation where China is making a breakthrough, but the US can't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  even compete with China on its own turf. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=180.28s)]
*  So that's the problem here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=182.6s)]
*  The borrowing of American ideas, of American technology, the imitation of it, but then [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=183.88s)]
*  also shutting out American companies from a vast consumer market that is China. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=188.96s)]
*  So you don't just to underline the point, you don't think there's any chance here that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=194.2s)]
*  they really truly innovated. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=198.24s)]
*  You're saying that it's all basically a sort of rehash or a steal of what we've already [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=201.2s)]
*  created. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=205.12s)]
*  I would say it's a breakthrough in the sense that they can do it cheaper. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=206.12s)]
*  They certainly need less computing power, as we call it in the field compute. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  But I wouldn't call it a major breakthrough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=212.32s)]
*  And as Tyler said, they haven't overtaken American technology. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=213.76s)]
*  They haven't leapt forward above open AI and what we're doing in America. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=217.28s)]
*  But they are catching up fast and they're finding ways to do it cheaper, faster, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=222.56s)]
*  in more imitative ways that could be very damaging one day to American industry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=227.48s)]
*  I think it's a bigger breakthrough than that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=232.64s)]
*  They had numerous algorithmic improvements. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=234.48s)]
*  I was texting with Neil Ferguson the day that this news came out, the historian and the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  free press columnist, and his basic take was a sentence, technological containment never [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=266.72s)]
*  works. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=272.56s)]
*  Tyler, do you agree with that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=273.56s)]
*  The word never makes me nervous, especially from a historian, but I mostly agree. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=275.12s)]
*  This technology is going to spread. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=281.24s)]
*  All the, oh, we need a six month pause to do this, do that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=283.36s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  I'm not opposed to the chip restrictions on China. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=287.88000000000005s)]
*  If I were President Biden, I would have done the same. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=291.36s)]
*  But I think we need to be realistic and understand they're only going to hold back China for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  a short period of time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=298.44s)]
*  And we need to be ready for the fact that they will likely be our peer in AI technology [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  and will move into a new world state where there's a kind of mutually assured destruction [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=305.56s)]
*  with these AIs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=310.12s)]
*  And that will be us and China. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=311.68s)]
*  And the key question is, what will the rest of the world use? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  I hope it's our products. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  Right now, DeepSeek is entirely accessible, totally free, open source. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=318.22s)]
*  How the company will manage to fund that is a huge question and we will see. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=322.6s)]
*  But I think it's important to say as we go to Africa three years from now, I would strongly [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=328.04s)]
*  prefer they're using American AI. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=332.72s)]
*  So one of the things that happened, I think the day or within a few days of DeepSeek sort [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  of sweeping the world, at least it felt like that the day that it came out, was that Nvidia [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  stock tanked by like 17%, indicating that the market certainly thought that they did [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=350.2s)]
*  this without the chips. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=355.68s)]
*  Is that how you guys understood that news? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=357.08s)]
*  Well, the way I understood that news was that people might have assumed that, yes, they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=359.2s)]
*  did it without the chips or they didn't need as much compute to create the AI. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=364.64s)]
*  But that didn't really come as a surprise to me because there are a number of hedge [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=369.3s)]
*  funds, a number of these Wall Street funds that have been looking at AI recently and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=373.06s)]
*  have been shorting some of these stocks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=377.52s)]
*  There are questions over, you know, does the earth even have enough natural resources and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=380.0s)]
*  energy and compute to allow the next generation models to even exist in the future? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, ten years down the line, are we going to run into the barrier, the barrier that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=390.24s)]
*  does not allow us to proceed further with this AI technology, which is so energy intensive? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  Personally, I think that we will find ways to make the computing needs less and less [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  over time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=405.74s)]
*  I think that this is going to be a problem in the end. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'm more of an advocate for staying ahead of the curve. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=409.5s)]
*  I do think that we need a lot more government investment in the chip sector. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=411.7s)]
*  We need a lot more drive in that area, the reshoring of American manufacturing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=415.82s)]
*  So this is the problem where we stand now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=420.94s)]
*  We're now in a situation where compute is going down, where these these chatbots are [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=422.94s)]
*  easier to make. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=427.52s)]
*  And as Tyler said, the tech will spread. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=428.52s)]
*  It's hard to contain. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=430.94s)]
*  It can't really be contained. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=431.94s)]
*  But we can do what we can to stay at the leading edge to ensure that the world hopefully [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=433.54s)]
*  one day is using American AI instead of Chinese AI. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  There's some chance this is all good news for America. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=440.26000000000005s)]
*  So if the game is simply who can throw up the most energy infrastructure as quickly [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=443.62s)]
*  as possible, I would predict we're likely to lose to China. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  And all this talk about big deals with UAE, with the Saudis, is an attempt to cope with [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=452.0s)]
*  the fact that we don't build energy supply quickly enough in our own country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  To the extent it's about algorithmic advances and you don't need as much brute force compute, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=462.14s)]
*  that at least possibly is a plus for the United States. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=467.64s)]
*  Well, one of the things, one of the assumptions that it seemed was shattered last week is [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=470.94s)]
*  this idea that largeness and scale meant being ahead, right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=477.82s)]
*  It seemed like the assumption or the consensus before this DeepSeq innovation was that the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=482.7s)]
*  large tech companies thought they were uniquely able to be ahead because of their size and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=488.04s)]
*  their power. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=493.0s)]
*  And then you have this little small player like DeepSeq sort of turn that on its head. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  And it reminded me a little bit of, you know, a comparison between, let's say, SpaceX and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=497.86s)]
*  NASA. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  For decades, we all thought only NASA could put a rocket into orbit. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  And then SpaceX, smaller, more agile, was able to do it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=507.3s)]
*  And now NASA seems more reliant on SpaceX. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=512.04s)]
*  So it makes sense for me, guys, of what this means in terms of the consensus about scale [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=515.16s)]
*  and whether or not that's actually the advantage. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=522.04s)]
*  Well, so we do live in an age of technological democratization. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=525.52s)]
*  We're seeing this with SpaceX. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=530.4s)]
*  SpaceX, by the way, still a very resource intensive company. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=531.88s)]
*  It's not as if their investments are small by any means. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  We're seeing it in AI. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=538.56s)]
*  We're seeing it in all kinds of technologies. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=539.56s)]
*  been massive advances, and especially in military technology, is drones. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=542.52s)]
*  We saw a lot of the first kind of cheap homemade drones coming out in Ukraine, some of them [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=546.92s)]
*  made in Turkey. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=552.24s)]
*  And, you know, these are drones that anybody can can snap a grenade on and you can, you [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=553.24s)]
*  know, fly it over a tank column and unleash weapon weaponry destroy tank column. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=557.12s)]
*  So what this means in the big picture is that the traditional forms of industrial organization [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=562.56s)]
*  of infrastructure, of warfare, military defense are potentially going to crumble in our age. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=568.36s)]
*  We're seeing a new age where, you know, anybody can get their hands on these technologies. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=574.72s)]
*  Anybody can innovate with them, find ways to make them cheaper and less intensive ways. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=579.12s)]
*  But then the question is, how do you respond to all that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=584.16s)]
*  And it might simply be that, you know, chips are getting smaller and smaller and smaller. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=587.16s)]
*  And what that means is that we're starting to hit some of the limits into what the you [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=592.48s)]
*  know what we can do in the physical realm with chips. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  But we still have to find ways to stay ahead of that curve because the way to respond to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=598.24s)]
*  these innovations to ensure that we're safe at home is to find ways to respond to these [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=602.12s)]
*  innovations. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=608.08s)]
*  So, you know, for example, if there are drones attacking tank columns, making tanks obsolete, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=609.08s)]
*  we need to find a way to respond to those drones. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's not necessarily going to be a cheaper way of doing things. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  We have to stay ahead of that curve. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=621.96s)]
*  Keep in mind scale may still win out in China. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=624.2800000000001s)]
*  So the major Chinese tech companies, say ByteDance, they all have their own AI models. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=626.96s)]
*  No one's talking about them because of the Matthew Effect. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  Explain what the Matthew Effect is, Tyler. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=634.52s)]
*  Well, once people start talking about something, everyone keeps on talking about it, right? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=636.08s)]
*  It's like the Barry Weiss Effect, we could call it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=640.52s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  So the other Chinese models could win out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind the deep-seek people, they're not in with the Chinese state. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  It seems the CCP was as surprised as anyone. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  They're not part of the crony capitalist machine. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=654.6s)]
*  Politically they could be the result of a clampdown. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=658.64s)]
*  So I wouldn't necessarily bet against the larger Chinese companies because the communist [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=661.64s)]
*  system is set up to favor insiders. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYSZWYF8Ow&t=665.96s)]
