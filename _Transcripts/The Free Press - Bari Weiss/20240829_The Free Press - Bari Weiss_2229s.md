John Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods Market, is one of the most consequential American entrepreneurs of our time.

Whole Foods began in 1980 as a small hippie health food store in Austin, Texas. Under Mackey’s leadership, it grew into the largest organic foods supermarket chain in the United States, selling to Amazon in 2017 for nearly $14 billion. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the company revolutionized the food industry, mainstreaming health-consciousness for a mass market. 

Despite the company’s crunchy progressive brand, Mackey is a staunch capitalist and a steadfast defender of free markets. He popularized the term “conscious capitalism,” which marries capitalism and social responsibility, emphasizing the role of businesses in creating a sustainable and ethical impact on society at large. 

Today, a conversation about what it takes to build a company like Whole Foods, what it is like to have enormous wealth, the role of unions in the American economy, and why he kicked his own father off the board of the company.

# Whole Foods Founder John Mackey on “F You” Money, Capitalism, and Happiness
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0)
*  Were there people in the sort of rise during the rise of Whole Foods that said, John, can [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=0.0s)]
*  you pull that back a little bit? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=5.48s)]
*  I mean, our clientele, they're hippie dippy progressives. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=7.32s)]
*  Sure, my PR team the whole way along. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=10.44s)]
*  If you would just be a progressive, you could be the toast of the media. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=14.6s)]
*  They love Whole Foods, but they don't like you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=18.84s)]
*  I'm not anti-union. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=21.04s)]
*  In a free society, unions have to be allowed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=22.04s)]
*  And so I always viewed the unions as competitors. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=25.8s)]
*  They were competing for the hearts and minds of our team members. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=28.24s)]
*  What is it like living with fuck you money? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  I'm Michael Moynihan, and this is Honestly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Today a conversation with one of the most successful and consequential American entrepreneurs [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=41.32s)]
*  of our time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=46.12s)]
*  John Mackey is the co-founder of Whole Foods Market and served as its CEO for 44 years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  He grew the brand from a little health food store in Austin to a company that sold for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=53.78s)]
*  $14 billion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=58.0s)]
*  And he's the author of the whole story, Adventures in Love, Life, and Capitalism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=59.0s)]
*  We discuss, among other things, how Whole Foods changed the way America eats, how having [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  enormous wealth has impacted his life, and what people get wrong about unions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=69.28s)]
*  John Mackey, welcome to Honestly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=79.68s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=81.16s)]
*  It's wonderful to be here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=82.16s)]
*  Now, the thing that I saw this morning, I was on the side of this morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=83.16s)]
*  Are people reviewing the book yet? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=88.16s)]
*  And I saw some article in Fortune magazine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=90.36s)]
*  Headline said, John Mackey, the man who changed the way Americans eat. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=94.2s)]
*  And I said, well, I never thought of it that way. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=99.52s)]
*  Do you see yourself that way as somebody who changed the way Americans eat, or was Whole [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=102.66s)]
*  Foods kind of following trends in America? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=106.68s)]
*  Obviously, the answer is both. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=108.68s)]
*  The metaphor I come up with, I think it's a pretty good one, is the surfer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  You have to catch the right wave if you're going to get a long ride. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  In a lot of businesses, there's no waves for them to surf, so they can't ride it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=120.76s)]
*  We did catch a wave, but we also really helped create that wave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=124.64s)]
*  I remember initially we were just kind of a hippie food store. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=128.32s)]
*  And then I always say Walmart actually had a huge impact. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=133.04s)]
*  When they went from just being a non-food store, and they started selling food, and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=137.36s)]
*  they created the super centers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=143.04s)]
*  That scared the conventional supermarkets tremendously with good reason. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=144.8s)]
*  So they all tried to shift to look, to spend less capital on their stores, to cut their [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=148.72s)]
*  labor back, to cut their service back, even cut the quality of their food back to get [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  less expensive so they can compete on price with Walmart. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=158.72s)]
*  And that really opened up something for Whole Foods just to have a nice store, a beautiful [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=162.52s)]
*  store where the food was fresh and beautiful and good service and a nice environment to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=166.36s)]
*  shop in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=173.36s)]
*  And we started noticing that we still had a lot of hippies in our stores, but we had [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=174.36s)]
*  long-haired hippies, but we began to get more conventional, we'll call them middle, upper [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=179.4s)]
*  middle class women shopping in our stores. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  And they didn't know what the products were per se. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=186.52s)]
*  They just knew that the produce was fresh and the meat tasted good. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  And the people, even though they had piercings and tattoos, they were really nice to them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=195.94000000000003s)]
*  And there was somebody they could ask questions to. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  So they became along. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=202.62s)]
*  And I think that... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=203.62s)]
*  So Walmart kind of made that possible indirectly by just scaring the supermarket so much that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=205.3s)]
*  they cut back on the quality of their stores and just to become price, price, price, price, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  price, enabling us to grow, grow, grow into a gap that was there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=216.86s)]
*  So a long way around your question is, I do think Whole Foods, not me personally, but [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=220.96s)]
*  I think Whole Foods Market did have an impact on the way people eat in America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=225.86s)]
*  Obviously, though, we, in some ways, our mission failed because America is fatter than we ever [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=230.42s)]
*  were. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  And junk food has hardly disappeared. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=236.33999999999997s)]
*  It's gotten bigger than when we got started. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  So is this a class divide thing? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  Because I mean, I had a comment the last place that I worked, everybody at lunchtime would [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  go to Sweet Green to get a salad. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=245.66s)]
*  And I once commented that if I went into the common eating area with a bag of McDonald's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  at lunchtime, it would be like carrying in a bag of pornography. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=254.54s)]
*  People would look at you and say, what on earth is he doing? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=258.1s)]
*  He's eating that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=260.86s)]
*  But we are getting fatter, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  So I mean, it seems like this sort of middle class, upper middle class is kind of cleaving [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=263.94s)]
*  off and becoming healthier. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  But that's not the case across the board. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=269.06s)]
*  Well, I don't like that the class as the, I think it's a consciousness thing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=271.14000000000004s)]
*  As you become more aware of what certain foods do to your body and your health and your longevity, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=276.86s)]
*  start to make different choices. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=282.98s)]
*  Does that overlap with class though, in some ways? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=283.98s)]
*  It may overlap with class, but it's driven by consciousness. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=285.7s)]
*  I mean, in education levels than it is class. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=289.02s)]
*  But I mean, sometimes class can correlate with that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  Is it causation or correlation? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=297.14s)]
*  We don't really know. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=299.52s)]
*  Maybe it's a little bit of both. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=300.52s)]
*  Because I remember the conversations that came out of nowhere about this issue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=301.52s)]
*  And I thought of you during this time, because I said, you know, if there's somebody who [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=306.62s)]
*  knows about this stuff, it'd be John Mackey. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  Was this the idea of the food desert? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=311.76s)]
*  There are places where people can't get good food when your stores are expanding. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=314.02s)]
*  You know, you've had how many more than in the past 10 years. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=319.02s)]
*  But do those exist? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  Food deserts? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  Is that a real thing? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=326.41999999999996s)]
*  Do food deserts exist? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=329.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=331.38s)]
*  Now, the question is, why do they exist? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=332.38s)]
*  And if you're anti-capitalist, if you're anti-markets, then you believe they exist because there's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=335.17999999999995s)]
*  a plot by the capitalists to keep food from poor people, lower education, lower income [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=341.26s)]
*  levels, and that they're victims of that, that there's just nobody that cares about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=347.42s)]
*  them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=353.18s)]
*  When of course, the answer is not, it's the opposite of that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=354.18s)]
*  Entrepreneurs would fill that need if that's what that market wanted. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=358.42s)]
*  But it largely isn't what that market wants. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=361.46s)]
*  I mean, somebody wants it, but not enough to make it a viable business. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=363.5s)]
*  That's the real challenge. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=367.98s)]
*  The market will provide what people want. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=370.38s)]
*  It's no different and it's particularly clear with food. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  If people want to eat vegan food, then vegan restaurants pop up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=377.7s)]
*  But if they don't want to eat it, then vegan restaurants die. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=383.46s)]
*  The market is responsive, and that includes in areas that are food deserts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=386.73999999999995s)]
*  Or as I like to say when people say, how come Whole Foods doesn't do more in that area? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  First I say, well, we did a lot of things in those areas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=395.34s)]
*  We opened several stores in what were called food deserts. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=398.02s)]
*  Some of them did well if they could draw from a wider area than that immediate area, and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=400.7s)]
*  others did not do so well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=405.74s)]
*  It was simply because the market really didn't want what we were selling. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=407.78s)]
*  You have to ... If people get mad about that, I would say, look, then why don't you be the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=414.02s)]
*  entrepreneur? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  If you feel like the market is missing an opportunity here, that you could sell healthy [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=420.29999999999995s)]
*  food in these so-called food deserts, do it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  Because think how much money you could make. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=428.42s)]

*  I just remembered actually that I wrote a story about this with the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=439.70000000000005s)]

*  We may have accelerated it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=464.41999999999996s)]

*  Real estate prices would go up, and people would want to move in close to the Whole Foods [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=471.5s)]
*  because it would solve their food issues, and neighborhoods would change and evolve. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=476.05999999999995s)]

*  End of the book, you say that capitalism is often described as rapacious and greedy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=498.29999999999995s)]
*  How do you define it if that's not the words that come to your mind when you hear the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=507.08s)]
*  word capitalism? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=511.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all, that economic system is held to unfair standards in my mind. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=512.48s)]
*  The first standards held up to is that any time business people are not acting altruistically, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  they're attacked and criticized as if every other part of society acts altruistically. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=524.36s)]
*  They're called greedy and rapacious because they need to make money in order to exist. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=529.36s)]
*  Because they are judged by the worst actors, there are greedy and selfish and rapacious [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=537.4s)]
*  business people. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=543.88s)]
*  Just like there are greedy, rapacious and selfish doctors and lawyers and government [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  officials because human nature is human nature. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=550.4s)]
*  It's not worse if you're in business and it's not better if you're in a nonprofit or if [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=553.16s)]
*  you're in the government. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=557.72s)]
*  Human nature is ubiquitous. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=558.84s)]
*  What did you learn about human nature from running this company for so long? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=561.12s)]
*  I learned that human beings are complex, that humans are both self-interested for themselves [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=564.76s)]
*  and their families and their immediate and their tribe or whatever they have, however [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  they define that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=575.6s)]
*  But they're also can be caring and they can be compassionate. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=577.08s)]
*  And so if you try to set up a company that you recognize those things, you don't ask [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=580.6s)]
*  everybody to make sacrifices all the time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=585.88s)]
*  You realize people are going to be driven by self-interest. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=588.16s)]
*  Set up your incentive systems correctly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=590.9s)]
*  But at the same time, when you create relationships between people that brings out the best in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=593.12s)]
*  human nature, it brings out the caring, it brings out the ability to be generous. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=598.32s)]
*  People almost always reduce human nature to these sort of cardboard characters. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=603.04s)]
*  You're either the money bags guy in Monopoly or you're a saint. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=608.0s)]
*  And humans are complex, we're both. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=613.0s)]
*  And we're different mixes of those things. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=615.28s)]
*  The thing people understand about business and capitalism is that it's going to give [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=618.4s)]
*  people what they want, not necessarily what they need or what's best for them, because [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=622.04s)]
*  people are making those choices themselves and they may make bad choices. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=627.44s)]
*  I mean, they'll make junk food, you know, I mean, because we evolved. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=631.36s)]
*  We evolved when calories were scarce. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=638.0s)]
*  For most of our tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of evolutionary history, we didn't [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=640.44s)]
*  get very many calories. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=645.84s)]
*  We were trying not to starve to death. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=646.84s)]
*  So now we can get them not just three times a day, we get it all day long. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=648.88s)]
*  And so we keep making bad choices, but we're kind of being driven by our biology. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=653.6s)]
*  It's not that business is evil. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=657.96s)]
*  They're just trying to give people what they're buying. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=660.26s)]
*  And what they want is calorie dense foods, even though they're not very good for us, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=662.88s)]
*  not now healthy for us. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=667.0s)]
*  I mean, there's so much. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=668.0s)]
*  I mean, I say this to my daughter the other day, trying to impart economic lessons on [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=669.0s)]
*  her when she said that a certain athlete was overpaid. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=674.48s)]
*  And I said, my dear, they never overpay somebody. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=678.4s)]
*  If they pay them as little as they can get away with, they're paying $330 million because [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=681.52s)]
*  LeBron James is selling jerseys in China. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=686.0s)]
*  And that's part of his value. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=689.28s)]
*  And she was like, oh, I guess that makes sense. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=690.28s)]
*  Well, sometimes they do overpay, but that's just a bad business. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=692.0s)]
*  It's a bad business. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't mean NBA is not going to do it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  They didn't do it deliberately. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=697.4399999999999s)]

*  Solidarity. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=876.24s)]
*  Unions have helped workers' rights to advance over the last 100 plus years. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=877.96s)]
*  Unions have been, rightly understood, they've been a very valuable thing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=887.92s)]
*  In a free society, unions have to be allowed. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=892.48s)]
*  Only in a non-free society would you not have unions. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=895.84s)]
*  I'm trying to say I'm not skeptical of unions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=900.4s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is that what most people don't understand about unions in the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=903.36s)]
*  United States is there's only one kind of union that's allowed in the United States. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=908.72s)]
*  It's legal. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  Those are adversarial unions. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  Company unions, like you have in Japan, are illegal. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=916.76s)]
*  The union movement, the labor movement, has made a competitor of theirs, which would be [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=920.76s)]
*  a company union, illegal to do. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=925.48s)]
*  So the structure in American unions is inherently adversarial. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=928.48s)]
*  At Whole Foods, we're trying to create this stakeholder, deeper partnership with our team [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=934.48s)]
*  members. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=939.08s)]
*  I always viewed the unions as competitors. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  They were competing for the hearts and minds of our team members. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=943.48s)]
*  If we didn't treat our people well, they'd have to pay union dues. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=946.6400000000001s)]
*  If they're fighting between management and labor, you're not going to have as good an [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=952.6s)]
*  organization. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=956.24s)]
*  You're not going to be as good a place to work. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=957.24s)]
*  And it's certainly in the marketplace because you don't have that cooperation between trust. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=958.96s)]
*  There's a capitalist function in there where the unions are competing with you and making [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=963.64s)]
*  you, in a way, pay your workers better. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=966.84s)]
*  They kept us honest. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=971.32s)]
*  They made us become better employers. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=972.44s)]
*  You can't take your workers for granted because they have an alternative in the marketplace. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=974.52s)]
*  Not only can they go work someplace else, they can decide to stay and organize. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=978.12s)]
*  And I respect that right. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=983.32s)]
*  I'm not skeptical about unions. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=985.24s)]
*  I'm not anti-union. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=987.32s)]
*  The unions are always calling me anti-union. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=988.32s)]
*  I'm not anti-union. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=990.76s)]
*  I'm simply recognized that I want Whole Foods to be such a great place to work that people [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=992.64s)]
*  won't choose to have a union. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=998.08s)]
*  They could. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=999.76s)]
*  We can't stop them. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1000.76s)]
*  But they chose not to, except in Madison. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1001.88s)]
*  Ultimately, then they changed their mind. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1004.96s)]
*  They decertified the union. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1006.92s)]
*  They decertified it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1007.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1008.92s)]
*  The union made all kinds of promises about what they were going to do. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1009.92s)]
*  If you elect us a union, we're going to change the dress code. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1014.12s)]
*  We're going to get you better health benefits. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1016.48s)]
*  We're going to get you better pay. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1018.28s)]
*  They can make any kind of promise they want. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1023.0s)]
*  Corporations, the companies, cannot make any promises when a unionization campaign is on. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1025.0s)]
*  We can now say, we're going to try to do better in the future. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1028.96s)]
*  But you can't make any specific promises. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1030.96s)]
*  So for one, the union was unable to deliver on their promises. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1033.64s)]
*  But more importantly, after that unionization thing, it was a wake-up call for me personally. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1036.96s)]
*  And I made this tour. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1041.56s)]
*  I went to every Whole Foods Market store in the company. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1042.6s)]
*  I met with probably just about every team member, every store. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1044.72s)]
*  I met with the leadership and the team members in the stores. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1048.28s)]
*  And I asked them the same question. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1051.36s)]
*  How can we make Whole Foods the best place to work for in America? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1052.76s)]
*  And we changed things at Whole Foods in every store in the company but one. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1055.36s)]
*  We couldn't change them in Madison. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  So we started making all these improvements. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1062.08s)]
*  We improved our health benefits. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1063.72s)]
*  We improved dress code. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1065.44s)]
*  We improved compensation. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1068.98s)]
*  But we had to negotiate with the union. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1071.96s)]
*  We offered it to Madison. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1074.0s)]
*  We'd like to do these things in this store too. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1075.0s)]
*  No, you have to negotiate with us. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  And so all the other stores are getting all these better benefits, better health care, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1079.2s)]
*  better compensation, except for this one store. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  And the team members at Madison saw that they weren't getting what the other Whole Foods [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1088.04s)]
*  Market stores were getting. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1092.56s)]
*  And the union wasn't delivering on its promises. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1093.76s)]
*  So I guess after a year, they decertified it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1096.52s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1099.44s)]
*  They immediately got pay increases and new benefits because they got what everybody else [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1101.24s)]
*  had. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1106.28s)]
*  The unions made Whole Foods a better company. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1107.28s)]
*  They taught us a valuable lesson. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1109.6s)]
*  And we just, you know, I never forgot it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1111.56s)]
*  After that, it was like, we're going to be the best place to work. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1114.16s)]
*  And we were. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1116.32s)]
*  We were voted one of the 100 best companies to work for for 20 consecutive years until [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1117.32s)]
*  up until the Amazon merger when we were really no longer eligible to do that because we're [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1121.1200000000001s)]
*  part of Amazon now. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1124.56s)]
*  So I'm pro-union and I see them as a competitor. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1126.48s)]
*  I see all my competitors as making Whole Foods better. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1131.24s)]
*  I'm not anti Trader Joe's. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1134.16s)]
*  Trader Joe's made Whole Foods a better company. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1136.48s)]
*  I'm not anti Walmart or Costco or anybody else. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1138.3600000000001s)]
*  Those are competitors. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1142.52s)]
*  Competitors are essential in capitalism. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  They innovate, they compete, and you have to up your game. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1145.96s)]
*  That's how you make progress in a free society. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  Is there something in the past 10 years that you thought was true 10 years ago that you [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1152.28s)]
*  no longer believe to be true? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1158.6s)]
*  What's happened in that period of time when you've seen everything evolve and you've [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1161.04s)]
*  seen the world change where you said, you know, I think I was wrong about that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1164.48s)]
*  I'll tell you the biggest thing. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1168.84s)]
*  You may have learned this a long time ago, but I only learned it in the last 10 years. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  Most people don't change their mind based on facts and evidence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1177.52s)]
*  I do most of the time, but I have found that arguments seldom convince people to change [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  what they believe. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1191.32s)]
*  And so it has saved me a lot of grief if I'd known that when I was younger because I consider [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1192.72s)]
*  myself a very good debater and I win a lot of arguments, but people don't change their [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1198.08s)]

*  You could argue about the economy, capitalism, diet, politics, religion. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1205.8400000000001s)]

*  I kind of think like a, I think dialectically, I think like a debater and I can get all my [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1215.16s)]

*  It's kind of a theme in the book because my father was that way and I learned to debate [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1222.44s)]
*  at the dinner table and it's a skill I have, but for most people they do not persuade. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1226.72s)]
*  I didn't realize how powerful it was in 10 years. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1235.44s)]
*  It's taken me about the last 10 years to realize I shouldn't argue with people because it doesn't [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1237.6799999999998s)]

*  If I present evidence and facts, will they change their mind or will they do what most [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1245.9199999999998s)]
*  people do, which is do a search on the internet and find whatever it is you can find on the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1250.0s)]

*  And I was like, you can find anything on the internet that confirms what you just said, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  but what you said was stupid and wrong. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1286.5600000000002s)]
*  You may not have a girlfriend. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1289.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm trying to learn from your book, John. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1291.6799999999998s)]
*  But people who buy this book, people buy this book are thinking, John Mackey started a little [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1293.48s)]
*  hippie grocery store in Austin, Texas, sold the thing for 14 billion dollars almost to [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1300.0s)]
*  Amazon. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1307.08s)]
*  I want to glean some lessons on how to be an effective CEO, manager, whatever. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1308.08s)]
*  Is that kind of argumentative streak? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1314.28s)]
*  Is that a good thing for being an effective leader and effective CEO? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1315.76s)]
*  What's good is being a good decision maker. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1320.4s)]
*  I mean, ultimately leaders are paid for making good decisions. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  All leaders make some bad decisions from time to time. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1329.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like playing in the major leagues. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1332.2s)]
*  You need to hit 300 if you're going to be a good major league baseball player. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1334.8400000000001s)]
*  Or if you're playing basketball, you need to be able to hit the three point shot with [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1339.4s)]
*  some degree of accuracy. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  Whatever your game is, you have to be good at it. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1344.0s)]
*  Well, leaders have to make a lot of decisions. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  Decisions about people. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1348.4s)]
*  Decisions about strategy. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1350.04s)]
*  Decisions about when something's not going to work and when to cut bait and Mitch made [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1351.96s)]
*  a mistake so you can turn around. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1355.04s)]
*  You have to be able to persuade people of things. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1356.76s)]
*  But if you're good at persuading people to do the wrong thing, then just having persuasive [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  abilities is far less important than being somebody who can make right good decisions [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1363.28s)]
*  that work. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1368.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a succession element in this book too. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1369.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a chapter but a coup against you. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1372.44s)]
*  There's a chapter and a coup but in fact, there were at least four or five coups that [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1376.68s)]
*  I point out. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1380.92s)]
*  This is like a Latin American country, not a grocery store. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1381.92s)]
*  I use the metaphor the Lord of the Rings which had a big influence on me when I was, I read [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1384.48s)]
*  it like five times when I got out of high school and I referred to it a few times in [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1388.16s)]
*  the book and there's the ring of power if you know the story. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  The ring of power is corrupting. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1394.16s)]
*  Most people cannot wear that ring of power. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1396.44s)]
*  Were you corrupted by it? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1398.52s)]
*  You'd have to ask other people. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1399.52s)]
*  Do you think you were corrupted by it? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1400.96s)]
*  No, I don't think I was. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1401.96s)]
*  I think other people were that wanted to wear the ring. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1403.24s)]
*  It's kind of hard not to be, right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1405.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1407.84s)]
*  If you're really mission driven and you're really committed to like I was, I really had [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  the higher sense of higher purpose, really cared about our stakeholders. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1416.28s)]
*  I tried to do the right thing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1419.8s)]
*  Did I always do the right thing? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1421.76s)]
*  No. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1422.92s)]
*  Did I have ego? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1423.92s)]
*  Well, I had ego sometimes. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1424.92s)]
*  So, I'm not a perfect human being. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1425.92s)]
*  So I mean, certainly if you brought all the critics in here, they would tell you how awful [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1427.88s)]
*  person I am. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1432.6000000000001s)]
*  What do the critics say? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  What's the one that resonates most with you or kind of rankles with you and say, that's [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1435.12s)]
*  not fair and I'm not that person at all? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1439.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, I poke fun at myself early on because one of my co-founders called me wacky Macky. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1442.7199999999998s)]
*  But I sort of, I take delight in it now because was I wacky? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1449.08s)]
*  Because so many things turned out really well. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1453.86s)]
*  All the predictions were kind of turned out wrong. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1456.8s)]
*  But what is really, a criticism that rankles is one that you, if you know it's not true, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1459.44s)]
*  it doesn't bother you. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  So it hurts when you realize that it is true, but you don't want to admit it's true. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if I'm willing, that whole book is about a lot of mistakes that I made. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1473.04s)]
*  So I make a lot of mistakes. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1479.0s)]
*  Changing your mind. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1480.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1481.24s)]
*  And I made mistakes. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1482.24s)]
*  I made bad business decisions. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1483.24s)]
*  I have a chapter called the $100 million mistake. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1484.24s)]
*  This is the internet stuff. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1486.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1487.92s)]
*  But also buying that mail order vitamin company was a huge mistake. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1489.68s)]
*  And I've made terrible mistakes about leaders and people and whatnot. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1493.72s)]
*  So I made a lot of mistakes. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1499.0600000000002s)]
*  Those criticisms don't rankle me because if you're defenseless, if you just go ahead and [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1501.0s)]
*  admit that you made the mistakes, then you don't have to defend anything any longer. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1505.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, I mean you talk about when you asked your dad to resign from the board, you said [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1508.48s)]
*  that the problem right now is I can't take somebody who's risk averse. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1514.28s)]
*  I need somebody who's a little more risk tolerant now. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1517.6s)]
*  I mean, that's the same thing when you're talking about your personal beliefs. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1520.56s)]
*  I mean, someone like you that's going to take risks in business is also going to take risks [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1523.32s)]
*  in telling people what they believe, right? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1527.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1529.6s)]
*  Probably so. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1530.6s)]
*  You know, my dad's case, that was different. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1531.6s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1534.32s)]
*  My father, he had Alzheimer's disease, but it didn't get diagnosed until about a year [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1536.56s)]
*  or so after he left the board. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1541.6399999999999s)]
*  But when you read about the early symptoms of Alzheimer's, it's his emotional outburst. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1543.48s)]
*  He was irrational. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1548.08s)]
*  My father had never been irrational. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1549.08s)]
*  He always, if you made a good argument, he changed his mind. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1550.68s)]
*  Here he was just blowing up all the time. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1553.84s)]
*  And that's one of the symptoms of the, when you get Alzheimer's, those are one of the [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1555.84s)]
*  first things that you begin to notice. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1559.72s)]
*  So I didn't get him off the board because we were arguing about, because we were arguing [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1562.3s)]
*  this because he was no longer rational. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  He was angry all the time for no good reason. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  And he couldn't even defend his point of view. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1572.04s)]
*  And I just, you know, it was just, we're a public company. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1574.04s)]
*  It was just, it was intolerable. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1576.96s)]
*  I like the bit where after he's diagnosed and you get in an argument with him and he [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1579.8s)]
*  says, well, you won, but I would have wiped the floor with you if I didn't have Alzheimer's. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1583.76s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1588.24s)]
*  I mean, my dad was such a good arguer, debater. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1589.24s)]
*  And so many times I felt like I had the facts and he was just so good at it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1591.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, a good, he was so good at, you know, making rhetorical points of view that he could [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1595.96s)]
*  twist things and he'd sometimes get the better of the argument. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1601.84s)]
*  Although I really felt like I had the facts. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  But at that stage, he no longer, he couldn't wipe the floor with me anymore. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1606.28s)]
*  Do you feel that a story like that, I mean, you tell that and it's, you know, in some [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1610.6s)]
*  ways it's like, that's a good refreshing bit of honesty here of what you're dealing with [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  in this situation and how difficult it was for you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1619.56s)]
*  I mean, your dad says something in response to you that is almost crushing to hear. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1621.36s)]
*  He's something to the effect of this is what I have left now and you're taking it away [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1625.76s)]
*  from me. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1628.98s)]
*  It almost takes the wind out of you when you're reading it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1629.98s)]
*  Do you worry that people think that he'd be cutthroat to do things like that? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1632.82s)]
*  There's a few moments in the book where the guy from Bread and Circuses who kind of betrays [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1636.38s)]
*  you in a way and you say, well, afterwards he got a divorce, his wife took half of it [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1641.46s)]
*  and he got taxed up the wazoo. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1646.74s)]
*  So sorry that you lost. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1648.7s)]
*  Is that the kind of business nature of you that people think contradicts with your kind [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1650.7s)]
*  of hippie-ish background? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1657.14s)]
*  As I stated previously, human beings are complex. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1659.96s)]
*  We are both self-interested and we're caring, loving beings. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  We're both. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1667.78s)]
*  And so I'm just honest about who I am. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1668.96s)]
*  I just show up, try to be an authentic person. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1671.96s)]
*  You know, in life, Michael, holding on to anger and judgments about people is really [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1674.44s)]
*  poisons your soul. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1683.88s)]
*  It's a very bad thing to do. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1684.88s)]
*  So I mean, the guy that did the coup, Chris Hitt, he and I are friends. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1686.74s)]
*  I mean, I put him in the Whole Foods Hall of Fame. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1690.5s)]
*  I once said if you hold... [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1692.86s)]
*  He really comes across as an asshole in that book, particularly in the coup when he comes [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1694.46s)]
*  up and says, it's your time, your time's going to go. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1698.74s)]
*  And he said, you don't have the votes? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1701.5s)]
*  He said, well, you know, too bad. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1702.5s)]
*  It's your time to go. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1703.72s)]
*  And he loses that battle. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1704.72s)]
*  You can be friends with him after that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1706.32s)]
*  Because Chris really did feel like he was, he really did believe that he was better. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1708.34s)]
*  All those guys that did the coup thought they should be running the company. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1713.62s)]
*  They just thought they were better than me. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1716.7399999999998s)]
*  None of those guys want to admit I was maybe a better leader than they were because they [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1718.6999999999998s)]
*  thought they were really good leaders. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1722.1s)]
*  It's the way the ego works. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1723.5s)]
*  It doesn't really want to admit those type of things. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1725.06s)]
*  Let me answer the boring, tedious, cliched question that I'm sure you get all the time. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1726.6599999999999s)]
*  But people are actually interested in this. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1731.06s)]
*  Probably why people will buy this book is, you know, being an entrepreneur, I don't think [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1732.6599999999999s)]
*  I have the kind of the architecture for it, the internal architecture. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1737.78s)]
*  I remember I once asked Christopher Hitchens why he wrote about novels all the time. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1742.54s)]
*  I said, you ever write a novel yourself? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1747.22s)]
*  He said, I just don't have one in me. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1749.5s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1751.94s)]
*  I looked and it's not there. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1752.94s)]
*  I don't think that I could do what you do. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1754.5s)]
*  And I don't know if I could learn it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1757.42s)]
*  You know, people go to business school, etc. and there's classes on entrepreneurship. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1759.54s)]
*  Well, I never did any of that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1762.42s)]
*  You never did any of that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1763.94s)]
*  I never went to journalism school, as you can tell right now. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1764.94s)]
*  Waste of money. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1769.26s)]
*  I mean, you didn't, you don't have a degree, right? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1770.26s)]
*  Right, no. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1772.26s)]
*  Peter Thiel and people in the libertarian universe, they don't go to college. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1774.26s)]
*  Go out and, you know, make your money and shoot your best shot and try to live your [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1778.3799999999999s)]
*  dream. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1783.26s)]
*  I mean, is that something you agree with? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1784.26s)]
*  By the way, Michael, has anybody ever told you look a little bit like Peter Thiel? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1785.26s)]
*  I wish I was a lot like Peter Thiel in some ways. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1788.6599999999999s)]
*  Because I am broke and he is not. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1793.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, can you teach this? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1794.8999999999999s)]
*  Is this something that is just who you are? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1796.32s)]
*  Or is this something that you learned along the way? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1799.1799999999998s)]
*  Can other people learn this? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1801.92s)]
*  It's both. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1803.08s)]
*  I mean, there is a set of skills you have to learn. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1804.08s)]
*  I wasn't, I had the entrepreneurial instincts when I was younger. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1806.6s)]
*  I just didn't have any skill. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1810.6s)]
*  I had to, I had to make a lot of mistakes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1812.04s)]
*  I had to learn. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1813.52s)]
*  People ask me, what's different with my new business than the first business? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1814.76s)]
*  Well, I'm older. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1818.12s)]
*  I have less energy. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1819.8s)]
*  That's the negative. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1820.8s)]
*  On the other hand, I've got, I've got this whole lifetime of lessons that I've learned [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1821.8s)]
*  about leadership, about how to create a company and build it and grow it and nurture it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1826.4s)]
*  So I'm bringing a lot more intellectual capital than I had. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1832.0800000000002s)]
*  I just have a lot less, you know, I don't have the passion of a 25-year-old. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1834.3200000000002s)]
*  Can I be very cynical and you won't get mad at me? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  Is it also, then excuse my language, I mean, it's also that you kind of have fuck you money [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1841.3200000000002s)]
*  now too, right? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1845.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, you can do things that are very- [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  I may not. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1848.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm pouring a lot of it in love life. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1849.3200000000002s)]
*  But yeah, you're putting a lot of money into this and you know, it's a little more comfortable [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1852.3200000000002s)]
*  to do that now. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1856.32s)]
*  I mean, when you're doing Whole Foods, your life was on the line in a lot of ways when [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1857.32s)]
*  you were doing that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1862.0s)]
*  When you're young, you have, if you fail, you have a lot, you have time to recover. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1863.0s)]
*  So if I was to go bankrupt at my age today, it'd be hard to recover that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1866.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1870.08s)]
*  So I'm not, so you're right with the fuck you money in the sense that I'm going to put [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1871.08s)]
*  a lot of money into love life, but I'm not going to risk everything. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1875.0s)]
*  I'm not going to risk my wife's, you know, old age and comfort. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1877.36s)]
*  What is it like living with fuck you money? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1881.08s)]
*  The real importance, the most valuable thing about- people misunderstand what wealth really [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1887.28s)]
*  is. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1893.2s)]
*  Because some people get addicted to money. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1894.2s)]
*  I've never felt addicted to money. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1895.96s)]
*  For me, money has always represented freedom, independence. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1897.72s)]
*  I can do whatever I want to do. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1902.12s)]
*  And that's why wealth, that's the value of wealth. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1904.76s)]
*  I can also be generous, and I am generous. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1908.08s)]
*  I can be generous for my friends. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1910.68s)]
*  I can be generous to people I don't know. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1912.08s)]
*  Everybody's a good virtue, and I can practice that abundantly and giving. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1914.2s)]
*  But mostly for me, it's been I am free, and I can do whatever I want to do. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1920.24s)]
*  That's a good feeling to have. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1926.92s)]
*  I don't think it was fuck you money because that's like, screw you. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1928.64s)]
*  That's not the way I think about it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1933.44s)]
*  I just feel like whatever I want to do, I can do. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1934.44s)]
*  There's not that many things I want to do, but if I want to do them, I can do them. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1937.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1940.2s)]
*  Fuck you money is probably the wrong phrase because someone who has fuck you money is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1941.2s)]
*  like somebody like Louis C.K. who is like, you can try to cancel me, but I can fill up [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1946.16s)]

*  Keep selling. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1963.56s)]
*  I asked that question because not everyone, and probably a very, very small percentage [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1964.56s)]
*  of people have thought about opening a grocery store or opening a store. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1969.8s)]
*  Every single person has thought what they would do if they had a limitless supply of [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1974.68s)]
*  money. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1979.72s)]

*  I know you from a universe in which you're very active and Cato Institute and things [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=1986.08s)]

*  You have Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2016.04s)]
*  Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22, and they're at this billionaires party. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2017.84s)]
*  Kurt Vonnegut goes up to Heller and he says, so this guy, he makes more money every day [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2025.84s)]
*  than you'll make for all the books you... [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2032.56s)]
*  Catch-22 and all the other books you've ever written and sold. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2035.24s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2037.8s)]
*  And he says, well, I've got one thing he'll never have. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2039.24s)]
*  He says, what's that? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2042.8799999999999s)]
*  He says, I have enough. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2044.84s)]
*  So money, power, fame, success, these are very addicting things. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2048.4s)]
*  Human beings are easily addicted to those things. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2056.36s)]
*  Unless you can master yourself and understand that those things will not satisfy your soul. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2059.08s)]
*  It buys independence. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2065.96s)]
*  It doesn't give you happiness. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2067.48s)]
*  It doesn't create real friends for you. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2069.48s)]
*  It doesn't give you... [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2072.1s)]
*  In fact, it creates a lot of fake friends, right? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2073.1s)]
*  It does. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2075.0s)]
*  It doesn't give you the things that are the most important things in life, which are love, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2076.08s)]
*  friendship, purpose. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2081.56s)]
*  And if you chase after money for its own sake, even if you get it, you're not going to find [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2084.36s)]
*  your soul is satisfied. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2089.44s)]
*  So people say, well, it's easy for him to say he's got enough money. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2091.36s)]
*  But the key word is I have enough. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2095.3s)]
*  I stopped taking compensation from Whole Foods back in 2006. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2097.52s)]
*  I gave all my stock options away. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2100.76s)]
*  I had enough. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2102.8s)]
*  I didn't need more. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2104.12s)]
*  I'm not doing my new business to get more money. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2105.36s)]
*  I'm doing it out of a sense of purpose and mission. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2108.0s)]
*  And because I'm an entrepreneur, it's going to be fun. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2111.0s)]
*  It is fun. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2112.8s)]
*  Creating something is fun. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2114.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think back to that other thing we're talking about, entrepreneurship. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2115.76s)]
*  You said you don't think you had that within you. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2118.52s)]
*  I don't think I have it in me, no. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2120.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, everyone has creativity within them. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2121.4s)]
*  So I don't know what your creative outlets are, but we are fundamentally, for human beings, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2124.88s)]
*  we have this creative part to our being. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2129.4s)]
*  Most people it gets damped down on because of school or whatever. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2132.32s)]
*  We get criticized a lot. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2136.7200000000003s)]
*  We become fearful to be creative. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2137.7200000000003s)]
*  But an entrepreneur is someone that has creativity in the form of creating businesses, enterprises. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  And as I try to capture in the book, because I think the entrepreneurs that have read my [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2148.1600000000003s)]
*  book really like it, because they feel like, that's me. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2152.04s)]
*  He's describing me. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2156.2000000000003s)]
*  For them, I always get asked questions about risk. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2160.32s)]
*  What do you think about this risk? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2163.32s)]
*  It's like, entrepreneurs don't think about risk. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2165.32s)]
*  They might think about whether this is a high percentage bet or not, but they're not actually [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2168.6000000000004s)]
*  kind of like weighing risk out so much. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2172.4s)]
*  As they're asking the question, for them it's more like play. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2175.44s)]
*  I think that's going to be fun. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2179.2000000000003s)]
*  I think we'll figure that out as we go along. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2180.84s)]
*  I never worry too much about failure. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2183.96s)]
*  I always had confidence in any situation we could figure it out. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2188.24s)]
*  We could find the solution. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2192.4399999999996s)]
*  And if we couldn't think of it, we could create it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2193.8799999999997s)]
*  There are always solutions to problems. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2196.04s)]
*  And sometimes you don't know the solution until you've dived in and then it comes to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2197.4799999999996s)]
*  you. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2202.7599999999998s)]
*  And so it's that playfulness, which is one of the key themes of the book, play, creativity, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  and love. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2209.2s)]
*  Those are the things that has made my life a rich, meaningful, good life. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2210.4799999999996s)]
*  Those things. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2216.08s)]
*  What a perfect way of ending it. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2217.92s)]
*  John Manke, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2219.92s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. I've enjoyed our conversation. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73c6tY7gXi0&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
