Read Louise Perry's piece in The Free Press: https://thefp.pub/4gT6c7o

Running The Free Press is Bari’s hobby, but her true passion is being a yenta. And one thing Bari has learned from talking to young singles is that there is a total breakdown of sexual relations these days between men and women.

Some blame social media, dating apps, or the alleged feminization of men. But Louise Perry blames the sexual revolution. In 2022, Louise wrote this for The Free Press: “The sexual revolution isn’t only a story of women freed from the burdens of chastity and motherhood. It’s a story about the triumph of the playboy.” This argument is the crux of her book, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, which has just been adapted for young adults—A New Guide to Sex in the 21st Century: The Young Adult Adaptation of ‘The Case Against the Sexual Revolution.’

Louise is here to explain how we went wrong as a society on dating, sex, porn, and marriage; how it is impacting women and men differently; how and if we can get back on track; how to date effectively in 2025; and how a revival of Christian sex ethics might be the answer.

# "1950s Sex Culture Got It Right" | Louise Perry
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA)
*  From the Free Press, this is honestly Happy Valentine's Day and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=0.0s)]
*  You guys don't know this about me, but one might say that running the Free Press is my [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=5.74s)]
*  hobby because my true passion is being a Yenta. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=9.56s)]
*  For my five non-Jewish listeners, that's Yiddish for I absolutely love to set people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=13.58s)]
*  up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=18.48s)]
*  Did I send a picture of my very attractive, very single producer to a stranger that I [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=19.48s)]
*  met in the elevator last week? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=24.14s)]
*  No comment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=26.18s)]
*  One thing I've learned from talking to young singles, and this office is full of them, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=27.54s)]
*  is that there is a total breakdown of sexual relations between men and women. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=31.36s)]
*  Some blame social media or the dating apps. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=36.62s)]
*  Others blame the alleged feminization of men. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=39.16s)]
*  But Louise Perry, my guest today, blames the sexual revolution itself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=42.18s)]
*  In 2022, she wrote for the Free Press, quote, the sexual revolution isn't only a story [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  of women freed from the burdens of chastity and motherhood. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=52.58s)]
*  It's a story about the triumph of the playboy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=56.66s)]
*  This is the crux of her book, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, which has just been [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=59.94s)]
*  adapted for young adults. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=64.86s)]
*  It's called A New Guide to Sex in the 21st Century. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  This Valentine's Day, I thought she would be perfect to come on to describe what went [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=69.66s)]
*  wrong about dating, sex, porn, and marriage, and about how this breakdown is impacting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  women and men differently. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=81.38s)]
*  We talk about how we can get back on track, how to date effectively in 2025, spoiler withholding [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=83.82s)]
*  as part of the advice, I'm sorry, and how a revival of what she calls as an atheist [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=90.52s)]
*  Christian sexual ethics might be the answer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  It is a provocative and fascinating conversation and perfect for this Valentine's Day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=99.33999999999999s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=105.38s)]
*  Louise Perry, welcome to Honestly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=112.18s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=114.5s)]
*  Okay, so it's Valentine's Day, the day that we celebrate romance and love. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  But a lot of young people in my country, and you're talking to me from England or country, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=121.06s)]
*  they are not having either of those things. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=126.98s)]
*  38% of Gen Z reports that they're not having sex, which is unbelievable. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=129.5s)]
*  73% report feeling alone sometimes or always. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=135.26000000000002s)]
*  I think the big headline is that we're living through a breakdown in romance and in sexual [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=140.7s)]
*  relations and maybe even in the ability to love that's happening. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=148.54s)]
*  And I'm going to just be pretty hetero in this conversation because most people are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=153.54s)]
*  between men and women. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=157.22s)]
*  Broadly speaking, diagnose the problem for us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=159.86s)]
*  Explain to us how that breakdown happened. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=163.46s)]
*  We have had a lot of societal change in a really short period of time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=166.46s)]
*  And some of that is ideological. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=171.34s)]
*  But most of it, and I'd say the ideology is also coming from this, is actually to do with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=173.46s)]
*  technological change. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=178.22s)]
*  I mean, the pill is basically like the big thing that I'm interested in in this book. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just the pill. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=184.9s)]
*  It's the internet. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  It's domestic and international migration, which is enabled by the aeroplane. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=187.66s)]
*  We've had this enormous technological change to the way that humans have lived forever [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=195.58s)]
*  that has occurred in the last, let's say, 200 years post-industrial revolution. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=200.9s)]
*  And that's really accelerated in the digital era. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=204.5s)]
*  And I think that what it's done is it's kind of shredded our social institutions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=207.22000000000003s)]
*  It's obviously brought a lot of comfort and affluence and convenience and all sorts of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=211.94000000000003s)]
*  things that I celebrate and everyone celebrates. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=218.3s)]
*  But it has also led to a lot of dislocation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=220.62s)]
*  And the example that I always think of when it comes to sexual relationships is, and this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=225.38000000000002s)]
*  really affects Gen Z. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=232.46s)]
*  It turns out that people left to their own devices, young people, actually find it really, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=233.62s)]
*  really hard to find life partners. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  It turns out that it's a really difficult coordination effort to meet the right person [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=241.86s)]
*  at the right moment, for them to be a suitable partner, for you to get hitched in the right [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=247.34s)]
*  way, start a family, all this stuff, this sequence of events that needs to happen at [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=252.22s)]
*  the right time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=256.14s)]
*  It's actually really hard. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=257.14s)]
*  I mean, I've been with my husband for over 10 years and we both look back and we're like, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=258.54s)]
*  how did we get so lucky? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=263.54s)]
*  We just basically bumped into each other and it kind of worked out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=265.7s)]
*  There isn't really a template now, not as such. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=268.22s)]
*  It's kind of an improvisation, I think. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=270.42s)]
*  Whereas in the past, and indeed in other cultures, my first degree was in anthropology. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=272.7s)]
*  So I always come at this with the mind of the anthropologist and thinking, what is it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=277.14s)]
*  about us that makes us different from other cultures? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=281.18s)]
*  Other cultures invariably have much more formal ways of doing things in terms of matchmaking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  young people and getting them married and getting them starting families. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=292.06s)]
*  We don't. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=295.3s)]
*  In some ways, that's good. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=296.94s)]
*  It does mean that the outlier people, the unusual people, can be experimental and can [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=298.7s)]
*  have more freedom and can have more options and that's really good for them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  But I think for most people, actually, it just produces a degree of passivity and almost [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=309.58s)]
*  flailing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=316.78s)]
*  I think that that's so much of what we see actually among young people now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=317.78s)]
*  There's a kind of profound uncertainty and we see that in the data. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, one of the things that's maybe a paradox is never before in human history has it seemed [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=329.14s)]
*  easier to meet people, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=335.22s)]
*  Like we don't rely on the village matchmaker. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=337.86s)]
*  We all have these little machines in our pockets that allow us to download hundreds of different [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=340.6s)]
*  dating and sex apps that presumably, at least on the surface, should make this whole mating [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=346.1s)]
*  and dating thing so much easier. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=351.9s)]
*  But the opposite seems to have happened. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=355.06s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=357.68s)]
*  Is it that there's simply too much choice? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=358.68s)]
*  And how do you think for young people, especially trying to navigate this, they should be relating [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=361.1s)]
*  to those apps? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  So I'm sure part of it is too much choice. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  It's like that thing where you log onto Netflix to watch something and you're just like, ah, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=368.74s)]
*  you end up scrolling forever. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  And then you're like, I'm just giving up. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  This is, you know, I'm sure there's a psychological process there, I think. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  I think it's also to do with some innate differences between men and women, which are quite hard [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=379.82000000000005s)]
*  to reconcile. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=387.06s)]
*  You know, there is an extent to which I don't want to overplay the battle of the sexes because [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=388.74s)]
*  actually men and women are completely capable and frequently I look in my own life and the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=395.06s)]
*  lives of others, you know, men and women can have the most beautiful, loving, lifelong [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=403.06s)]
*  relationships, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=406.98s)]
*  But there is also an extent to which male preferences and female preferences are a little [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=408.06s)]
*  bit at odds and come into tension in certain settings and not least in dating, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=412.06s)]
*  So the biological clock would be one example. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=417.82s)]
*  Women's fertility window is shorter than men's fertility window. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=421.74s)]
*  And ask any woman in her 30s who's trying to find a man. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=424.58s)]
*  That's a really difficult problem to solve because men feel as if they have all the time [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=427.94s)]
*  in the world and women really don't feel that way, right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=432.06s)]
*  And so there's a kind of, there's an inherent tension there where it's in the interests [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=434.98s)]
*  of a lot of men to play the field for as long as they can. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's not in the interest of a woman who's, say, in her early 30s, right, and starting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=443.74s)]
*  to get worried about her eggs. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=446.7s)]
*  When there are no established rules and not least, right, and I know that this is a controversial [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=448.42s)]
*  issue, when premarital sex is completely normalized, women's leverage is reduced. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=452.7s)]
*  Dramatically. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=459.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=460.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=461.98s)]
*  And it does become the case that if you're a high status man and you're attractive and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=462.98s)]
*  you do really well on the apps, which is true for a minority of men, you don't have to do [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=467.3s)]
*  anything that women ask of you, right, because there's like an endless supply of new women [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=473.66s)]
*  available and there is no stigma attached to leading them on, right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=479.74s)]
*  There's all of these interesting studies that show that there's a tiny percentage of men [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=483.58s)]
*  that basically get all of the women on the apps and then all of the rest of the men are [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=488.06s)]
*  sort of left with nobody. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=492.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=493.66s)]
*  And they're miserable about it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=494.66s)]
*  And look, the thing is, it is the case, I think, it is certainly the case that back [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=495.66s)]
*  in the day when you couldn't have premarital sex and when the expectation was that you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=500.3s)]
*  would get married and you would have children and it was rare to not do so, there were women [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=504.14s)]
*  who probably felt as if they'd kind of settled and felt like they were married to men who [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=508.7s)]
*  were dissatisfying in various ways. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=514.14s)]
*  I think that we have to face up to that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=516.86s)]
*  That clearly was the case. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=518.26s)]
*  Having said that, I do wonder if our very, very modern conception of what marriages ought [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=520.58s)]
*  to be like is, in a sense, unhealthy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=527.34s)]
*  There's this, Eli Finkel wrote this book called The All or Nothing Marriage. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=529.94s)]
*  Some years ago, it was a great book about the stages of marriage in terms of looking [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=534.82s)]
*  at American history specifically. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=539.46s)]
*  And he kind of modeled it on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=541.0600000000001s)]
*  So when you're living in a society which is very strained materially, say you're living [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=544.34s)]
*  on the frontier, right, in 19th century America, really your priority in a- [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=549.98s)]
*  Is living. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=554.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=555.2600000000001s)]
*  It's a partner who can chop wood for you, grow food for you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=556.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=560.38s)]
*  It's very much a union of survival and of course of reproduction and then allowing your [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=561.5s)]
*  children to survive as well. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=566.1s)]
*  But then as society becomes more comfortable, more affluent, people start to actually expect [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=568.02s)]
*  more from their marriages and they think, well, maybe I also want someone who's actually [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=573.26s)]
*  kind of fun to be around. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=577.06s)]
*  Maybe I want someone who I have a real romantic connection with. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=578.62s)]
*  When you get to the point now in 21st century America and other parts of the West where [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=581.82s)]
*  actually we expect so much from our marriages. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=586.86s)]
*  We don't just expect them to be economic and practical unions. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  We expect them to be sites of self-development and of authenticity, you know, all this stuff [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=593.58s)]
*  which frankly some marriages can meet that threshold but most can't. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=600.46s)]
*  I want to talk more about the state of marriage before we get there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=605.62s)]
*  The thing I hear constantly from young people that I work with who are still in the dating [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=609.14s)]
*  market is they'll match on an app, they'll match on Hinge and then after the second or [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=613.78s)]
*  the third date, everyone, especially the man, assumes that sex is on the table. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=618.58s)]
*  You have said, and you've gotten a lot of pushback for this, that you would tell your [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=624.06s)]
*  own children to wait until engagement because the risks of casual sex outweigh the benefits. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=627.58s)]
*  You spoke a little bit about that just earlier but can you put a little more meat on those [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=635.38s)]
*  bones and explain exactly what the risks are, especially to the woman but also to the man? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=639.38s)]
*  Particularly thinking about the woman's side here, sex induces, you can make sex inconsequential [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=648.5s)]
*  physically by using contraception with the provider that all contraception fails sometimes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=654.58s)]
*  But you know, there is now some super, super reliable contraception like the Marina coil [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=660.58s)]
*  and so on but you can reduce the physical consequences of sex through technology. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=664.98s)]
*  You can't reduce the psychological consequences of sex. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=670.1800000000001s)]
*  Those are baked in and they're particularly profound for women. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=673.38s)]
*  Women basically bond more with their partners from sex than men do on average. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=678.02s)]
*  It's not to say that men don't bond with their partners through sex but it takes longer. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=684.26s)]
*  Whereas women are more likely to bond straight away even if they're having casual sex, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=687.78s)]
*  It's very common therefore in these casual relationships to end up with a really, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=695.18s)]
*  really painful emotional asymmetry where basically the woman is more into the relationship than it [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=698.86s)]
*  is the man but doesn't want to say so and doesn't want to be needy and then you end up with these [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=703.74s)]
*  like really painful situations which make women in particular miserable. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=707.66s)]
*  That's one of the downsides. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=711.9s)]
*  I think the other downside is that attachment clouds your judgment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=713.1s)]
*  It just does and you might find yourself getting really committed to a guy who really actually [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=719.42s)]
*  isn't a good match for you, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=725.26s)]
*  And doesn't actually, if you were clear headed and you didn't have oxytocin running through your [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=727.58s)]
*  veins, you would realize actually wasn't a good match for you. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=731.74s)]
*  But having sex early on in the relationship makes it harder to spot red flags, makes it harder to be [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=735.26s)]
*  clear-eyed about the relationship. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=743.5s)]
*  I wish I could come up with a good alliteration for this but I always think that the period of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=746.38s)]
*  courtship should be strategic, brief and celibate. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=752.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=756.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=757.18s)]
*  Because actually I think this very modern concept which is a post-pill concept of spending [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=759.26s)]
*  a really long period of your young adult life kind of jumping in and out of relationships, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=764.22s)]
*  maybe living with people, this kind of purgatory almost that is now stretches and stretches is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=771.34s)]
*  really historically unusual. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=777.5s)]
*  It's much more common. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=779.98s)]
*  Obviously this is in societies where there's no contraception and so you can't have sex without [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=781.58s)]
*  it being risk in pregnancy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=785.9s)]
*  Like sex is super consequential. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  Where people will say, look, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to find a spouse and I'm going [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=790.22s)]
*  to be super strategic about it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go in really clear-eyed. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=796.86s)]
*  The family is involved. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=798.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't necessarily, I'm not saying formally arrange marriages but it's very common for [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=800.14s)]
*  families to at least have input, to have an opinion, to have veto power. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=805.9s)]
*  Whereas I think the way that we do it is very historically unusual and as we see from the data [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=810.9399999999999s)]
*  what ends up happening is a lot of people just never actually find a match. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=815.66s)]
*  They want to. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=820.54s)]
*  They're actually desperate sometimes to find a spouse and to start a family and so on. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=821.98s)]
*  And it kind of never happens to them because the coordination problem is too difficult [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=825.66s)]
*  and they don't really have any help. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=829.74s)]
*  There isn't like a support structure in place. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=831.34s)]
*  And I do think that the norm of having sex, as you say, on the third date or something [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=833.82s)]
*  really adds to that confusion. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=839.42s)]
*  And it also allows men in particular to kind of drag out the process because they don't [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=841.42s)]
*  really have an incentive to get married because they're having sex anyway. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=845.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=851.9s)]
*  I think it, I realize it's quite a, it sounds like almost foolishly old fashioned. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=853.1800000000001s)]
*  So my next question to you is going to be you're younger. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=861.1s)]
*  I'm 40. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=863.58s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=864.22s)]
*  33. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=865.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=865.82s)]
*  You're 33. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=866.3s)]
*  You sound like you're from another generation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=867.9s)]
*  So the obvious question is how did you come to these conclusions? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=870.54s)]
*  Because you and I, I imagine both grew up in a similar cultural environment because you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=874.78s)]
*  didn't grow up in a fundamentalist or super religious family, as far as I know. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=880.7s)]
*  You went to secular university. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=885.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, you're a woman. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=887.34s)]
*  If you don't identify as a feminist living out a kind of feminist life and that you have [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=889.26s)]
*  a career, you write books, you're really successful. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=893.5s)]
*  And that means that you, like me, grew up in a culture where we were told that casual [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=896.46s)]
*  sex with a man or anyone was liberating or if not liberating something we were certainly [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=901.58s)]
*  entitled to do, that the pill was a great thing that gave us power over our bodies, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=908.38s)]
*  which it certainly did. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=913.58s)]
*  Downsides weren't so much talked about. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=915.02s)]
*  The kinds of things you're saying, you know, are profoundly, I would say, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=917.1s)]
*  countercultural, at least in the mainstream. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=921.42s)]
*  So how did you come to, how did you come to this view? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=923.5s)]
*  Well, so I mentioned that my first degree was in anthropology and then I also did a [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=927.18s)]
*  degree in history and I focus particularly on women's social history. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=932.78s)]
*  So I always had an interest, I guess, in how other cultures manage these things. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=937.98s)]
*  And it introduced the idea to me that the status quo is not a given, that there are [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=942.62s)]
*  different ways of doing things. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=950.46s)]
*  There's this expression from Margaret Mead, the anthropologist, where she talked about [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=951.9s)]
*  the anthropologist's veto. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=956.38s)]
*  It's the idea that if the anthropologist can find any example in any culture of something [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  not being the case, right, that suggests that that isn't actually like a fundamental to [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=965.9s)]
*  the human experience. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=971.74s)]
*  And the thing is, you learn from anthropology actually is, in the anthropologist veto, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=973.34s)]
*  there are lots of cases of it, but actually there are a lot of human universals. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=976.94s)]
*  There have been various efforts to write down like human universals. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=980.22s)]
*  It's everything from religion or some sort of spirituality to warfare to, you know, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=985.82s)]
*  and marriage is one of those things, actually. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=992.22s)]
*  In some form, marriage is something that you see absolutely everywhere. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=994.4599999999999s)]
*  And yes, it can be polygamous, whatever. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=997.5s)]
*  There are all sorts of ways, things that can be different between cultures. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=999.5799999999999s)]
*  But actually, there are a lot of constants. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1001.9799999999999s)]
*  And the thing that I realized the more I read about this, the more I thought about this, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  is that we are odd. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  There are loads of ways in which we're odd. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1009.9799999999999s)]
*  And I thought, okay, why is it that we're odd? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1011.5s)]
*  And I ended up kind of cycling back and cycling back and thinking it's to do with technology, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1014.3s)]
*  it's to do with ideology. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1020.14s)]
*  But I kind of ended up almost, as you say, I came from a secular background. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1022.14s)]
*  I came from quite a left-wing background, particularly, you know, my early 20s, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1029.5s)]
*  when I first started thinking about this stuff, very much a feminist background. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1033.34s)]
*  This was not motivated reasoning, okay? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1037.5s)]
*  If anything, this was quite painful reasoning to actually almost reconstructed traditional [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1040.14s)]
*  Christian sexual ethics from the ground up, from looking at data, from looking at cross-cultural [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1046.6999999999998s)]
*  studies, from, yeah, thinking really deeply about some of these contemporary issues. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1054.86s)]
*  I kind of like painfully and reluctantly ended up reaching the conclusion that actually the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1060.2199999999998s)]
*  sexual culture of the 1950s was pretty good. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1066.4599999999998s)]
*  Like to the extent that you can solve like some profound and eternal human problems [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1069.58s)]
*  through social technologies, you can't always, everything has trade-offs, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1077.02s)]
*  that every culture has its flaws. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1080.46s)]
*  Like there isn't a utopia, there's never been one that isn't going to be one. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1082.22s)]
*  But in terms of like balancing these different challenges, actually, I think we did it pretty [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1085.18s)]
*  well right up until the sexual revolution when we threw it out the window. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1092.22s)]
*  Well, we threw it out the window, but there's, I think you would admit, because you're [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1096.78s)]
*  clear-eyed, that there's trade-offs to everything. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1100.46s)]
*  And the things we got, control over our bodies, so much more sexual freedom. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1102.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the 1950s frankly would have sucked for me. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1110.7s)]
*  There were a lot of things that we got. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1114.46s)]
*  So I guess, you know, it's impossible to say this, and maybe you don't even want to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1115.98s)]
*  participate in the thought exercise. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1119.5s)]
*  But if I put the question to you, like, if we could wind back the clock and undo the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1120.94s)]
*  pill, should we do it? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1125.26s)]
*  You know what I would do? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1127.34s)]
*  I've thought about this a lot. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1129.18s)]
*  I'm not that anti-pill. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1130.46s)]
*  People often kind of caricature me as being like, oh, she's that lady who hates the pill. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1131.74s)]
*  No, I have used a lot of hormonal, I'm using hormonal contraception right now. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1135.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1139.1s)]
*  I think that the pill is really useful, is really useful at the individual level. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1139.66s)]
*  It's only when it scales that it causes problems. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1145.98s)]
*  And I think that actually, if I was going to go back to any moment in time in terms [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1148.7s)]
*  of hormonal contraception, probably the best arrangement was actually a fairly brief [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1153.9s)]
*  period in the 1960s in America when it was available only to married women. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1159.42s)]
*  Because then it allows you to, I mean, the reason that I use the pill now is to space [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1165.9s)]
*  births, because it's really bad for your body to like have a baby every year. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1169.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1173.3400000000001s)]
*  So one of the really magical things about reliable contraception when it came on the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1174.22s)]
*  scene is it suddenly allowed women who were otherwise basically having their bodies [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1178.0600000000002s)]
*  wrecked by constant childbearing to space their births. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1182.62s)]
*  And I honestly think that's a miraculous thing. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1185.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1187.1799999999998s)]
*  But it's really when it's used as a means of preventing the consequences of [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1188.62s)]
*  premarital and extramarital sex, that's, I think, when you get the bad social consequences. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1198.06s)]
*  Do you think there are any positives to casual sex for women? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1202.86s)]
*  I think that some women genuinely really enjoy casual sex. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1207.7399999999998s)]
*  I think that one of the things that's kind of difficult, even for really smart people [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1212.3s)]
*  to wrap their heads around, is the idea of overlapping bell curves. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1217.5s)]
*  And the crucial personality trait that affects your enjoyment of casual sex is called [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1221.98s)]
*  sociosexuality. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1229.18s)]
*  Basically no one knows this term outside of the academy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1230.78s)]
*  But you can have restricted sociosexualities. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1233.26s)]
*  You're very monogamous and vanilla. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1238.7s)]
*  You can have unrestricted sociosexuality. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1239.98s)]
*  You're very adventurous and you like lots of variety. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1241.74s)]
*  And there are bell curves for men and women, and the male one you won't be surprised to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1244.3s)]
*  hear is higher towards the casual kinky end and the female curve is towards the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1250.06s)]
*  vanilla monogamous end. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1256.54s)]
*  But there's a lot of overlap. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1257.9s)]
*  And you do end up with some women who are very unrestricted in their sociosexuality [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1259.66s)]
*  and some men who aren't. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1263.9s)]
*  Like you really can't say that this is an absolute difference between the sexes. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1264.7s)]
*  It's a big difference. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1268.3s)]
*  But in the same way that men are taller than women on average, there are still tall women, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1269.58s)]
*  there are still short men. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1273.6599999999999s)]
*  It surprises me how difficult people often find to wrap their heads around this and to [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1277.74s)]
*  resist absolute generalizations. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1283.98s)]
*  That does mean that there are some women who genuinely get a thrill out of having a really [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1287.5s)]
*  high body count and being really sexually adventurous. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1293.02s)]
*  Those women do still face some pretty significant risks from casual sex, like pregnancy and [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1296.14s)]
*  violence, disease. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1301.9s)]
*  Women tend to be more vulnerable to getting STDs than men are, things like that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1304.14s)]
*  But there are some women for whom the enjoyment of casual sex is enough to balance that out. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1308.86s)]
*  The thing is, though, I think those women are pretty rare. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1316.3s)]
*  And I think that it's very easy for women who are living in a culture where casual sex is the norm [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1319.18s)]
*  to kind of kid themselves about their own level of sociosexuality because they want to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1327.42s)]
*  do what's normal. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1335.2600000000002s)]
*  I think this is particularly true for young people. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1336.0600000000002s)]
*  Young women in particular are super, super memetic. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1338.0600000000002s)]
*  They're very, very sensitive to what's cool, what's fashionable. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1340.94s)]
*  Being conformist is a very strong drive in particularly young women. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1344.78s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1349.02s)]
*  I think there's also an element of when you have had kind of unpleasant sexual encounters, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1350.06s)]
*  not rape, but like sex that you didn't actually really want, you didn't really enjoy, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1357.18s)]
*  it kind of left you feeling icky, whatever, it can be very attractive to have an ideology [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1361.34s)]
*  available to you which says that actually it was great. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1366.94s)]
*  There's nothing to worry about. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1371.1000000000001s)]
*  You're in control. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1372.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that sex post-feminism is actually most attractive to the women who've been burnt by our [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1374.22s)]
*  casual sex culture because it's kind of waiting there to scoop you up and actually [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1379.26s)]
*  reframe the narrative to make you the heroine of it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1384.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1386.54s)]
*  We've been talking a lot about women. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1386.78s)]
*  Let's shift and talk a little bit about the effect that this has had on men. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1388.78s)]
*  And I want to start with one thing that I've just anecdotally noticed and then there's been all these [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1392.7s)]
*  interesting studies that have proven it out, which is that high value men or high status men, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1397.18s)]
*  I hate using language like that, but I guess that's accurate, have sex with just tons of women [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1403.5800000000002s)]
*  and then the middle men or the lower status men don't at all. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1410.78s)]
*  And there's some people that are now taking up the argument, maybe conveniently so, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1413.98s)]
*  that this is evolutionarily normal. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1419.26s)]
*  Like it's normal and natural. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1421.9s)]
*  Essentially, like that polygamy is normal and natural. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1424.62s)]
*  Why fight it? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1427.6599999999999s)]
*  What do you say to those people and why do you think that that argument is having [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1428.62s)]
*  a resurgence right now? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1432.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1433.58s)]
*  So this comes down to a behavior that I think we do see cross-culturally, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1433.82s)]
*  which is called female hypergamy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1438.62s)]
*  So that's where women prefer to match with a man who is at their socioeconomic level or higher. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1440.46s)]
*  Women are reluctant to match with men who are lower than them in socioeconomic [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1449.5s)]
*  hierarchy. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1453.66s)]
*  And one of the reasons that this is causing more problems now than it has historically [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1454.86s)]
*  is because of what I didn't coin this term, but it's sometimes called tall girl syndrome. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1461.98s)]
*  So if you are a super successful woman and you have a good income and you've done really well [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1467.26s)]
*  professionally and academically and so on, and you want to match with a man who is doing better [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1473.74s)]
*  than you on all of those metrics, there just aren't very many of them. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1478.54s)]
*  So it's like a tall girl who wants to match with a man who's taller than her. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1482.14s)]
*  There aren't very many of them. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1486.5400000000002s)]
*  So you do end up with this issue specifically affecting women at the very top where they [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1487.74s)]
*  can't really find a match. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1492.6200000000001s)]
*  Whereas the men at the very top, as you say, they basically have their pick of the bunch [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1494.0600000000002s)]
*  because women are, there's a whole sway the women kind of, I know this is horrible, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1497.9s)]
*  like brutally economic language, but it does map out in the data. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1502.7800000000002s)]
*  And this is one of the things that dating apps has given us like loads and loads of data. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1505.42s)]
*  It's also just so clearly true for anyone that knows a very ambitious, very successful woman [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1508.3799999999999s)]
*  that's trying to date. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1514.78s)]
*  There just aren't enough of her matches out there. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1516.46s)]
*  There's a tendency, I think, for people who are familiar with this data to kind of exaggerate it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1519.5s)]
*  Donald Trump is an example of this, right? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1523.58s)]
*  Like a man who is very, very successful, not necessarily very good looking, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  but matches with Melania, like supermodel, but basically coming from a penniless background. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1531.34s)]
*  That happens. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1536.46s)]
*  So it's like a massive jump. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1537.1s)]
*  Melania has absolutely maxed out on her on her hypergamous instincts. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1538.9399999999998s)]
*  That is actually quite atypical though. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1543.1s)]
*  I mean, most couples you look at, they're actually not that vastly dissimilar [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1544.9399999999998s)]
*  in terms of their professions, in terms of their looks. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1549.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, like men tend to be a little bit less good looking than their wives. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1552.06s)]
*  But like, I think that there's a tendency to exaggerate this and suggest that everyone [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1556.4599999999998s)]
*  is doing this like crazy transactional kind of mating game. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1561.1s)]
*  But at scale, it is enough to cause some imbalances. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1568.78s)]
*  And what you particularly see is you see tall girl syndrome, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1573.98s)]
*  so really successful women who struggle to find someone. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1577.02s)]
*  And you also see men at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1579.4199999999998s)]
*  who also are struggling to find anyone. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think that that is a product of, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1586.62s)]
*  well, partly that's a product of the fact that we do sort of ends up with de facto polygamy [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1588.7s)]
*  as a consequence of not having a strict monogamous system, right? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1595.5s)]
*  Which is to say, if you're a high status man and you can attract loads of partners [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1599.58s)]
*  and you can have either kind of back to back girlfriends or you're dating women simultaneously [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1607.18s)]
*  simultaneously, or basically you're kind of almost living like informal polygamy. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1613.1s)]
*  Like you do, you kind of do have multiple wives. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1620.1399999999999s)]
*  No one calls it that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1622.7s)]
*  Well, they call it ethical non-monogamy or whatever, right? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1623.5s)]
*  If in a previous era, you had been forced as that man to settle down and marry just one lady, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1625.9s)]
*  you'd be removed from the dating pool basically. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1632.22s)]
*  Whereas now you can just continue kind of attracting all these women who are using [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1634.94s)]
*  hyper-cosmetic strategies. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1639.9s)]
*  So yeah, the reason that I think this is bad is that we have copious anthropological data [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1641.26s)]
*  showing that polygamous systems are bad for women and children. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1648.62s)]
*  You can see this even if you look at say African countries, which are side by side and which are [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1653.66s)]
*  otherwise similar, but which some have a permit polygamy either because they're Muslim or because [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1658.3s)]
*  of traditional African marriage patterns. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1663.26s)]
*  And then some are Christian and it's just on monogamy. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  Polygamous cultures do worse in quite a lot of ways. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1669.34s)]
*  Like monogamous cultures tend to be more economically successful, for instance. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1672.6999999999998s)]
*  One theory as to why that is, is because when successful men have excess resources in a [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1676.06s)]
*  monogamous system, they'll often use those excess resources to say invest in businesses [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1680.9399999999998s)]
*  or buy property or whatever. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1685.74s)]
*  Whereas in a polygamous system, they might use those excess resources to buy another wife. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1687.4199999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1692.3799999999999s)]
*  So it kind of encourages the sort of investment and economic activity that is good for growth. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1692.86s)]
*  There's that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1698.94s)]
*  I think the more profound argument against it actually is polygamous households are very [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1699.9s)]
*  conflict ridden. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1706.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1707.66s)]
*  There's conflict between co-wives. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1708.14s)]
*  There's conflict against stepchildren. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1710.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1713.8200000000002s)]
*  The Cinderella effect. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1714.0600000000002s)]
*  Stepparents are approximately a hundred times more likely to abuse children than our biological [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1715.98s)]
*  parents. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1720.6200000000001s)]
*  So like the more stepparents you have in the house, there's a reason the evil stepmother [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1721.3400000000001s)]
*  is a figure in fairy tales. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1725.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1726.7s)]
*  There are just all sorts of ways in which polygamy generates conflict and misery. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1727.5s)]
*  It also tends to generate an underclass of unmarried men. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1733.74s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1737.74s)]
*  Men who, if the top men are taking like loads of women's themselves, there aren't any [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1738.06s)]
*  left over. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1742.46s)]
*  And then so polygamous systems also tend to be higher in crime. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1742.94s)]
*  There are just loads of, again, this is like data driven. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1746.06s)]
*  I'm just looking at the research and I'm winding my way back towards like Christian [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1748.8600000000001s)]
*  conservatism against my wishes. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1753.1s)]
*  But like that's what it says. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1755.66s)]
*  But I think the assumption on the part of a lot of people who are watching this phenomenon [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1757.1s)]
*  play out, maybe not with the erudite language you use, but are looking at the phenomenon [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1761.82s)]
*  in real life, assume that eventually the highest status men will settle down. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1766.06s)]
*  They're not going to be playboys forever. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1771.66s)]
*  Not all of them can be Hugh Hefner. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1773.34s)]
*  But is that assumption wrong? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1774.94s)]
*  Are they actually settling down ultimately or no? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1777.5s)]
*  Do they just kind of go on doing playing the field indefinitely? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1780.38s)]
*  I'm not aware of any serious research. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1784.7s)]
*  I'd say anecdotally, you take a look at the personal life section of most Hollywood actors [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1787.2600000000002s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1792.38s)]
*  And I think it's quite rare to find a really high status man who marries his childhood [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1792.7800000000002s)]
*  sweetheart and stays with her forever. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1799.3400000000001s)]
*  They do exist. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1801.0200000000002s)]
*  They do exist. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1801.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, because it will depend on that individual man's level of social sexuality. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1802.3000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1806.14s)]
*  If he has a real craving for variety and is constantly kind of swapping in the latest [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1807.42s)]
*  girlfriend to feed that itch, there's nothing stopping him. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1812.14s)]
*  There's no stigma attached to it. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1816.46s)]
*  There's no legal restrictions. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1817.74s)]
*  He can just keep doing that and no one really minds. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1819.02s)]
*  One of the things that's happening right now is like in response to the phenomenon [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1821.26s)]
*  that we're all noticing, which is a winner take all and then a lot of other men left [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1825.42s)]
*  behind, there's a kind of whole cottage industry of male influencers, guru types that have [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1830.22s)]
*  sort of popped up to help men make themselves more attractive, more valuable in the mating [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1838.06s)]
*  market. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1843.18s)]
*  Some of it seems to me to be pretty healthy, you know, pick up the heaviest stone, make [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1844.14s)]
*  your bed, Jordan Peterson stuff. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1849.1000000000001s)]
*  And then some of it much more nefarious, things like Andrew Tate. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1851.02s)]
*  What do you think about this world? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1857.58s)]
*  How do you make sense of it? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1859.4199999999998s)]
*  Is it a natural reaction to the left behind men? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1862.62s)]
*  And how worried should we be about the rise of just out and out misogynists like Andrew [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1868.6999999999998s)]
*  Tate having such a profound influence on a lot of young men in our culture right now? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1875.98s)]
*  So you know, the really crucial difference between Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate, there [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1881.4199999999998s)]
*  are obviously lots of differences, but the one that I think is most salient to this issue [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1884.78s)]
*  is Jordan Peterson is basically preaching a Christian message and Andrew Tate is not. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1889.58s)]
*  The more I think about it, the more I think that actually that's really the key dividing [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1899.82s)]
*  line if you're thinking about American culture in particular. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1904.4599999999998s)]
*  And again, this is one of these, like I've argued myself into this position almost against [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1912.3s)]
*  my will, but actually I think there is- [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1915.8999999999999s)]
*  You're like, I am a Christian fundamentalist. I don't want to be, but I am. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1918.22s)]
*  The facts, Barry. Yeah. I think that we've already talked about the monogamy polygamy [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1922.8600000000001s)]
*  question, right? But there are other issues too. I mean, I'm absolutely fascinated by [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1929.5s)]
*  the very earliest centuries of Christianity and what has been called the first sexual revolution, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1938.3s)]
*  right? Kyle Harper, the historian, has written about this really beautifully. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1946.86s)]
*  So the first sexual revolution is basically the arrival of Christianity in the pagan Roman Empire. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1950.1399999999999s)]
*  And there are a lot of ways in which Christianity treated women much, much better than [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1956.9399999999998s)]
*  pagan Rome did. So the most famous example is the Christian objections to infanticide, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1966.62s)]
*  which was very widespread in Rome and particularly the infanticide of female infants. I mean, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1975.0200000000002s)]
*  it was so- the infanticide of female infants was so widespread that you ended up with, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1981.0200000000002s)]
*  in the later centuries of Rome, something like 130 men to 100 women. So really, really big imbalance. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1986.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And also women were basically held in very low regard. Women were completely incapable [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=1993.2600000000002s)]
*  of being in any kind of positions of authority within Roman culture. Men could basically have [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2004.86s)]
*  sexual access to any- if you were a sufficiently high status man, you could have sexual access to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2010.94s)]
*  anyone, particularly any slave. The idea of women having bodily or sexual autonomy was just [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2014.62s)]
*  confusing. It was just- I think that the expression Kyle Harper uses was the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2023.02s)]
*  beyond the range of vision for Roman thinkers. It just didn't occur to them, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2027.5s)]
*  And what Christianity did, which was very, very, very revolutionary, is it said, no, actually, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2034.06s)]
*  women are the spiritual equals of men. Women have the right to bodily and sexual autonomy, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2039.02s)]
*  just as men do. And that the Roman injunction on women to be chaste actually ought to be applied [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2044.3s)]
*  to men too. So the Romans held a sexual double standard so that basically women had to be chaste [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2051.66s)]
*  and wives had to be chaste, but men could do whatever they want. There was very, very widespread [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2058.46s)]
*  prostitution, particularly the prostitution of female slaves. Christianity objected to all of [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2062.94s)]
*  that, right? Objected to prostitution, objected to adultery, said that basically demanded that men [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2069.3399999999997s)]
*  behave more like women had been expected to behave, demanded chastity of men, which was [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2076.54s)]
*  so weird, incredibly- really quite an appalling idea for late Rome, right? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2081.9s)]
*  And actually, this is the argument that's made by Tom Holland in his book, Dominion. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2091.98s)]
*  In many ways, Me Too, despite Me Too being a secular movement, traces its origins back to that [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2095.58s)]
*  first sexual revolution, right? If Harvey Weinstein had been an ancient Roman patriarch, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2103.7400000000002s)]
*  no one would have cared about any of the stuff he got up to. He would have been a completely [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2110.62s)]
*  normal man just claiming sexual access to his social inferiors. No one would have cared. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2116.22s)]
*  The reason that we care, even now, even post-deChristianization, is because we've [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2120.7s)]
*  imbibed this idea that actually women have a right to sexual and bodily autonomy, right? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2128.14s)]
*  Which is why I think that deChristianization is a very risky thing for women, specifically, right? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2133.7400000000002s)]
*  Because the thing that Christianity says, which is very, very unusual- and by the way, it owes a lot [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2143.82s)]
*  to Judaism, right? Like, for instance, the injunction against infanticide is actually [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2148.7000000000003s)]
*  a Jewish injunction, right? Which then ended up as Christianity was a Jewish cult. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2152.7000000000003s)]
*  The idea that women and children and the poor and the disabled are not hateful by virtue of being [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2156.8599999999997s)]
*  weak, right? Women are physically weaker than men. That's just a fact, right? We can't get away from [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2165.2599999999998s)]
*  that. They're not hateful for being weaker. They actually ought to be protected and cherished by [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2169.3399999999997s)]
*  virtue of their weakness. That's a really, really weird thing, actually, to claim morally. Like, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2176.54s)]
*  to claim morally. Like, most cultures don't think that. That's quite a- that's a peculiar idea that [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2181.98s)]
*  Christians have come up with. And I really do think, like, I know that there are all sorts of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2188.38s)]
*  ways in which Christianity limits female sexual freedom. Abortion is a whole other issue. You know, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2192.38s)]
*  we don't have to talk about it today, but obviously that's really vexed. I get it. But also, I think [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2198.06s)]
*  that actually, Andrew Tate is a really good example of what happens when you just jettison that. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2202.54s)]
*  He doesn't think that weakness is virtuous. He doesn't think that women need to be cherished [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2208.38s)]
*  and protected. He just doesn't think any of these things in the way that John Peterson absolutely [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2215.02s)]
*  does. And I think that that's really- it's indicative of what happens if you repaganize, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2219.66s)]
*  right? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2229.1s)]
*  Nicole Soule-Pooja This is crazy. I can't even believe I don't know the answer to this. I assume [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2229.32s)]
*  the answer. Are you Christian? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2233.34s)]
*  Abbie [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2235.9s)]
*  Soule-Pooja Yeah, I guess so. Well, I keep going to church in the hope that I might suddenly believe [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2244.7s)]
*  and it hasn't really happened. I can make a very strong sociological defense of Christianity. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2248.62s)]
*  But that's not quite, you know, I'm told by Catholic friends that that's maybe very- [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2254.2999999999997s)]
*  Nicole Soule-Pooja You need to believe the Jesus part. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2258.86s)]
*  Abbie Soule-Pooja Yeah, I'm told by Catholic friends that that's [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2259.8199999999997s)]
*  me being very Protestant about it. It's me thinking like, I have to have like a super strong authentic [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2262.22s)]
*  inner belief in order to be a Christian and I can't find it. And I think, oh no, like something [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2266.22s)]
*  wrong with me. Apparently that's not necessary, they tell me. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2269.8199999999997s)]
*  We wouldn't call it this, but do you think we live in a pagan society? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2273.8999999999996s)]
*  I think increasingly, yeah. And I'd say that our increasing acceptance of assisted dying is a sign [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2277.8199999999997s)]
*  of that. I think that our increasingly casual attitude towards abortion is a sign of that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2284.9399999999996s)]
*  Again, there are situations in which I would want an abortion for myself and I would want it to be [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2290.62s)]
*  legal. And I would want an abortion for my daughter and I would want it to be legal. I'm not in any [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2296.54s)]
*  way like absolutist on abortion, but I do think that this, a casual attitude towards it, the idea [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2301.02s)]
*  that it's just like pulling a tooth, which you will hear from some activists, I think is expressive [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2309.66s)]
*  of that kind of repaganization. And actually I think that a big part of the reason why abortion [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2314.8599999999997s)]
*  is such a vexed political issue in America in particular and elsewhere is because it is [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2320.14s)]
*  precisely this, it's a battle about de-Christianization. Are we a Christian society or aren't we? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2325.9s)]
*  One of the things that, and I don't think that the Christian pagan dichotomy maps onto this, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2331.66s)]
*  but one thing I've been noticing, and I'm sure you have too, at least watching from far away, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2338.06s)]
*  is if we buy the Mark Zuckerberg argument that he made on Joe Rogan that has been floating around [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2344.46s)]
*  the center-right world for the past five years, maybe decade, that we've become a super feminized [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2352.46s)]
*  society and that the election of Trump, the rise of Elon Musk and the Musketeers, and etc., etc., [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2358.7000000000003s)]
*  means that that moment is over, that a sort of, like masculinity is roaring back from Washington [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2367.7400000000002s)]
*  and beyond. Do you buy that? Do you think if that is happening that it's a healthy correction? Like, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2378.5400000000004s)]
*  what do you make of this idea of a feminine society versus a masculine society? How do you make sense [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2384.86s)]
*  of it? Yeah, I think of it as the feminization of public life thesis. I think there is some, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2389.98s)]
*  definitely some truth to the feminization of public life thesis in the sense that there are, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2395.5s)]
*  again, it's overlapping bell curves. There are certain ways in which women, female personalities [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2401.02s)]
*  tend to be a bit different from male personalities. So women tend to be a bit more agreeable than men. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2407.58s)]
*  Women tend to be a bit more neurotic than men, which sounds really pejorative. It just means [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2413.34s)]
*  like women are more vulnerable to negative emotion basically than men are generally. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2418.62s)]
*  Um, women tend to be a bit more conscientious than men. Women have different styles of [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2422.3s)]
*  socializing slightly than men. So women are less overtly aggressive, for instance. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2430.46s)]
*  And you do see this playing out in workplaces. Like there's a move towards [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2436.2200000000003s)]
*  workplaces being more passive aggressive basically and featuring less direct conflict. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2442.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that does come down to a higher proportion of people in these spaces being [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2449.42s)]
*  female. And there ends up being a kind of, and I think by the way that it probably induces a lot of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2456.06s)]
*  mutual incomprehension where women don't understand the male way of doing things and men don't really [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2462.54s)]
*  understand the female way of doing things. So is it a good thing that things are becoming [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2468.06s)]
*  remasculinized? I'm butchering that, but you know what I mean. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2472.22s)]
*  I think it is a neutral thing. I think that it depends on this. I think it depends on the setting. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2476.94s)]
*  I think that there are some settings where the feminine way of, I'm going to say feminine, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2482.86s)]
*  just to accommodate the fact that this is overlapping bell curves and some women have [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2487.26s)]
*  super masculine personalities and vice versa. But I think that the more feminine way of doing things [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2491.1s)]
*  in some settings is very good. And then I think that the masculine way of doing things in other [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2496.54s)]
*  settings is preferable. A kind of classic example I think would be something like the military. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2502.3s)]
*  I think honestly, militaries ought to be overwhelmingly male and not just for physical [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2508.86s)]
*  reasons. There's also male forms of friendship are basically better suited to that kind of task [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2515.18s)]
*  where men are, for instance, more accepting of hierarchy than women are. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2525.82s)]
*  Women are quite much more egalitarian in our socializing with other women. And we have a bit [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2530.1400000000003s)]
*  of a tendency to do tall poppy syndrome, you know, where you like pull down the woman who's [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2535.58s)]
*  particularly successful or confident or whatever. We kind of impose egalitarianism on our social [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2540.6200000000003s)]
*  networks. Whereas men don't do that. Men are actually really happy to have like a big man [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2545.98s)]
*  who's the boss and everyone looks up to. I don't think that either is better or worse. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2552.14s)]
*  I really don't. I just think that they present their own problems [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2556.3s)]
*  and are better suited to some settings than to others. And I would say that I do think that one [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2562.7000000000003s)]
*  of the reasons why we have seen what you might call cancel culture, I always think that what [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2568.86s)]
*  cancel culture actually describes is people suffering social and professional ramifications [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2573.1s)]
*  for saying things that you could say openly up until really recently. And I think that the reason [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2577.34s)]
*  cancel culture emerged, particularly within the academy, does have a lot to do with feminization [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2583.34s)]
*  because women in general are much more present company excluded. But women in general are much [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2588.06s)]
*  more comfortable with censoring ideas which had seemed to be harmful, particularly harmful to [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2595.02s)]
*  vulnerable groups and basically care less about truth than they do about harm. And men feel the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2600.86s)]
*  opposite. I think that what we're seeing now with this rush under the Trump administration [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2607.9s)]
*  to tear down all of this kind of censorious woke stuff, I think that is definitely a return of [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2614.78s)]
*  masculinity to these spaces. And to some extent, I mean, I think we need a corrective, but I can [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2622.86s)]
*  see it over correcting and that might already be happening. One of the things that I think has been [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2629.42s)]
*  so detrimental over the past while is this idea of sort of tarring masculinity itself as being [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2634.38s)]
*  toxic or bad. And so now what we're faced with is like normal masculinity was sort of demonized. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2641.66s)]
*  That has led to the rise of talks, genuinely toxic figures like Andrew Tate. And I think men are left [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2648.54s)]
*  confused. So one thing I've been thinking a lot about is how do you bring back sort of a sense of [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2655.34s)]
*  admirable heroic masculinity, the kind of masculinity that leads people as they just did in LA to like [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2661.58s)]
*  run into huge enormous fires and save people's lives? How do we bring back that without bringing [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2667.82s)]
*  back like genuinely, I don't know how else to say it, toxic masculinity misogyny? I don't know. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2674.54s)]
*  I mean, it has to be, I guess. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2682.14s)]
*  Men, there's this idea in evolutionary biology of the male variability hypothesis. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2687.18s)]
*  It was kind of summed up, I guess, by Camille Paglia where she said, there's no female Jack [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2695.98s)]
*  the Ripper because there's no female Beethoven. I think Beethoven was her example of a composer, but [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2699.74s)]
*  men vary more than women do, right? In all sorts of ways, including physically, for some reason, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2705.3399999999997s)]
*  genetics kind of throws out more variation in the male than it does in the female. And that we see [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2710.3s)]
*  that with all sorts of things that there are more male geniuses and there are female geniuses. That [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2716.3s)]
*  isn't actually just to do with women being suppressed historically, although that is a factor. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2719.9s)]
*  It really is the case that you sometimes just get these wild cards, right, that are disproportionately [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2725.26s)]
*  likely to be male. So there are all sorts of features of men that are really admirable. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2731.1000000000004s)]
*  And men have disproportionately accounted for invention, for discovery, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2735.98s)]
*  they're more risk taking. We really do depend on men for an enormous amount of [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2744.38s)]
*  modernity, the things that make our lives affluent and comfortable. It's also true that men are more [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2750.14s)]
*  likely to be murderers and rapists and psychopaths and all the bad stuff, right? It's both. And I [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2756.54s)]
*  don't know if anyone has ever, I think this is an eternal human problem. What do you do about [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2763.9s)]
*  the good and the bad of the young energetic male? How do you successfully channel that energy [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2772.7000000000003s)]
*  in the right direction? I feel like in some ways that's the fundamental question [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2779.6600000000003s)]
*  that civilizations have to answer. I agree. Well, right now, a lot of that energy [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2783.1800000000003s)]
*  is being directed toward truly the most unproductive, is maybe a generous way to put it, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2787.74s)]
*  avenue, which is porn, right? And talk a little bit, you have very, very strong feelings [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2797.3399999999997s)]
*  about porn. I think it's safe to say. Given what you've said in the past hour, I don't think people [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2805.74s)]
*  would be surprised to hear that you are against it. But give us your wrap on porn and how you think [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2811.18s)]
*  young men and young women should be relating to it, if at all. I think there are a bunch of ways [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2818.06s)]
*  in which porn is bad. There's the kind of primary way that it's not a fair trade product. It's [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2822.7s)]
*  definitely produced with a great deal of human suffering. Just because a woman has consented [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2829.02s)]
*  to be in porn when it's filmed, it doesn't mean that she consents decades later for it still to [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2835.5s)]
*  be available and for her grandchildren to be able to see it and so on. So there's that kind of [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2841.58s)]
*  manufacturing objection. I think the social objection is, one, that it normalizes styles [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2845.02s)]
*  of sex, which tend to be very aggressive and degrading, particularly to women, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2858.38s)]
*  that I think, as you say, it can be really, really compulsive for men. One of the groups of people [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2865.42s)]
*  that I hear from a lot, readers, are men who are struggling with or have recovered from porn addiction. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2871.98s)]
*  Honestly, I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I think it's a really terrible [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2879.9s)]
*  affliction. I think that the porn industry is actually very well designed and I think quite [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2885.1s)]
*  deliberately designed to encourage that kind of compulsive behavior, particularly in male users, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2890.7s)]
*  some of whom are really, really vulnerable to it and will basically wreck their lives, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2897.02s)]
*  wreck their relationships, and end up, as you say, channeling so much of their energy, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2902.94s)]
*  their attention towards something that really only does them harm. I mean, it's obviously [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2911.5s)]
*  pleasurable in the moment, but long term, basically, only does them harm. I revisited recently [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2920.94s)]
*  for an essay the work of this Edwardian anthropologist, British anthropologist [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2928.14s)]
*  called J.D. Unwin. He wrote a book called Sex and Culture, which was published in the 1930s, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2933.1s)]
*  and he theorized—I don't know whether this is true. I'm just going to present it—he looked at [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2939.02s)]
*  86 different cultures on the anthropological record and he came up with—I'm fairly sure that J.D. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2944.2999999999997s)]
*  Unwin was autistic—he came up with a way of categorizing them based on their level of sexual [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2952.06s)]
*  permissiveness and a way of categorizing them based on their—he called it their expanse of [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2958.7s)]
*  social energy, but things like their increased wealth, territorial expansion, scientific [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2964.22s)]
*  discovery, basically all signs that a culture is really thriving. He concluded that sexually [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2969.58s)]
*  permissive cultures are not socially expansive cultures, which is to say that having a really [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2979.18s)]
*  sexually permissive culture tends to cause civilizational decline and the civilizations [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2986.06s)]
*  that are on the up tend to be sexually conservative, but there's a kind of cycle. He thinks that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2991.9s)]
*  that's part of what explains the civilizational cycles that we see across history. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=2997.1800000000003s)]
*  Nicole So does that mean we're a civilization in decline? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3001.1800000000003s)]
*  Anna He would definitely say so, yes, if he was still around. His theory was that this came down [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3003.6600000000003s)]
*  to the male energy and how you channel it. His theory is that if men have to make themselves [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3008.7000000000003s)]
*  marriageable in order to get sex, if they have to do whatever it is that a culture considers to be [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3018.94s)]
*  impressive, whether that be being a great warrior or making loads of money or whatever it is, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3025.34s)]
*  men have to do this stuff in order to get sex, they're going to do it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3029.42s)]
*  And if they don't, and if they can—even worse, he didn't know about internet porn, right? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3034.3s)]
*  If they can basically trick their monkey brains into thinking that they're getting sex [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3038.46s)]
*  by watching porn and masturbating all day, all of that energy is expended and all of that [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3043.98s)]
*  drive towards improving themselves is expended. To my knowledge, no one has ever repeated his [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3048.62s)]
*  study. I don't know whether his assessment of all of these different cultures was accurate, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3055.42s)]
*  but I think that that psychological explanation has legs. It does seem as if [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3059.42s)]
*  the male libido is a very powerful thing and controlling it and channeling it is one of the [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3067.18s)]
*  most important things that a society can do. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3075.66s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Has porn revealed innate desires that men have had for thousands of years? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3078.06s)]
*  Or has porn shaped and made more extreme their desires? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3083.74s)]
*  KATE BOWEN I think it's both. I think porn elaborates on these things. You might have the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3090.22s)]
*  seed of a particular desire, but then if you watch porn that features that desire again and [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3095.82s)]
*  again and again and you reward it through orgasm, you are basically training your brain in this [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3105.82s)]
*  dopamine feedback loop to like that thing. You double down on that thing. I think that that's [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3112.6200000000003s)]
*  what porn tends to do to people. So it's not inventing these desires. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3119.7400000000002s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So it's not as if men have always wanted to choke or pee on women, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3123.74s)]
*  but they've always wanted to dominate women. Seeing that act or acts play out in porn again [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3128.06s)]
*  and again and again normalizes sort of an inclination or a direction. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3135.82s)]
*  KATE BOWEN Yeah, that's my working theory. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3140.38s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK What is your advice to people listening about porn, especially young people? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3142.38s)]
*  Lots of people that I know are in relationships either where they sometimes watch porn to [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3149.1s)]
*  each other or maybe they know their husband or their boyfriend watches porn on his own and they [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3152.94s)]
*  kind of look the other way. Harmful, not harmful, be the authority here. What should people be doing? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3157.82s)]
*  KATE BOWEN I don't think there's a good reason to watch it, honestly. I think that including, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3165.42s)]
*  say, couples watching it together, I think that these images are really powerful and I think that [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3173.7400000000002s)]
*  once they get in your head. I think one of the things that porn does to be, I mean, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3178.38s)]
*  bearing in mind by the way that it's like a horrible industry, like let's just take that [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3183.6600000000003s)]
*  as red, right? It's like taking cocaine or something like that, right? Like there's so much [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3186.54s)]
*  sort of misery contained within this product. But leaving that aside for just a moment, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3189.7400000000002s)]
*  it's this doubling down thing that you describe. I think that porn [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3197.9s)]
*  shapes our sexuality in subtle and very insidious ways. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3202.14s)]
*  And I mean, just speaking to women who are younger than me, who are having [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3206.7s)]
*  relationships with younger men, they always say, you can really tell if a guy watches porn. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3216.7s)]
*  You can really tell. The way that he behaves in the bedroom is very clear that his tastes have [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3222.62s)]
*  been developed by porn and they don't consider that to be a compliment. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3227.82s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk just a little bit about marriage for a second. One thing that has transformed in [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3232.78s)]
*  the wake of the sexual revolution is not just our dating culture, but is marriage. In the US, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3238.38s)]
*  the average age of marriage is 30 for men and 28 for women. For comparison, between 1950 and 1970, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3243.6600000000003s)]
*  the median age for marriage in the US was around 21 years old for women and 23 for men. And the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3250.54s)]
*  national marriage rate here is nearing an all-time low. I assume that you think marriage is a good. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3256.06s)]
*  I would love for you to explain why and then talk about how we might change that around and [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3263.2599999999998s)]
*  bring marriage back. It's really the only solution we've ever come up with to deal with the problem [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3268.46s)]
*  of female vulnerability. And I know that will sound strange to people because people think [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3272.94s)]
*  domestic violence, yes. Although I would say statistically, actually, you're more likely to [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3277.74s)]
*  be a victim of violence from your boyfriend than you are from your husband. The idea that [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3281.42s)]
*  getting married is the thing that generates domestic violence is not true. But yes, I accept [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3286.06s)]
*  that. Again, it's going back to the trade-offs thing. Everything is trade-offs, okay. But [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3292.54s)]
*  there's this very specific problem that women face when it comes to childbearing, which is that when [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3297.18s)]
*  you are heavily pregnant and you have a young baby, you are really vulnerable and you can't [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3301.34s)]
*  participate in the labor market in the way that you normally would. You need at least one adult [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3307.9s)]
*  around to help you. Someone who ideally is really invested in their relationship with you, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3312.78s)]
*  is really invested in the child as well. And really, the very obvious person to do that [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3320.0600000000004s)]
*  is your husband, is the father of that child. And what marriage does is it formalizes that [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3325.5s)]
*  relationship and it says that, and sacralizes it as well normally, and says that the obligations, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3333.98s)]
*  just thinking of it from the woman's perspective, the obligations that this man has to you and has [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3341.9s)]
*  to your children are permanent and important and socially recognized. And the problem with not [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3345.98s)]
*  having that is that as we've seen post sexual revolution, it's really, really easy for men to [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3351.58s)]
*  basically up sticks and say, not my problem. This period of vulnerability for you, this helpless [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3356.38s)]
*  child that we brought into the world, not my problem, right. I think that actually, if you [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3362.46s)]
*  look at it from that perspective, marriage is really good for women, right. It's actually really [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3366.86s)]
*  protective of women. And yes, I know that there are of course, I do not think that women should [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3372.2200000000003s)]
*  have to stay married to abusive men. I think that divorce should be available in extremists. The [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3377.42s)]
*  problem is though, that we've kind of seen this cascade that as divorces become more normalized [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3382.7000000000003s)]
*  and become more normalized, we now see people actually ending marriages for really quite trivial [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3388.1400000000003s)]
*  reasons that aren't to do with abuse that actually, going back to what we were saying at the [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3392.06s)]
*  beginning, have more to do with not feeling fulfilled, not feeling like you can be the [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3396.7s)]
*  marriage is expressive of your authenticity or stuff, right. I'm exaggerating, but not by much. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3401.9s)]
*  Marriage solves a crucial problem that actually there isn't really, there's not a satisfying [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3409.34s)]
*  alternative solution. Why do people think they're the exception to it? Well, they don't. If you're [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3415.5s)]
*  trying to convince someone to get married and you say to them, this is the best solution we've [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3420.78s)]
*  ever come up with to the problem of female weakness and vulnerability, they're going to be like, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3425.6600000000003s)]
*  sorry, Louise, I'm not really sold by that. I know it doesn't sound very romantic and I realize [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3430.2200000000003s)]
*  it's Valentine's Day. Right. Is there a more romantic argument to be made? That lifelong love [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3435.6600000000003s)]
*  is real and that actually it is completely possible and beautiful and wonderful for [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3441.74s)]
*  for men and women to within a marriage to be the most important people to each other, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3452.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, right up until their dying day. Like that romantic ideal does exist. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3458.7s)]
*  People do attain that all the time. Completely ordinary people have relationships like that all [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3462.9399999999996s)]
*  the time. Everyone, you know, I don't want to say everyone could, almost everyone could have that, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3467.98s)]
*  right. In the right circumstances. And I don't think that we should think of it in transactional [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3473.34s)]
*  terms. I think we should think of it in mutual kind of complementarity terms. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3479.82s)]
*  Nicole Sade One of the things we were talking about earlier on in this conversation [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3486.46s)]
*  is that we've asked marriage to do too many things. We've asked the person to be our intellectual [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3490.14s)]
*  equal, our lover, our, you know, therapist. And I see this, you know, I feel this, at least many of [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3495.5s)]
*  us grew up with that kind of expectation. At least if you grew up in cultural menus like you and I [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3503.9s)]
*  have done, not one where matchmaking or arranged marriages or semi-arranged marriages is the norm. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3508.38s)]
*  What can we do to unburden the too heavy burden in my view that we've put on marriage? Is that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3513.82s)]
*  even possible to do as a culture? I think it's a problem that solves itself over time [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3519.66s)]
*  because I think that the people who are able to solve this problem, the people who are able to [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3524.7s)]
*  get married and to have children and to form functional communities and societies, are the [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3530.38s)]
*  people who inherit the earth, right. Like societies that can't, this is a book I'm thinking about [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3540.06s)]
*  writing at the moment. I'm kind of trying to wrap my head around this question, like [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3545.98s)]
*  one way or another, what can't go on won't go on. So if you have a really dysfunctional society [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3549.1000000000004s)]
*  where people are not having children, are not forming families, one way or another that has [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3556.78s)]
*  to end, right, either that society just goes extinct. I think that probably won't happen, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3562.2200000000003s)]
*  right. Or more likely the elements within the society that have found some kind of functionality [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3567.02s)]
*  gets selected for and flourish over time. And it might take some, it might take time and it [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3573.02s)]
*  might be quite a painful transition, but I think one way or another this writes itself, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3581.02s)]
*  something this fundamental has to write itself. How worried are you about the falling birthrate? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3587.9s)]
*  And how obligated should those of us who are married feel to have a lot of children? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3595.18s)]
*  I am worried about it. I don't catastrophize about it. I think that it is a, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3600.38s)]
*  I think it's a problem that as I say is going to fix itself one way or another. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3607.98s)]
*  I do think though that it poses some pretty serious challenges to the existing political order. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3613.02s)]
*  I don't think for instance that there is really any way that the welfare state can survive, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3619.82s)]
*  because the welfare state basically individualizes the burdens of having children and socializes the [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3623.9s)]
*  benefits of having children, which means that it disincentivizes people from having children. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3633.82s)]
*  And it also, as we're seeing in basically all Western societies and increasingly basically [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3639.82s)]
*  all societies except like a handful in sub-Saharan Africa have this really unbalanced demographic [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3646.54s)]
*  profile where there are so many elderly people and just not enough working-age people to support [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3652.7s)]
*  them. At the moment the way we're seeing that play out in politics is that the tax burden just [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3657.18s)]
*  gets heavier and heavier on working-age people and gradually the health care and welfare provision [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3662.54s)]
*  is kind of whittled away. Yeah, I mean one way or another that can't survive. And the thing is like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3671.98s)]
*  the welfare state is like a hundred years old in the great history of humanity. It's five seconds. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  It's so trivial. I think that that kind of political structure is imperiled by this problem. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3681.98s)]
*  I don't though think the humanity is imperiled by this problem. I think that some cultures might [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3687.9s)]
*  not be able to survive this. I think it's basically like a bottleneck that we're going through [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3692.86s)]
*  and it's really a bottleneck that's caused by the pill and other things too. Like there's so [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3697.66s)]
*  many different contributing factors. I could go on for hours about the factors contributing to low birth [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3702.38s)]
*  rates but I mean put really simply the societies that are shredding fertility most quickly are the [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3706.3s)]
*  societies that have embraced modernity most enthusiastically and that includes the pill. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3715.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think what we're going to see in the coming generations is basically [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3721.34s)]
*  the people who can withstand modernity and remain fertile are the people who are going to come out [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3726.3s)]
*  the other end. So humanity is not going to go extinct but humanity is going to change. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3730.78s)]
*  I think that's definitely the case. How's it going to change? It's probably going to become [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3736.7000000000003s)]
*  more religious. It's probably going to become more clannish. That sounds pejorative but people are [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3741.6600000000003s)]
*  going to become more committed to their extended families. Basically if you look at the groups that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3750.86s)]
*  are maintaining high birth rates even in the face of them plummeting everywhere else. So like the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3754.86s)]
*  really extreme examples would be like cultural orthodox Jews, the Amish, Mormons still have pretty [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3761.42s)]
*  high birth rates, not as high as they did but all of these groups what they have in common is that [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3767.1s)]
*  they actually tend to have quite traditional social structures. It's a combination of genetics and [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3771.6600000000003s)]
*  culture being transmitted down the generations that people who are most inclined towards those [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3776.54s)]
*  structures are the people who are going to survive the bottleneck. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3781.3399999999997s)]
*  SONIA DARA-MARIA only because you brought up Mormons. One question on that. A thing I've been [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3785.3399999999997s)]
*  really interested in is how maybe 20 years ago it felt like the high status thing was kid out of [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3788.62s)]
*  wedlock. You saw every celebrity in the world doing it. I don't need to name names. It was just [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3795.5s)]
*  everywhere. Now you look at the rise of Ballerina Farm, this online influencer and a lot of other [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3799.74s)]
*  frankly just like super sexy gorgeous Mormon tradwives as they are known. Do you think that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3807.5s)]
*  we're starting to see a change in what is considered sort of aspirational and high status in the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3813.9s)]
*  culture? When I wrote the original version of this book like four or five years ago, I hypothesized [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3821.58s)]
*  at the end of the concluding chapter that we might see a big swing back and that we might see a rise [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3829.26s)]
*  of tradwives. Thus it has come to pass. We do see that. I don't want to dunk on tradwives because [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3834.14s)]
*  I think that some elements of that trend are very cool and some of them are, you know, it's a mixed [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3842.3799999999997s)]
*  thing. I don't think it's surprising that we're seeing that swing back. If it means, for instance, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3849.66s)]
*  that there's more respect paid to mothers, I think that's one of the most [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3859.98s)]
*  shameful and disappointing elements of our culture actually post-Saxon revolution is actually how [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3870.86s)]
*  little respect is paid to mothers and how low status it is to be a mother. I think if we see [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3874.78s)]
*  any kind of cultural reaction against that, I think that's really good. One of the interesting [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3881.9s)]
*  things I think about say ballerina farms, this is Hannah Neelerman who's a Mormon. I think she's [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3887.26s)]
*  got eight children now. I don't know. She's a beauty queen. She's a ballerina and she's just, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3893.98s)]
*  she snaps back like two weeks after she has every baby. No wonder she inspires us. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3897.98s)]
*  It's beyond belief and I cannot look away. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3902.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. The thing I find really interesting about what she's doing is she's not, you know what she's [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3906.0600000000004s)]
*  imitating, you know what she's replicating is actually American frontier culture. The nuclear [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3912.3s)]
*  family out in the middle of nowhere, completely self-sufficient. That is obviously a historical [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3916.86s)]
*  trope, but it's actually not normal. It's not really traditional actually to have that degree [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3921.7400000000002s)]
*  of kind of isolation of the nuclear family and that much pressure placed just on the mother to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3926.2200000000003s)]
*  kind of do everything. I think that what's actually more typical across time and place is people [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3930.78s)]
*  living much more communal lives and living very close to extended kin networks and doing and [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3935.7400000000002s)]
*  sharing the load of domestic and other labor between members of the clan. This is why I say [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3941.82s)]
*  that I think clannishness is kind of being selected for at the moment because actually [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3950.86s)]
*  there are a lot of bad things about living in that kind of setup. It can be very stifling. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3955.1800000000003s)]
*  One's relatives can be very annoying, but actually, you know, there's a reason that humans [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3959.98s)]
*  have always banded together like this is because the stuff of life, including raising children, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3965.98s)]
*  is really difficult. And doing it together is kind of, it's like marriage, you know, it's like, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3970.14s)]
*  this is the social technology that we've come up with to solve this really difficult problem. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3976.54s)]
*  And we haven't really found good or sustainable alternatives. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3980.14s)]
*  SONIA DARA-MARGOLA-FERNANDEZ I guess the only thing to push back on with Hannah Needham is like [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3984.7s)]
*  ballerina farm. How much of it is an illusion, right? They look like they're living this like, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3987.66s)]
*  you know, frontier lifestyle. It's so beautiful. It's so romantic. You never see a nanny in the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3992.46s)]
*  shot, you know, but her father-in-law was the founder of JetBlue. And, you know, they have every [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=3998.3s)]
*  resource in the world, unlike the people that used to travel the country in covered wagons. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4003.7400000000002s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Yeah. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4007.82s)]
*  SONIA DARA-MARGOLA-FERNANDEZ So there is that. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4008.7000000000003s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK That's true. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4010.54s)]
*  SONIA DARA-MARGOLA-FERNANDEZ One or two more questions, and this has been amazing. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4011.42s)]
*  You know, I don't know how much you've been paying attention to the backlash that has arrived as Trump [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4016.6200000000003s)]
*  has taken office, but, you know, we're already at this stage, two and a half weeks into this [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4022.62s)]
*  administration, where people are openingly questioned whether or not women should be [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4029.2599999999998s)]
*  helicopter pilots. The pace of cultural backlash is moving so quickly that I feel like by next [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4032.8599999999997s)]
*  week, we could be at the point where people are talking about the foolishness of giving [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4039.3399999999997s)]
*  women the right to vote. And, you know, you and I have been sort of, I think, positioned [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4042.7799999999997s)]
*  fairly similarly in that we've been criticizing the excesses of, I would say, like left-wing [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4048.94s)]
*  illiberalism or woke culture, and maybe also some of the foolishness of a feminism that has denied [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4054.38s)]
*  biological reality and that has denied some of the things we've been talking about in this [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4061.66s)]
*  conversation about differences between men and women, among other things. But I'm watching [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4065.26s)]
*  as this backlash arrives, and I'm worried, and I'm wondering if you are too, and where you think [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4070.38s)]
*  this is going to end? And like how you, like if A, if you're watching it, B, if you're worried, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4078.86s)]
*  and if you had to predict where we might be in a year or two from now on some of these questions. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4085.1000000000004s)]
*  Of course I'm watching it. I mean, Britain is just an outpost of the American empire at this point. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4091.34s)]
*  Like this is extraordinarily important to all of us. Yeah, I share your concern. I guess what [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4095.5800000000004s)]
*  we're seeing is like 2020, but for the right, it's this incredible wave of institutional capture. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4101.58s)]
*  The right kind of flexing its policy muscles. The journey that I've kind of gone on across my life [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4109.18s)]
*  is from being a pretty standard progressive as a younger woman to now being, well, so I'm often [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4115.5s)]
*  earmarked as being conservative right-wing, whatever. But really I think that I'm a centrist, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4122.54s)]
*  actually. I mean, I tend to look like I'm right-wing from the left, but then I say, no, no, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4126.3s)]
*  you don't realize how far this stretches, right? You don't realize actually how right-wing you [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4131.74s)]
*  could go. I think I am actually a centrist if you look realistically across the political spectrum. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4137.02s)]
*  One of the things that I always try really, really hard to do is to be critical of some [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4144.860000000001s)]
*  aspects of feminism and some aspects of progressivism, but to always do so without hating women [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4149.9800000000005s)]
*  and without falling into the trap of demonizing women or being spiteful or belittling women. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4157.1s)]
*  The arguments that I've made in our conversation and through my work, I make them because I have [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4163.42s)]
*  women's interests at heart, men's interests too, but I think that women being the smaller, weaker, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4171.74s)]
*  more vulnerable sex need and the sex that also has been historically so often treated like [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4177.58s)]
*  property that one can abuse at will, particularly in non-Christian cultures as we've discussed. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4187.02s)]
*  Women need that advocacy and maybe this is easy for me to say from Britain. I think that the fear [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4191.660000000001s)]
*  about abortion rights is probably overhyped. I think that Donald Trump is actually, it shows [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4198.9400000000005s)]
*  an overall sign of wanting to say federally ban abortion. I think that focus is probably misguided, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4203.9800000000005s)]
*  but I think it is the case that certainly there are elements of the online right, which is now [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4212.9400000000005s)]
*  in the ascendant, which are genuinely misogynist, which genuinely feel [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4218.22s)]
*  dislike and spite towards women and those worry me, I think. Unfortunately, this is what happens [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4223.82s)]
*  when progressive overreach is so incredibly aggressive. I think this has always happened [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4230.38s)]
*  to some extent and this is exactly why people like you and me, Barry, were warning against [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4236.38s)]
*  progressive overreach because the backlash was going to come at some point and here it is. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4242.38s)]
*  SONIA DARA-MARGARET One thing I was thinking about coming into this conversation is Helen [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4245.58s)]
*  Gurley Brown, who famously wrote Sex and the Single Girl in 1962 and she was the long-time [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4249.9800000000005s)]
*  editor of Cosmopolitan and was arguably sort of like the first woman in our culture to say, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4255.58s)]
*  not only is it okay to have casual sex, but you'll like it. I wonder if you see yourself as a kind of [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4262.3s)]
*  anti-Helen Gurley Brown, kind of trying to pull back women to a, perhaps you would argue, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4268.7s)]
*  a more commonsensical place. Do you see yourself in some ways, because you've just rewritten [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4276.78s)]
*  your wonderful book, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, into a version that's accessible for [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4283.5s)]
*  teens and young adults and I can only see the motivation for doing that as being one of trying [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4288.94s)]
*  to reach a vulnerable and impressionable generation before perhaps they make the same mistakes. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4296.22s)]
*  HENRIETTA I was actually asked by a parent if I could write the young adult edition. I got an [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4304.46s)]
*  email from someone who said that he really wanted to give this to his daughter and he just felt like [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4308.14s)]
*  the original version was too explicit, too long, too difficult, too adult in every way. Could I [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4312.62s)]
*  write a version which was accessible? And I thought, great idea. So I took it to a publisher and they [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4318.62s)]
*  said yes, please. And one of the things I learned from doing the process of editing it, because we [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4322.06s)]
*  got young people to read it and to give their feedback, is quite how new these ideas are to, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4328.22s)]
*  particularly to teenagers who've been raised in the kind of progressive milieu that we've been [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4336.38s)]
*  talking about, where even something as basic as men are much stronger than women on average, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4342.06s)]
*  is really fresh to them and quite shocking to them. And it did make me realize anew [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4349.18s)]
*  how badly we've served them. Because if we can't even teach children stuff as basic as that, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4355.900000000001s)]
*  we're not setting them up to win. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4367.34s)]
*  SONIA DARA Let's end, because it's our Valentine's Day episode, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4368.62s)]
*  with a little piece of advice to women listening, especially women out there looking for love, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4371.9800000000005s)]
*  and men too. What would your one piece of advice be to each of them? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4379.1s)]
*  KAYLEE I'm different for men and women, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4382.46s)]
*  or the same piece of advice? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4383.9800000000005s)]
*  SONIA DARA I imagine it'd be different, given your worldview. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4385.02s)]
*  But maybe it's the same. Maybe it'll surprise me. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4389.58s)]
*  KAYLEE I think it is the same. I think there is a [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4391.58s)]
*  lot to be learned by trying to gain a deeper understanding of what the opposite sex is like, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4395.18s)]
*  but not in an antagonistic way. Not in a like, here are all the failings of men and women, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4399.5s)]
*  here's how they suck. There's plenty of that available, particularly on the internet. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4404.54s)]
*  One of the things that I've realized from being married for so long is we often don't really [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4410.3s)]
*  understand the opposite sex, not spontaneously. There's no reason why you would immediately [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4416.7s)]
*  understand how the opposite sex think about things without having to learn. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4421.58s)]
*  I think one of the nice things about marriage is that you do learn just through repeated and [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4425.9s)]
*  friendly exposure. You learn what the opposite sex is like. I really do think that one of the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4433.34s)]
*  reasons that the battle of the sexes is so toxic right now in online and in pop culture is because [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4437.18s)]
*  we're not forming these relationships and because we're not spending this friendly, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4445.74s)]
*  intimate time around the opposite sex. I don't mean sexual, I just mean living with each other, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4451.26s)]
*  getting to know each other, understanding how men and women view things. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4456.62s)]
*  I think it's a loss because actually, one way or another, men and women have to learn to get along. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4460.22s)]
*  I think if we could come to regard the differences between men and women, not as threatening, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4471.34s)]
*  but mostly as just actually funny and trivial and interesting and quirky. If we could come to be [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4479.820000000001s)]
*  basically more comfortable and less neurotic about sex differences, I think that that would [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4487.5s)]
*  do no end of good to our relationships. Louise Perry, thank you so much for making [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4493.26s)]
*  the time to be on Honestly, despite the fact that you just moved and are sitting in some [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4498.14s)]
*  corner of your house and really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Happy Valentine's Day. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaeHJ7csoA&t=4501.82s)]
