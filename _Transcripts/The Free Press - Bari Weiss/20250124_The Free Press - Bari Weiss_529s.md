# DEBATE: Trump Reverses Biden-Era Transgender Policies | Batya Ungar-Sargon & Brianna Wu
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE)
*  Let's talk about some of the big executive orders that Trump signed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=0.0s)]
*  And I want to start with his order on restoring biological reality, I believe it's called. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=3.72s)]
*  We broke that news on Sunday before he signed it on Monday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=8.42s)]
*  And that order does a few things. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=12.68s)]
*  It defines men and women, talks about how there's only two genders. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=14.32s)]
*  It ends the housing of biological men and women's prisons. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=18.98s)]
*  It ends the practice of self ID on passports, among other things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=22.14s)]
*  Brianna, of course, I want to start with you here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=26.52s)]
*  How does this order affect you personally if it does at all? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=29.94s)]
*  Well, there's a real question in federal law right now if I'm a man or a woman. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=33.54s)]
*  My birth certificate says female driver's license, passport. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=39.14s)]
*  I've had vaginoplasty, married to a man for 17 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=43.7s)]
*  You know, socially, it's how people treat me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=49.06s)]
*  But according to some readings of this, that's a real question. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=51.82s)]
*  So I want to jump to a really 30,000 foot view here, Barry. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=57.18s)]
*  And when you are thinking about why did we pass these laws in the first place to allow [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=62.06s)]
*  people like me the ability to change our gender, why did you have so many conservatives back [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=66.82s)]
*  on the day that helped make this state law and federal law? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=72.86s)]
*  And the reason is it doesn't help society if you have people like me and you don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=76.58s)]
*  to deal with their mental health issues and integrate back in, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=83.1s)]
*  We should be able to get jobs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=87.82s)]
*  We should be able to just blend and go about our day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=89.86s)]
*  Like I've been very thoroughly employed for the last 17 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=92.46s)]
*  I pay taxes, happily married. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  I am clearly a better credit to America this way than I was as a drug addicted shut it, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  you know, when I was really broken by this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  At the same time, you know, there's some good stuff in this executive order. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  And I know that's going to upset a lot of my transgender friends to say, but there has [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=114.5s)]
*  been a fringe effort in the last years to legislate sex out of existence. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  And progressives have been very successful at that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=124.66s)]
*  I don't want an America where women as a class, a biological class, cannot get the rights [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=127.26s)]
*  and protections they need because a bunch of gender ideologues have some theories about that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=135.56s)]
*  They're real conversations we need to have about lesbian spaces and, you know, prison [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=141.6s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=146.8s)]
*  And I welcome that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=147.8s)]
*  But it just feels like this is so cruel and so extreme that you're just, you're essentially [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=149.32s)]
*  turning everyone in the community into this creature that does not get dignity and doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=155.44s)]
*  have a path to a normal life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=162.84s)]
*  And I don't think that's where most Americans are. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=165.02s)]
*  Brianna, you're one of the people that has sort of really been pushing back against the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=167.24s)]
*  excesses of, let's just say, parts of the trans activist movement that is dying on the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=171.62s)]
*  hill of things like child, childhood gender transition, the inclusion of trans women and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=178.34s)]
*  girls in girls sports. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=186.34s)]
*  And you've you've basically said, and forgive me if I'm caricaturing it, you'll correct [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=187.86s)]
*  that the reasons that this is bad is not just because it's unfair to women and girls or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=193.12s)]
*  children who don't know who could make irrevocable changes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=199.0s)]
*  It's that the backlash to these kinds of excessive out of touch policies will will in the end [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=204.94s)]
*  were down terribly to transgender adults. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=213.74s)]
*  Do you feel like this executive order was sort of that warning coming to fruition? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a real wake up call for trans people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=221.86s)]
*  I think that's dead on. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=224.34s)]
*  And that is how I feel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=225.34s)]
*  Barry Free Press had an excellent story this week about Biden's decision to put natal males [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=226.34s)]
*  with penises in, you know, in women's prisons, like some of them with a very frightening [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  history of sexual abuse. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=238.3s)]
*  That doesn't help. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  It's a evil. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=241.18s)]
*  B it doesn't help like trans women like me. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=243.06s)]
*  We want to integrate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=246.78000000000003s)]
*  We want to I don't want that to be the way that people think of me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=247.98s)]
*  And you know, the thing is this progressive idea, this what I call gender ideology, it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=252.5s)]
*  is so extreme that is literally confusing children and telling them it's giving them [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=258.78s)]
*  propaganda that says you can have no gender if you don't want any, even when they don't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=264.62s)]
*  have those questions. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=269.16s)]
*  It's confusing them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=270.3s)]
*  It's putting women in positions where they are not safe in prison. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=272.06s)]
*  It is, you know, it is threatening women's sports. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=276.98s)]
*  It is really hurting the lesbian community. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think there's a real adult conversation that we need to have. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=283.74s)]
*  If the trans community were any smarter, we would look at this executive order and say [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=288.26s)]
*  this is a very clear signal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  What we are pushing is not sellable to the American people and we need to change course. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=295.3s)]
*  It's so frustrating to me that everyone I know is just quadrupling down on the old messages [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  that aren't working. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=306.38s)]
*  So I don't know where we go from here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=307.5s)]
*  It feels like we're in a deadlock. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  Something's got to change. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=312.62s)]
*  I see it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=314.14s)]
*  A lot of normal trans women and men I know see it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=314.98s)]
*  They're begging for some new leadership. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=318.14s)]
*  I don't know how we got there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=320.54s)]
*  Batia, Peter, do you want to weigh in on this one? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=323.1s)]
*  I mean, talk about leading. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=328.7s)]
*  I do think that this is where most Americans are at and that this is an attempt to do a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  kind of reset. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=335.98s)]
*  It does not preclude having the kinds of conversations Brianna wants to have down the road. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=337.06s)]
*  But in terms of practical application, I think this is a good step towards getting a lot [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  of the stuff that you actually do want, Brianna, like protecting women's spaces, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  protecting lesbian spaces. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=351.5s)]
*  I mean, that all has to start with a definition. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=353.06s)]
*  And I do think that that definition does track clearly with how most Americans feel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=355.62s)]
*  You know, the polling shows that the vast majority of Americans want trans people to be [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=360.62s)]
*  protected from discrimination in housing and in the workforce. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=365.26s)]
*  And I'm talking 80 plus percent of Americans want that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=368.74s)]
*  But the numbers really, really drop when it comes to things like trans women and women's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=371.86s)]
*  sports, women's prisons, you know, protecting women's spaces. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=376.34s)]
*  Women also have rights that I think we could probably agree on 90 percent of the cases. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=380.62s)]
*  In some instances, the trans agenda has actually taken away some of those rights for women. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=385.94s)]
*  So, you know, in terms of saying, you know, drawing line and saying, you know, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  as the federal government, we want to start correcting for this overreach. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=395.85999999999996s)]
*  That has to start with a definition. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  And that definition, I think, does track pretty clearly with how most Americans feel about it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=401.58s)]
*  So I think that this probably was met with relief, not just by a lot of Republicans and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=405.94s)]
*  conservatives, but by a lot of Democrats and a lot of liberals who have felt like they [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  can't say how they feel about this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=414.82s)]
*  And yeah, this is a moment, I think, of real leadership. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=417.34s)]
*  But I want to challenge you on that, because there are parts of this that really go very [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=420.7s)]
*  far about you. And, you know, on election night, you told me that if Trump came for me [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=424.74s)]
*  and my rights, like you would stand with people like me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=428.86s)]
*  And I don't think like I don't want to get into the weeds on passport policy, but it used to be [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=431.94s)]
*  in the Bush administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=437.42s)]
*  I applied for a passport and I wanted to get an F on it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=438.82s)]
*  And they denied that because I had not had vaginoplasty. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=442.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=446.26s)]
*  So they changed that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=446.66s)]
*  Well, I got that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  Then they changed it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  Hillary Clinton actually changed that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=452.42s)]
*  So you could go apply for a passport and just say whatever you wanted on there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=454.1s)]
*  That's also not the right policy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=458.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=460.86s)]
*  I think we agree that there should be at the very least you should be on a medical pathway [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=461.18s)]
*  before getting F on your legal identification there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=466.62s)]
*  The problem is if you do not give some trans women a path to just normalcy where we can go about our [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=471.18s)]
*  day, we can get a job without, you know, making being trans the focus and we can just disappear, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=479.3s)]
*  deal with a mental health issue and go forward with their lives. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=484.86s)]
*  I think you don't understand just how much it traps you because you only get defined as this one [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=489.38s)]
*  thing by so many people and they will never let you be anything else, which is why so many trans [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  women just don't talk about this stuff. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZCEsgpqmE&t=502.9s)]
