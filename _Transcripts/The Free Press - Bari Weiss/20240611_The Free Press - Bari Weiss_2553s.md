Two years ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. It was the largest military attack on a European country since World War II. Reliable casualty figures are hard to come by, but U.S. intelligence officials estimated last August that as many as 200,000 Russians and Ukrainians had been killed in he conflict, with an estimated 10 million people displaced. 

Congress has allotted n $175 billion in aid for Ukraine since the war began. 

But our guest today, former Russian MP Ilya Ponomarev, says that we need to do more than merely send aid. He insists that it is imperative to topple Vladimir Putin’s regime altogether. And he is actively working to do just that.

CORRECTION: At 14:55, the date reads August 20, 2020. The correct date is August 20, 2022.

# Want Peace in Europe? 'Eliminate Putin' Says Former Russian Official
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI)
*  I'm Michael Moynihan for the Free Press in New York, and this is Honestly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today I'm sitting down with Ilya Ponimarev, former Russian lawmaker turned dissident. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=5.72s)]
*  Ponimarev was a member of the Russian state Duma from 2007 to 2016, where he was the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=10.88s)]
*  only member to vote against the 2014 annexation of Crimea. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=16.16s)]
*  Exiled to Ukraine since 2016, he's the political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a volunteer [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=20.68s)]
*  militia of Russian dissidents and defectors. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Ponimarev continues to help facilitate high-risk, direct military operations against the Kremlin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=29.04s)]
*  and he insists that such drastic measures are necessary to topple Putin's regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=34.32s)]
*  He's the author of the provocatively titled book, Does Putin Have to Die? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=38.8s)]
*  The story of how Russia becomes a democracy after losing to Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=42.72s)]
*  In our conversation, we talk about Ponimarev's life as a dissident, why the Russian regime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=47.64s)]
*  is more fragile than it looks, and what comes next in the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=52.04s)]
*  Ilya Ponimarev, welcome to Honestly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=59.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=64.44s)]
*  So give us a sense of sort of why you're sitting across from me, how you came to this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=65.44s)]
*  point from somebody in the Duma to being this opposition figure. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=70.24s)]
*  Well, while I'm sitting here because you have invited me, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=74.72s)]
*  No, but seriously speaking, I always consider myself to be an entrepreneur. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Who is the entrepreneur? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=85.76s)]
*  It's the person who changes the world. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=86.76s)]
*  And I always wanted it to be the better place. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=89.28s)]
*  And my childhood was at the time when it was the last years of the Soviet Union, and it [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=91.92s)]
*  collapsed right in front of my eyes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=97.92s)]
*  I took active part in Perestroika, and at that time I went into business, technology business, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=99.84s)]
*  computers, high-tech stuff, because I believe that's where I will change the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=106.08s)]
*  When Vladimir Putin came to power and there was no more illusions, and he disbanded the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=112.16s)]
*  best Russian TV station called NCV. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=118.56s)]
*  And at that time, my last business was supposed to be co-invested by Ted Turner of CNN. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=121.12s)]
*  And Ted volunteered to be the mediator between Vladimir Putin and the NCV guys. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=128.48s)]
*  They're journalists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=133.04s)]
*  They got screwed up, obviously, for this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=134.56s)]
*  You know, left Russia, said no more investments in Russia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=137.52s)]
*  So my business was screwed as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=140.4s)]
*  And I said, OK, so I have to get to politics and fix it myself. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=142.0s)]
*  And since that time, I'm in politics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=146.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin comes to power in 2000. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=148.56s)]
*  You and your book reprint a speech that he gives to the Bundestag in Germany. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=154.32s)]
*  Good Lord, that's a perfect speech. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=168.0s)]
*  I agree with everything in it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=170.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=171.28s)]
*  That's why I put it in my book. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=171.84s)]
*  Did you believe this stuff at the time? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=174.24s)]
*  Obviously, when you look now backwards, you understand that we all were those frogs [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=176.88s)]
*  which are being gradually boiled by Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=184.64s)]
*  Obviously, at that time, I didn't feel like we are in a dictatorship or an authoritarianism. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=189.76s)]
*  I just thought that it's a flawed democracy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=195.28s)]
*  I thought that Vladimir Putin is just a servant of the oligarchs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=198.88s)]
*  And I still think, by the way, that that was the main reason why he was chosen [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  to actually defend the property. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=207.76s)]
*  But nevertheless, I thought that through elections, we will be able to fix it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  And at that time, I joined the Communist Party, who was the main opposition to Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin always was very much to the right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  So I joined the left-wing force. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=223.6s)]
*  And we were thinking that in 2003, we will be able to win the elections. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=226.24s)]
*  But you don't lament the end of the Soviet Union, do you? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=231.44s)]
*  No. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=236.72s)]
*  You passed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=237.04s)]
*  You hesitated a bit. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=238.4s)]
*  Yes, I hesitated because I would say it's a controversial issue. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=239.68s)]
*  So when there was a referendum in 1991, whether we should keep the Soviet Union or not, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=243.12s)]
*  I actually voted against keeping it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=249.28s)]
*  And at that time, I was very actively with the tricolor flag, the new flag of Russia, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=251.76s)]
*  and in 1991 and 1993, I was for Yeltsin at the time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=258.32s)]
*  Now, I think that the reason why the state collapsed was differently than what we believed in. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=266.24s)]
*  And for many former Soviet republics, that was a positive thing because they felt themselves [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=272.56s)]
*  being colonies and they became independent. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=280.88s)]
*  For Russians in Russia, that was a tragedy when they lost a lot and didn't gain much. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=284.32s)]
*  And that was one of the reasons of this resentment that we see now with Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=291.92s)]
*  2014. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=300.4s)]
*  Russia annexes Crimea. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=302.88s)]
*  And Donetsk, Luhansk, the little green men who are fighting against Ukrainian sovereignty, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=305.36s)]
*  this is put up for a vote in the Duma. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  You voted against it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=315.2s)]
*  You were the only person who voted against it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=318.8s)]
*  Tell me about that feeling when you push that button and said, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=319.76s)]
*  no, I'm not going to stand for this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=323.2s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  And for two weeks before that, I actually did my best to avoid it somehow. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=327.92s)]
*  I was calling all the phones that I had. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  How do you try to avoid it? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=335.92s)]
*  I was hoping that he is bluffing because for me, it was illogical. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=337.6s)]
*  It would be very bad for Russian people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  It would lead into the war. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a bloodshed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  And I saw previously when under Medvedev, Russia invaded Georgia. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  Still, it was something outside Russia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=358.24s)]
*  With the Crimea, it was a direct annexation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=361.84s)]
*  So it was a real imperialistic act. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=365.52s)]
*  And surely I was very much against, but I was thinking, so how to get around this, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=367.92s)]
*  how to convince the leadership that it is a mistake. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=374.8s)]
*  And I can tell you that if it would not be my wife, I don't know how would I vote. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=379.12s)]
*  But because I understand that it would be physically dangerous for my family. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=385.2s)]
*  And leaving to the parliament that morning of March 18th, 2014, my wife told me, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  if you will not vote against, you shouldn't come back home. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  And with that, she lifted the responsibility off my shoulders that I shouldn't think about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  my family, that I should act just according to my principles. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  That's amazing, Shichel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=413.04s)]
*  You're not going to come over here. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=415.04s)]
*  If you vote for... [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=416.88s)]
*  I mean, you sort of understand what kind of political culture you live in when you press [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=418.24s)]
*  that button and realize that you might no longer be a Russian in a way. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=424.0s)]
*  You might never see Russia again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=429.36s)]
*  It's actually funny because the guy, so we are sitting there like on the benches. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=430.96s)]
*  So there were two guys sitting next to me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=436.16s)]
*  And the guy who was sitting immediately next to me when I was pressing the button, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=437.92s)]
*  he tried to grab my hand and pull it off the button. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=444.0s)]
*  So that I would not vote. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=448.32s)]
*  Did you know him? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=448.88s)]
*  No, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=449.44s)]
*  He was friendly. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  You were friendly with him? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=451.52s)]
*  No, it's not friend, but obviously we're in one faction. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=452.08s)]
*  So obviously I know him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=455.44s)]
*  So I had to press it with another hand, that button, and then grab my voting card so that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=456.64s)]
*  he would not be able to press another button. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=462.88s)]
*  And he was saying, what have you done? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=466.0s)]
*  I will be arrested after that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=469.52s)]
*  He was arrested. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  He was arrested, but you weren't. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=471.12s)]
*  I escaped because Putin, you see, Putin is a mobster. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=472.64s)]
*  He's a gangster. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  This guy has a mobster psychology. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=479.52s)]
*  He's like a good father of the gang. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=481.84s)]
*  And in his eyes, I'm kind of a decent enemy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=484.24s)]
*  I'm a person who was against from the very beginning. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=489.36s)]
*  Even say Boris Nemtsov, the very dignified man, he was once in his camp and was one of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=491.76s)]
*  his economic masterminds. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=500.0s)]
*  And then he switched. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=501.44s)]
*  For whatever reason, it doesn't matter. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=502.96s)]
*  For Putin, you know, that means that Boris is a traitor. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=504.4s)]
*  And that's why Boris was eventually killed. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=507.84s)]
*  Myself, I was always against him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=513.76s)]
*  That's why he preferred just to kick me out of the country, but do not punish. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=514.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how your wife or your family thinks about this, but [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=520.0s)]
*  I mean, I go down the list of people that you've known and you've been friends with. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=523.52s)]
*  Alexei Navalny, Boris Nemtsov. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=529.04s)]
*  I don't know if you knew Alexander Litvinenko. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=531.92s)]
*  He was my good friend. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  Good friend. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  The Skripals, I don't know if you knew them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  Anna Paula Skyler. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  They're all dead. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=540.88s)]
*  They've all been murdered. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=542.56s)]
*  So the long arm of Vladimir Putin reaches outside of the country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=544.4s)]
*  You're not really safe anywhere. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=550.4s)]
*  Do you worry about this? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=552.56s)]
*  I was already approached four times by the assassins. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  Explain that to me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=559.28s)]
*  Approached four times. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  They tried. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  They tried to get me. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=564.0s)]
*  In Ukraine? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  Three times in Ukraine, once outside Ukraine. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  Can you tell me where it was outside of Ukraine? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=571.52s)]
*  Prefer not to? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=574.56s)]
*  I mean, we've had opponents of the Putin regime killed in Germany. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  In the United Kingdom. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=584.56s)]
*  No, right now, firstly, security forces are on high alert. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=586.16s)]
*  Secondly, I have very good detail myself. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=590.64s)]
*  Expensive, though, isn't it? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, but some people help in this regard. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  I would actually prefer them to invest more money in the actual resistance fighting. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=601.12s)]
*  But different people, they have different preferences of what they are comfortable with spending on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=606.16s)]
*  The name of your book really shocks people sometimes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=614.56s)]
*  When I was reading that, somebody that I was with said, what is the name of that book? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=618.24s)]
*  You talk about pretty radical solutions and say that sitting around and having interviews [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=623.36s)]
*  only and just little parlor games is not enough. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=629.6s)]
*  You can't just sit there and do nothing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=632.72s)]
*  What moment did you consider the nonviolent resistance a failure and decide that you had [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=634.8s)]
*  to move towards violent resistance? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=642.0s)]
*  The decisive moment was 2012. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=644.96s)]
*  Particularly, the events on the 6th of May of 2012 before the third Putin's inauguration. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=651.04s)]
*  That's when we had many people arrested. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=658.64s)]
*  That's when I personally for myself decided, so this is it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=662.32s)]
*  We know that it's not working. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=667.12s)]
*  With the traditional Russian liberals, it's not going to fly. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=670.0s)]
*  We need to build something else. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=674.48s)]
*  But obviously, again, as I said, people were not ready. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  But with the war, the situation changed dramatically. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=680.4s)]
*  2012, you were out there in the street in these protests and that failed basically. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=684.48s)]
*  Now you're at the point of armed resistance. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=691.12s)]
*  I would say that I myself personally was always thinking that the armed resistance [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=692.88s)]
*  was more efficient against Putin because Putin is a security guy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=699.12s)]
*  He's a security colonel and the guy's mindset is different. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=702.56s)]
*  He would not be scared by just crowds on the streets and he was never scared of that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=707.3599999999999s)]
*  I think that we all need to understand just one thing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  By just giving money to Ukraine, helping Ukraine, we are doing the right thing, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=715.76s)]
*  but we are treating not the origin of the war. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=719.28s)]
*  The origin of the war is in Moscow. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  The origin of the war is with Vladimir Putin. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  To stop the war, it's not enough to restore territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=730.32s)]
*  It's just that you are pushing the front line a little bit further eastwards, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=735.44s)]
*  but it still would be the front line and missiles would still be flying. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  The only way how to bring peace to Europe in general and to Ukraine in particular [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=744.72s)]
*  is to eliminate Putin and Putinism, which is most importantly as a political system. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=750.6400000000001s)]
*  So the movement is called, and correct me if I'm wrong here, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=757.76s)]
*  the Russian Republican Army, is that right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=763.52s)]
*  No, we have just different units. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  One of the units is called National Republican Army. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  National Republican Army. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's one of the units and that's one of the urban resistance, urban guerrilla network. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=774.16s)]
*  See, that makes me think of the Irish Republican Army. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=781.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was the reason why the name was there. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=783.68s)]
*  But the Irish Republican Army targeted civilians. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=786.4s)]
*  What are the targets that you think are actually acceptable? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, do civilians factor into this at all? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=794.88s)]
*  No, I'm definitely very much against any acts of terror at any circumstances. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=797.76s)]
*  We have a political unit which is called Congress of People's Deputies, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=805.04s)]
*  which is like a shadow Russian parliament. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=810.96s)]
*  It adopted so-called act of resistance where it actually discussed what ways of resistance [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=814.0s)]
*  are normal, acceptable, and which are not. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=820.64s)]
*  Everything that is targeted against people who finance, organize, fight in the war is okay. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  That's even kind of intellectual foot soldiers in the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  Putin Army, like somebody like Alexander Dugin, for instance. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=837.28s)]
*  Alexander Dugin is the person who says that he invented this war. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=840.72s)]
*  He is the chief ideologue of this war. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=844.72s)]
*  He openly says that he is a Russian fascist. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=847.52s)]
*  That's why he's obviously a target. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=852.88s)]
*  It's very easy to see what is acceptable and what is not. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=857.52s)]
*  Just draw a parallel with Nazi Germany. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=860.96s)]
*  Alexander Dugin would be a type of the editor-in-chief of Völkische Biobachter, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  the main SS newspaper. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=870.08s)]
*  It would be like Radio of Thousand Hills in Rwanda. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=874.96s)]
*  They are the warmongers. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=880.4s)]
*  They are as guilty as a particular security officer or soldier at the field. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=882.08s)]
*  They all spill blood. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=889.76s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=891.12s)]
*  When you saw the bomb go off that killed Dugin's daughter, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=891.52s)]
*  how did you feel about that? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=896.88s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=897.84s)]
*  Frankly, I felt bad about it because obviously it's done by people in Russia. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=899.0400000000001s)]
*  They were making these decisions by themselves. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=905.44s)]
*  They picked up the targets. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=909.44s)]
*  Obviously, again, they were targeting them both. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=910.88s)]
*  What I learned later, I didn't know about them picking up that target. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=914.4s)]
*  Darya Dugin, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, whom you mentioned, was the same fascist. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  She was her father's operative. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=927.28s)]
*  She was directly calling for assassination of Azov fighters in Russian prisons and were [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  fortunately successful in that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=936.48s)]
*  That was the reason, by the way, why she was chosen to be the target because [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=938.0s)]
*  on her hands was death of 60-something Azov fighters in Donetsk region. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  Alexeus Dugin [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=949.12s)]
*  She was chosen as the target. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  It was reported initially that it was an accident that they were trying to target [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=952.48s)]
*  her father and they made a mistake. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=957.28s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=959.04s)]
*  No, to my information, they both were targets. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, her father was the primary target and she was the secondary target. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=963.12s)]
*  It happened the way it happened. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=968.4s)]
*  Many people said, maybe it's Lord interfered so that the father would suffer in the worst [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=970.4s)]
*  possible way and he definitely deserves this. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=978.16s)]
*  She was not an innocent civilian. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  She's a lady and she's young and whatever. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=985.1199999999999s)]
*  That's why I said I feel very bad about that happened, but I never had any hesitations [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=988.7199999999999s)]
*  that she was guilty. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=994.8s)]
*  Alexeus Dantos [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=995.68s)]
*  Are you a soldier? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=996.4s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  I enlisted in Ukrainian army the very first day of war. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  Alexeus Dantos [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1002.0s)]
*  Those first days when the Russian military is trying to take Kiev and thankfully failing [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1002.2399999999999s)]

*  Soterios Dantos [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1011.84s)]
*  What is the feeling going through your head when you think, I am a Russian. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1014.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not a Putinist. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1019.36s)]
*  I'm not part of this gangster regime in the Kremlin, but I am a Russian [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1020.4s)]
*  and I'm going to be shooting a gun at Russians. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1025.04s)]
*  How does that make you feel when you do that? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1028.16s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1029.52s)]
*  You know, about this in particular, I feel nothing. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1030.64s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1033.52s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1034.08s)]
*  And I explain you why. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1034.32s)]
*  Because this is something that I digested and processed long time ago. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  During World War II, would you consider, for example, Willy Brandt, the future [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1042.0800000000002s)]
*  counselor of Germany to be the traitor because he was anti-fascist and was inside the allied [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1048.48s)]
*  army fighting against Germans and killing Germans? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1055.76s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1058.96s)]
*  No, obviously he was not a traitor. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  He was anti-fascist who was fighting with fascism. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1061.92s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1064.8s)]
*  You have to have some sympathy to imagine at this point [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1066.0s)]
*  after Ukraine has become essentially a meat grinder for the Russian army where people are being [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1069.84s)]
*  called up and pulled out of little villages and prisons too. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1075.84s)]
*  But, you know, young people who have no interest in being there but are forced by the state to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1079.52s)]
*  pick up a Koleshnikov and go to try to kill Ukrainians against their will, right? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1084.24s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of tough, isn't it? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1088.48s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1090.56s)]
*  Some against their will, some not. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1091.2s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1092.72s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1093.52s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1093.92s)]
*  Many people are doing this just for money and it's really bad, but actually it's quite [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1094.16s)]
*  understandable because this state actually put Russian people in such a misery that they [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1100.88s)]
*  actually are ready to shoot at their brothers, which speak the same language, the same religion, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1109.28s)]
*  the same culture, and just because they need to feed their families and to survive. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  And some of them are even glad to die because then their family would get the insurances, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1123.52s)]
*  the compensation packages, which would help their wives and sisters and mothers to get [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1130.0s)]
*  a normal apartment and get a decent life. And that's the motivation of a significant portion [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1137.52s)]
*  of the Russian army. I would actually say that there is one third of the Russian army, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1144.96s)]
*  which are prisoners who want to get out of prison. Secondly, it's those people who want [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1150.24s)]
*  to make money and only one third are the people who were just drafted to the front lines. And [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1155.04s)]
*  that's awful, but the nation needs to have a wake-up call and it's all result of Putin's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1163.84s)]
*  actions. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1171.04s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1171.44s)]
*  What did you make of Vladimir Putin in your interactions with him? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1171.68s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1174.32s)]
*  He's a brilliant psychologist, just wonderful, the best I know, the best communicator. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1174.64s)]
*  So when you're talking like this to him, you feel like finally you found somebody who truly [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1183.8400000000001s)]
*  understands you, better than your wife. But- [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1189.76s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1194.16s)]
*  Did you actually fall for that at some point because he was so good at it? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1194.5600000000002s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1197.5200000000002s)]
*  No, I knew that that would happen. So I was kind of like- [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1197.68s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1202.72s)]
*  Ready for it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1202.8000000000002s)]
*  Ready and exploring this and even getting pleasure. When I resisted this and he was [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1203.84s)]
*  shocked that I was resisting because these charms were not working. At that moment he [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  was expecting me to ask something of him and he wanted to recruit me. That was his objective. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1217.04s)]
*  And when I said like this in his face that we are still enemies and will be- [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1228.8s)]
*  But you resist? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1230.24s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1230.96s)]
*  That was 2013. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1234.72s)]
*  He'd already killed some of your friends. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1236.32s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1238.56s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1238.8s)]
*  Livydenko in particular. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1238.96s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1240.08s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I said. And so we were adversary enemies. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1240.24s)]
*  Just at that time, yes, there was no war. And at that time I managed to get a deal through him [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1248.0s)]
*  that he would allow the Russian opposition to run for the local positions, local mayor's offices. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  I always thought that it would be very useful because that would allow us to get experience [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1266.1599999999999s)]
*  and exposure and certain profile authority in Russia. So that was the point of our discussion, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1270.48s)]
*  but we still, we were enemies and that's what I told him. And he was kind of shocked because he [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1277.6s)]
*  was expecting me to ask him to actually make me a mayor. So to falsify the elections in my favor. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1282.32s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  Which many people I presume do. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1291.12s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1292.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk a bit about Ukraine and the war in Ukraine. I mean, obviously this is something [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1294.8s)]
*  that Americans are paying pretty close attention to. Where are we now? I mean, there was a lot of [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1298.32s)]
*  excitement at the beginning that the Ukrainians were really punching above their weight and doing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1304.8s)]
*  very well militarily. That has kind of died down and people have a sort of more depressed look at [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1308.48s)]
*  this now and say, you know, they're going to lose territory. I mean, 18% of I think of the territory [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1315.84s)]
*  outside of Crimea is occupied by Russia right now. I mean, what do you make of the war at this [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1322.4s)]
*  moment? Is it winnable if the appropriate munitions come in from the West? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1329.28s)]
*  Look, all together, the whole thing went way better than I expected it to go in the very beginning. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1336.4s)]
*  The very first night I was personally ready to die. And I didn't think that we will see [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1343.44s)]
*  another day of light. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1349.92s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1351.76s)]
*  Did you think you were going to die that night? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1351.92s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1353.28s)]
*  Yes, it was. It was tough. And I think that we were pretty close to it because [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1354.08s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1359.2s)]
*  And you saw combat that evening, close combat rather than, you know, bombs falling on your head. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1359.76s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1364.24s)]
*  We saw the combat. Yes. And it was one of units within my regiment which went to fight in the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1364.8s)]
*  Kostomel airport, which was the key battle of the first two days, three days next to Kiev. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1372.48s)]
*  Now we are at the stalemate. And if the same military assistance that is coming now would [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1379.52s)]
*  have been delivered to us in March 2022, we would be already in Moscow and the war would [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1386.72s)]
*  be already over. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1392.08s)]
*  But now it's sort of World War I, nobody's moving, everybody's dying. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1393.92s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1397.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, now it's World War I and it's a very dense situation. And still there are way more people [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1397.8400000000001s)]
*  dying on the Russian side than on the Ukrainian side. But there is no significant movement and [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1404.64s)]
*  Putin would be just trying to carve out sort of additional territory for him to prepare for his [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1410.88s)]
*  anticipation that Trump would come to office and would force Ukrainians to make a ceasefire. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1417.68s)]
*  That's his like best bet. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1423.68s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  That's his best case scenario. How do you think it ends? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1426.0s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1428.8s)]
*  I think that he may just move ahead for, you know, another dozen kilometers and pay this with [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1429.52s)]
*  another hundred thousand human lives, which is awful and terrible, but that does not create any [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1438.16s)]
*  strategic difference. So every dead Ukrainian is taking four lives of Russians with him. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1446.48s)]
*  So that's going nowhere. And that's exactly why I am saying that we need to think about [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1457.68s)]
*  the revolt in Moscow. That's how the war would end. That's the most efficient weapon. That's [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1465.6s)]
*  the most efficient weapon in terms of human lives. And that's the most [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1472.08s)]
*  efficient return on every dollar that we may spend on this war. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1479.28s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1484.24s)]
*  There was a big debate in Congress about this funding and this funding ultimately went through. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1485.36s)]
*  And let's address the people on the left of the Democratic Party because that's kind of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1492.48s)]
*  your constituency in a way. You're a man on the left. People on the left of the Democratic [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1497.12s)]
*  Party say this isn't our fight. Why are we spending money in Ukraine, enormous amounts of money, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  when so many things in America need to get done, homelessness and welfare stuff, etc. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1508.9599999999998s)]
*  Make the case to me that they're wrong, that American taxpayers should be putting up enormous [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  amounts of money for the defense of Ukraine and particularly when it's at a point of attrition. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1521.9199999999998s)]
*  And look, when I hear the position of many people which claim themselves to be leftists [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1526.8s)]
*  across the globe, on Ukraine, on Israel, on many other matters, I feel ashamed that I am also [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1535.04s)]
*  leftist because I don't believe they are leftists. That's not leftist. Leftist is about power to the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1541.12s)]
*  people. It's about fighting the imperialism with arms, with all your might, with all your passion, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1549.84s)]
*  fighting against inequality. And that's all what Putin is all about. He is one of the wealthiest [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1558.9599999999998s)]
*  persons on this planet which abuses other nations around him and both inside Russia, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1565.84s)]
*  which is undemocratic and as authoritarian that one can be. So every person who identifies himself [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  as a left should see him as his enemy number one. I mean, he was a very conservative individual in [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1581.04s)]
*  so many ways when it comes to religion and things like that. I mean, so it's not surprising to me [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1588.48s)]
*  that people on the American right, the kind of fright. For right, I have no surprises. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1593.12s)]
*  You have no surprises. Yes, yes. For right, it's right. Still, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1597.28s)]
*  I think that Putin is very hypocritical, but I at least can understand that Putin may present [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1600.96s)]
*  this image. So I understand that people may at least be fooled by this. But with leftists, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1606.72s)]
*  they do not understand because for me the situation is crystal clear. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1613.44s)]
*  Soterios Dantos Why do you think people like Tucker Carlson [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1617.2s)]
*  go to a country like Russia and have videos of them saying, look at these hamburgers are amazing, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1620.3200000000002s)]
*  these subways are perfect. We could do just like they do if we followed Putin's type of plan. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1625.76s)]
*  Soterios Dantos You know, one guy in Washington, DC introduced me to a term, axis of jerks that [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1633.28s)]
*  Putin is building. He meant that Putin, it's like Russia, North Korea, China, Iran, Venezuela, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1640.4s)]
*  you name it. But I think that Tucker Carlson can make a separate part of that axis. Of course, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1648.0s)]
*  he is what would be called in the past a useful idiot. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1654.96s)]
*  Soterios Dantos Correct. Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1658.96s)]
*  One of the most popular videos on the Ukraine War that I've seen on YouTube is an American [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1660.72s)]
*  professor at the University of Chicago named John Mercheimer, who you've probably come across. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1666.8s)]
*  Soterios Dantos I know him. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1670.72s)]
*  Soterios Dantos John Mercheimer has a very long argument that says, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1671.12s)]
*  you know, Russia has a right to do what it did. The expansion of NATO and the threat of NATO [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1674.56s)]
*  expansion is putting pressure on Russia in their backyard. You would not like if they were doing [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1681.28s)]
*  that in Mexico or Canada or something, enemies on your border. So it's understandable. What do you [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1686.56s)]
*  make of that increasingly common argument that I hear in America? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1692.6399999999999s)]
*  Soterios Dantos Now, look, there is a fundamental contradiction to that argument. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1696.72s)]
*  Soterios Dantos Because when Putin was coming to power in the year 2000, his foreign policy agenda [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1704.16s)]
*  was based on exactly three pillars. He wanted to become a member of WTO, he wanted to become a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1713.04s)]
*  member of the European Union, and he wanted to become a member of NATO. Which means that Putin [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1720.96s)]
*  himself never saw NATO as a hostile alliance to Russia. He started talking about this when [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1726.72s)]
*  it became useful for him for totally different internal political reasons. And that means, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1736.32s)]
*  you know, that there was no danger from any expansion of NATO to Russia. Actually, I always [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1744.4s)]
*  was totally for Russia becoming part of NATO. But when he was denied with his personal ambitions, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1752.48s)]
*  then he started working against. So it's not a fundamental problem. That's why these arguments [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1762.24s)]
*  that it was a threat. No, sorry, it's a bullshit. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  Soterios Dantos Why invade Ukraine and sacrifice so many [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1770.64s)]
*  Russian lives and potentially destabilize your own government by making the Russian people? I [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1775.2s)]
*  mean, remember the numbers of people who died in the war in Afghanistan or a percentage of the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1780.64s)]
*  number of Russians who died in that almost precipitated the end of the Soviet Union. That [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  was a very, very big problem for the Soviet leadership. I mean, why take that risk? I mean, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1790.72s)]
*  is it a desire to rebuild the Soviet Union in some sort of geographic way? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1795.92s)]
*  Soterios Dantos I don't think so. I think it's just a vicious [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1800.88s)]
*  circle that Putin submerged himself to. In the year 2005, his candidate running for [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1804.88s)]
*  Ukrainian elections, Yanukovych, was kicked out by Maidan revolution. In 2014, the same Yanukovych [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1814.4s)]
*  for the second time was ousted by the same Maidan revolution. And that means it's a message for [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1822.88s)]
*  Russian elites that Putin's candidate is weak, that Putin made their own bet, that Putin is [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1829.84s)]
*  mistaken, that Putin is not in control of the situation. And that's why he needed to do [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1837.9199999999998s)]
*  something bold to overcome this. And that's how the annexation of Crimea happened. And then, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1843.52s)]
*  tit for tat, it was an escalation, Ukrainians pushed back, Putin escalated. Then it somehow [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1851.1999999999998s)]
*  subsided. But then Putin's popularity, which surged after the annexation of Crimea, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1859.36s)]
*  we need to be frank about this, it started to go down again. So he needed, you know, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1865.9199999999998s)]
*  just another drug to be put into that system and to experience another surge. And that's how the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  next confrontation with Ukraine came into the picture. Soterios Dantos [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1879.36s)]
*  Why is Russia seemingly so immune to democracy? There seems some special path in Russia, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1884.24s)]
*  that in 91, we were very excited, 93, the coup is put down, we're even more excited. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1892.32s)]
*  And then it all just goes to shit to say, you know, just be honest about it. And we get Putin [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1897.36s)]
*  and we're almost 25 years into that. And we had the Bolshevik revolution. And that was a nightmare [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1903.1200000000001s)]
*  for most people, I would say. The czars were nightmares for most people. What is it about [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1908.56s)]
*  Russia that prevents democracy from taking hold? Soterios Dantos [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1915.52s)]
*  No, I think there is nothing special. Soterios Dantos [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1919.12s)]
*  Just bad luck. Soterios Dantos [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1922.08s)]
*  No, it's not also, it's not a question of luck. It's a question of logical [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1923.84s)]
*  Soterios Dantos [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1931.28s)]
*  result of how the economy is structured. The foundation, the lifestyle is what is primary. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1933.6s)]
*  And the political system is what is coming on top. Always democracy was sacrificed [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1940.24s)]
*  towards personal greed and ambitions and career inclinations and stuff like that. That's why [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1948.08s)]
*  I think that for once, that's why I was writing this book, is actually to design the system [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1959.68s)]
*  beforehand and with people who would not be personally benefiting from the system as those [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1967.76s)]
*  who would be coming in power. We drafted the new constitution, we drafted the first basic set of [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  laws and drafting the new legislation for the new Russia, which would start working the very first [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1981.44s)]
*  day after the war. So our Congress of People's Deputies is designed to be the transitional [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1987.12s)]
*  parliament, which would stop functioning after the transition period is over. And that's a short [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=1995.12s)]
*  period of time, it's two years after which the new constitution would be started. And actually, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  we're taking a lot of what we think positive lessons from the American political system, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2005.9199999999998s)]
*  trying to avoid what we think is not working here. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2013.92s)]
*  Yeah, I got some advice on that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2016.48s)]
*  Yeah, yes, yes. I several times worked in US political campaigns, even presidential campaigns. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2018.56s)]
*  So we were consciously learning what is working and what is not working. And now [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2025.76s)]
*  we are trying to implement those lessons there, but not to personally benefit, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2032.08s)]
*  but to make our country prosper and our children to be able to find their place in that society. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I like it. And it seems all very positive. But isn't it, you know, a bit of a fantasy? I mean, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2044.72s)]
*  how much support do you actually have? I mean, when you can sit down and write these plans, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2051.6s)]
*  very easy to write these plans and, you know, have these bull sessions at night and, you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2056.16s)]
*  talk about political ideas. But is the resistance in Russia significant at all? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2060.48s)]
*  No, you may consider me to be cynical. But the answer is that at this point, it doesn't matter. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2069.68s)]
*  Because there is a situation of war. If there was no war, we would need to build popular support, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2077.44s)]
*  and convince more people. But right now we will be coming to the situation when the statehood would [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2084.88s)]
*  be in ruins no matter what. We need to build something new. And we need to propose certain [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2092.32s)]
*  architecture to the people. And our way we want to design a new constitution is actually how it was [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2100.32s)]
*  done in Iceland with crowdsourcing approach by many people. And then it would be adopted on the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2108.88s)]
*  national referendum, which also would be the referendum for individual nations that currently [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2116.96s)]
*  live on the Russian territory when they can decide whether they want to stay or whether they want to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2123.28s)]
*  leave. Which is very important because the country needs to be constructed on non-imperialistic [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  voluntarily basis. And that's why we think that everybody would have the possibility to express [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2136.08s)]
*  their ideas during this transition period to design the new statehood so every single voice [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2145.12s)]
*  would be heard. What we want to do is just, yes, as people who are coming by force, essentially, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2153.44s)]
*  as a revolutionary force, we want to design this transition period exactly in the way to make [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2160.88s)]
*  everybody speak up. But you have a leader in Vladimir Putin who has effectively shut down [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2166.5600000000004s)]
*  all opposition media, controls the courts, the judiciary is entirely in the hands of the state, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2171.6800000000003s)]
*  invades countries, participates in the 500, 600,000 dead in Syria, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2179.92s)]
*  can poison people multiple times, can assassinate them in foreign countries, and no one does a [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2187.52s)]
*  thing. I mean, how do you dislodge a person like that when the international community shrugs [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2194.16s)]
*  their shoulders and says, you know, we can supply Ukraine with weapons, but even that comes up [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2199.12s)]
*  against resistance in most Western countries? You know, yes, there is a problem because many [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2203.9199999999996s)]
*  countries and first of all, as the United States, are very shy to support this Russian resistance. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2210.88s)]
*  They find gazillion different excuses why it shouldn't be done. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2220.48s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Yeah. The government is not going to be with you. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2223.84s)]
*  And, you know, we meet in private with a lot of different people, but not officially. And they [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2226.32s)]
*  are very much afraid of showing and expressing any public support. They like people who do like [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2233.6800000000003s)]
*  human rights things, you know, maybe a little bit of counter propaganda, but those who have [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2240.88s)]
*  real role in actual resisting and fighting for freedom, no, that's, you know, they prefer to [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2248.0s)]
*  keep out. And the regime is actually way more fragile than it actually looks. And if you saw [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2254.08s)]
*  the mutiny that was done by Evgeny Prigozhin, that's the illustration of my words. And all [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2261.92s)]
*  many people in Washington DC after that happened, I was saying this all the time that if you have [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2268.72s)]
*  5000 armed and trained people, you can actually go and capture Moscow and say, it's a fantasy, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2273.4399999999996s)]
*  you know, you're dreaming. And when they saw it, they actually called me and said, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  Ilja, looks like you have a proof of your concept, you know, it was working. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2284.16s)]
*  Soterios Lachance You're in the process of raising money and, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2287.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, troops and support for something like that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2290.64s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Yeah, exactly. That's my- [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2294.16s)]
*  Soterios Lachance That will operate in Ukraine or in Russia? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2295.9199999999996s)]
*  Soterios Lachance In Ukraine, that's what they do right now. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2298.3199999999997s)]
*  They are fighting. We already had several large scale military operations on the Russian territory. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2300.48s)]
*  Soterios Lachance And again, you know- [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2306.96s)]
*  Soterios Lachance And Belgrade and people- [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2309.44s)]
*  Soterios Lachance And Belgrade and Kursk and other stuff. What I'm also saying quite often, again, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2310.72s)]
*  the international community and the United States in particular prohibit Ukraine to use [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2316.7999999999997s)]
*  long range missiles on the Russian territory. So Russia can shoot on Ukraine, but Ukraine cannot [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2323.52s)]
*  reply. What Ukraine can reply with is drones. But for the drones to hit the target, you need to have [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2330.32s)]
*  actually foot on the ground, you know, you need to have locals who would do the navigation, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2339.6s)]
*  put the right coordinates, you know, and make sure that they hit the right target. Who is doing this? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2345.2s)]
*  It's Russians. It's our guys. It's our resistance people. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2350.56s)]
*  Soterios Lachance How big do you estimate your force within Russia is? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2354.64s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Approximately 10,000. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  Soterios Lachance At the moment. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2358.56s)]
*  Soterios Lachance 10,000. And that's 10,000 people that are active in [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2359.2s)]
*  what, you know, Facebook groups or VK groups or people that are actually doing- [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2364.88s)]
*  Soterios Lachance No, let's leave VK and Facebook groups for Alexei Navalny people. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2370.56s)]
*  Soterios Lachance We're doing something different. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2374.88s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2376.48s)]
*  Soterios Lachance We're involved in derailing the trains, in attacking refineries. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2376.88s)]
*  There was an attack on Kremlin's dome, you know, Russian airfields, you know, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2384.4s)]
*  this kind of things, many, many other stuff like- [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2391.1200000000003s)]
*  Soterios Lachance That attack on the Kremlin was your people? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2393.28s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Yes. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Not mine, but people who might know who are involved in this resistance. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2396.5600000000004s)]
*  Soterios Lachance In this greater universe. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2401.04s)]
*  Soterios Lachance Yes. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2402.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's say that. And that was mostly symbolic, right? We can hit you in the heart of the evil [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2403.04s)]
*  empire. Soterios Lachance [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2410.0s)]
*  Yeah. We wanted to show this and we wanted to stop them conducting military parades on the Red Square. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2410.4s)]
*  And after we did this, you know, there was just one T-34 tank of World War II, which they actually [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2417.6s)]
*  allowed themselves to put on the Red Square. Soterios Lachance [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2424.96s)]
*  What happens when your people within Russia are caught and arrested? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2427.2s)]
*  Soterios Lachance We have long prison terms, but we don't have many, fortunately. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2431.04s)]
*  But they are getting 25 plus years in prison. That's like current terms in Russia. We had [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2439.44s)]
*  several people who were shot. Soterios Lachance [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2448.16s)]
*  Just by the security forces? Soterios Lachance [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2451.92s)]
*  By the security forces during an attempted arrest. Right now, it's handful of people. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2453.2799999999997s)]
*  Soterios Lachance But again, as I said, the danger of being in a nonviolent protest is actually way [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2460.96s)]
*  higher than to be in the resistance. We have the list of political prisoners in Russia. They [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2469.52s)]
*  consider that it's only nonviolent people can be considered political prisoners. You know, we [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2479.04s)]
*  obviously say that everybody who was acting on the political motivation is by definition is a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2483.6s)]
*  political prisoner. But out of right now, 1500 political prisoners in Russia, only 150 were [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2490.08s)]
*  involved in the armed resistance and the rest are nonviolent. So it's just 10%. So it's way safer [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2498.24s)]
*  actually to do the real stuff. Soterios Lachance [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2505.92s)]
*  You hope to assassinate Vladimir Putin? Soterios Lachance [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2507.52s)]
*  I would prefer to see him in court. I would prefer to see him in The Hague. And I definitely [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2510.96s)]
*  would love to have an extended chat with him. But I'm very much afraid that he would not survive [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2517.84s)]
*  to that moment. I think that his inner circle would not allow Vladimir Putin to survive to the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2523.2000000000003s)]
*  fair trial. Soterios Lachance [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2531.28s)]
*  Ilya, thank you so much for joining us on Honestly. Soterios Lachance [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2532.48s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you as well. And it was my pleasure being here and for all our viewers and [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2535.76s)]
*  listeners. Help the Russian resistance. That's the way we can establish peace. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQYejsz_eI&t=2542.56s)]
