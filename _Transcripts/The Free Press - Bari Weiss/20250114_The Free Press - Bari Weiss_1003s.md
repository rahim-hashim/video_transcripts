Trump’s inauguration is right around the corner, and there is so much to cover about the new White House. In the coming weeks, we’ll have key figures in the Trump administration on Honestly to talk about what they are planning.

But, we all know that if Trump 2.0 is anything like Trump 1.0, there are going to be a lot of twists and turns here. And we want to analyze and break down each development that unfolds in Trump’s new administration.

Starting today and for the next few months, we’re going to bring you weekly episodes with two of my favorite guests: Batya Ungar-Sargon and Brianna Wu.

Batya Ungar-Sargon is a Free Press contributor and the opinion editor at Newsweek. Brianna Wu is a Democratic fundraiser and activist, and in her past life, a video game developer. If you’ve heard them together on Honestly before, you know that these two come from different sides of the political spectrum, but we really value hearing both of their perspectives, even—or especially—when they disagree. We think you will too.

Today, we’re going to cover the LA fires and their political implications, the civil war inside the MAGA movement between the nationalist populists and the free marketers over H-1B visas, and Mark Zuckerberg’s red-pill moment and changes at Meta—and the pair give us their predictions for confirmation hearings beginning this week.

# Who Is Responsible for the Devastation in California?
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow)
*  Batya and Brianna, welcome to Honestly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=3.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=4.72s)]
*  This is such an honor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=5.72s)]
*  I'm so excited to get to know Batya better in YouTube area. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=6.72s)]
*  This is going to be great. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=9.28s)]
*  Okay, brunettes, let's try, let's dive in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=11.28s)]
*  Before we get to the incoming administration, we need to cover a story that I really didn't [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=14.92s)]
*  expect us to be covering, although maybe, you know, the people that pay close attention [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  to nature and reign and incompetency in California governance would not be so surprised. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=23.54s)]
*  And of course, I'm talking here about the California fires, since that is the thing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=30.5s)]
*  on mine and I'm sure yours and everyone's mind. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=34.3s)]
*  These are the most destructive fires in Los Angeles's history. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=37.5s)]
*  As we record, 24 people have died. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=41.82s)]
*  That number is sure to go up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=44.14s)]
*  More than 12,000 homes, businesses and buildings have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=46.22s)]
*  There are whole parts of Los Angeles that seem like a nuclear bomb has been set off. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=51.22s)]
*  And lots of people are pointing lots of fingers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=56.58s)]
*  And I wanted to start by just asking, who's to blame here? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=59.66s)]
*  And Batya, I thought maybe we could start with you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=62.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're seeing, you know, people on the left kind of blaming the climate change issue [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=65.46s)]
*  and people on the right blaming, you know, DEI or incompetence. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=70.5s)]
*  I feel pretty grossed out by both of these trends. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=75.66s)]
*  I think Leighton Woodhouse really nailed it in a piece he wrote for Newsweek and also [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=79.34s)]
*  in the Free Press, where he argued that there's just something about the geology of this place [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=84.62s)]
*  that lends itself to these horrific acts of God every half a century, that the land there, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=92.64s)]
*  you know, around the Santa Monica Beach, Pacific Palisades should never have been developed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=100.5s)]
*  because it was always going to erupt in flames in this way due to, you know, the fact that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  the vegetation grows really lush during the rainy winter months and then dries out and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=111.26s)]
*  the Santa Ana winds show up in the dry summer months. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  And so to me, I found that really compelling. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  I just think it is so hard to imagine, you know, somebody doing a better job with so [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=124.34s)]
*  much destruction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't have any confidence in Karen Bass or in Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=132.34s)]
*  I don't think that they're stars or particularly competent people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=135.58s)]
*  But at the same time, nobody's pointing to things that are legitimate as, you know, actual [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  mistakes that would have actually prevented this or helped the situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=143.5s)]
*  From what I've been able to gather and, you know, your listeners should tell me if I'm [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=149.06s)]
*  wrong about this, but it seems like the reason there was no water in the hydrants was not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=152.38s)]
*  because there is an absence of water for this kind of thing, but because the water pressure [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=157.06s)]
*  was simply failed because they were trying to get all of the water in the city into one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  place, which is something that is very predictable, but I don't know how you fix for it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=166.94s)]
*  So to me, I feel like the politicization of this has been extremely disappointing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=171.54s)]
*  But I do think that on the ground, there's been a lot of unity and a lot of coming together, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=176.9s)]
*  a lot of really moving moments on social media. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=180.98s)]
*  So I'm trying to focus on those. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=183.54s)]
*  I'll say here that the piece that you referenced by Leighton Woodhouse has elicited more anger [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=185.1s)]
*  from very thoughtful people than perhaps any story we've run in the past few months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=192.38s)]
*  I want to just read part of a letter that we're going to run tomorrow because I think [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  it'll take us a little deeper into this conversation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=200.14s)]
*  Leighton Woodhouse's piece is a revolting example of the defeatism that permeates far [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=202.7s)]
*  too much of civil society today. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=207.1s)]
*  It's the same philosophy animating low birth rates, climate inevitability, and racial determinism. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  Taken to its logical conclusion, Woodhouse's argument is that because Earth is part of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=214.5s)]
*  a solar system that faces black holes, asteroids, and an eventual implosion on the sun, we should [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=219.62s)]
*  merely hang our heads and mutter goodbye to our lineage as the natural process of destruction [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=225.46s)]
*  takes place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=230.66s)]
*  In other words, there's a kind of determinism and defeatism in the argument that, well, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=231.66s)]
*  Los Angeles is built to burn. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=236.66s)]
*  In other words, you could say the same thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=238.62s)]
*  Manhattan is built to flood. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  We're surrounded by water. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=241.5s)]
*  The entire idea of building cities and civilization is the idea that we push back against nature. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=242.94s)]
*  So maybe I'm getting too heady for before noon on a Monday, but I got to say having [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=250.58s)]
*  lived in LA over the past four years, having seen the way that the basic compact between [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  citizens and the government does not work. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=264.3s)]
*  You cannot, if you call the LAPD because there you see a robbery or in my case, see a man [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=267.98s)]
*  wildly swinging a machete, it might take them an hour to show up. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=272.94s)]
*  Living in New York, New York feels like this utopian paradise in terms of just functionality [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  compared to Los Angeles. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=283.06s)]
*  So those fires are taking place in that political context, one in which things that should be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=284.18s)]
*  public are increasingly privatized and in which people have really lost faith in the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=290.26s)]
*  mayor and in the governor. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  But I've gone on too long. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=296.44s)]
*  I'm meant to be the host. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=297.44s)]
*  Brianna, what do you think? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=298.44s)]
*  Who's to blame? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  I think it's so interesting because I think, Vatia, you're being a little bit more generous [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  than the Democrats than I would be. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=305.98s)]
*  And this is what I would say. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  When I ran for Congress here in Massachusetts, I got a front row seat to what happens with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=310.5s)]
*  one party governance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=315.86s)]
*  And I think this is, it really opened my eyes for a lot of things because Massachusetts, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=318.26s)]
*  I think, is a great place to live. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  But when it comes to some of our congenital problems that we just don't seem able to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=325.66s)]
*  solve like housing or public transportation, the problem is the political system because [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=329.38s)]
*  Democrats are the only ones that win functionally. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=335.84s)]
*  It's all set up to reward field to power. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think LA is this problem on steroids as well as I can, as best as I can tell. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=343.32s)]
*  I actually flew out of LA the day that the fire started. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=348.52s)]
*  I was out there and before it, I had a tweet that went viral just talking about how difficult [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=353.44s)]
*  it was to see the city degrade over the last 15 years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  I've been visiting there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  Homelessness is through the roof. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=365.08s)]
*  I saw people shooting up drugs on the street. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  It was really, really surprising to me. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=369.44s)]
*  So I think you're dead on that I agree with the free press piece when you're saying the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  core problem is ecological. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  But that piece also tells stories about people not getting alerts on their phone when we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=380.0s)]
*  get an alert every time a senior citizen goes missing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=385.84s)]
*  No matter what, I think there is a crisis of confidence in our elected leaders and the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=389.84s)]
*  trust has been broken that they're on our side. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=396.8s)]
*  And I think that goes for Democrats particularly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about the political implications of this, not politicizing the fires themselves, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=403.4s)]
*  but the implications. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=407.8s)]
*  Trump tweeted, one of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America, and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  I can attest to that, it's really paradise, is burning down to the ground. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=413.8s)]
*  It's ashes and Gavin Newsom should resign. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=417.56s)]
*  This is all his fault. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=421.48s)]
*  Two weeks from now, Karen Bass, will she be in or out? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=424.4s)]
*  Gavin Newsom? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=427.52s)]
*  What's his fate? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=428.52s)]
*  He's long wanted to run for the presidency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=429.68s)]
*  Are those dreams over because of this fire? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=432.64s)]
*  That was my first thought, is this is the end of his political career? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=436.28s)]
*  I don't see how he survives this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=439.68s)]
*  And that sounds like a contradiction with what I open with, but I don't think it is. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=441.68s)]
*  It could be that something is just so devastating that your inability to respond to it in a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=444.8s)]
*  way that's compelling ends your political career, even though there would have been [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=450.04s)]
*  very little you could have done. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, if Governor DeSantis had been in charge of L.A., I think people would have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=455.32s)]
*  felt like there was more competence going on around them, because I agree, of course, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=460.56s)]
*  with both of you, that the contract in California has been broken and that there's a huge crisis [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  in trust in public institutions. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=469.32s)]
*  I just think that this was an act of God and was so devastating for these ecological reasons [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  that it seems sort of almost unfair. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, the Karen Bass being in Ghana, that was an unforced error that led to this perception [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=480.92s)]
*  that the people in charge were not worthy of the trust of the public. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=487.72s)]
*  And they have earned that in a million different ways. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=491.92s)]
*  I just don't think that I certainly, through all of my research, have not been able to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  come up with a better plan for how they could have handled this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=499.92s)]
*  But it may sink their careers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=503.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that that's very likely. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=505.6s)]
*  Here's one of the lessons I'll put my cards on the table that I draw from this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=507.8s)]
*  Government in L.A. and in many blue cities across the country has lost sight of the most [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=512.84s)]
*  basic parts of their job, which is keeping people safe. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=517.44s)]
*  Safe from crime, safe from, you know, majorly drug addicted people harassing them on the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=521.48s)]
*  street, safe in this case from natural disasters like wildfires, or if not safe, at least prepared. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=526.72s)]
*  And instead, they have focused on, you know, what Rob Henderson might call luxury issues [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  or niche boutique issues that have very little to do with the basics of governing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=539.12s)]
*  Is that going to be one of the kind of political takeaways from this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=544.4s)]
*  I want to say something really quickly because I really want to hear what Brianna has to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=547.36s)]
*  say about that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=549.36s)]
*  Twenty people have died, I believe. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=552.52s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  Twenty-four so far, but it's definitely going to go up. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=555.12s)]
*  Twenty-four people so far have died and we mourn every single one of them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  Horrific tragedy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  Most of them were seniors and disabled people who couldn't get out. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=565.12s)]
*  When you look at the scope of the damage, people were informed. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=566.36s)]
*  People got out. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=573.16s)]
*  I mean, if you had asked me looking at that landscape, that post-apocalyptic burnt out [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=574.16s)]
*  landscape, how many people I would have thought would have died? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=580.56s)]
*  And again, God forbid I'm not minimizing these horrific deaths. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  I would have expected it to be in the hundreds, if not the thousands. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=588.04s)]
*  So I do think that there's a point of view. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=592.76s)]
*  And we're talking about, I mean, you think about the neighborhoods like the Pacific Palaces. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=594.8s)]
*  I mean, I've been reading a lot about this. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=597.8s)]
*  A lot of these towns are built. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=599.4s)]
*  There's one road going into an area where 2,500 people live. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=601.44s)]
*  The cars, they had to flee their cars and survived fleeing their cars because the trees [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=605.72s)]
*  on either side of the road were engulfed in flames. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=611.76s)]
*  So really miraculous survival of many, many people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=614.88s)]
*  And again, God forbid not to undermine the deaths, but it does seem like people's lives [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=619.36s)]
*  were very much saved. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=625.1600000000001s)]
*  There was a lot of property damage. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=626.24s)]
*  And of course, that's terrible. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=628.0s)]
*  But I just wanted to make that point. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=629.64s)]
*  So where does your calculation come in that Gavin Newsom is going to have long-term damage [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=632.44s)]
*  because I think if we've seen anything over political history, I think all of us have [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=637.72s)]
*  learned that the American people tend to have short memories, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  So how do you get from A to B? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=646.72s)]
*  How do you think this is going to... [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  And look, cards on the table. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=650.72s)]
*  I'm friends with multiple people that I'm sure are going to run for president in 2028. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  We've had a lot of conversations about Gavin Newsom and the risk, what his vulnerabilities [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=658.36s)]
*  are. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=663.44s)]
*  And I do think that there's an opening here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  And I'm curious, from your perspective, how do you get from A to B? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=666.6s)]
*  We're in 2028 after four years of Trump. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=670.0s)]
*  He's not going to be competitive when he's one of the very best communicators that we [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=672.96s)]
*  have. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=676.36s)]
*  Because I think a lot of the donor base that would have supported him are now homeless. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=677.96s)]
*  You can either really upset the middle class of the Democratic Party, or you can upset [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=684.4s)]
*  the rich donor class. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=691.28s)]
*  And I think a lot of the people who would have been that support against the bulwark [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=693.0s)]
*  of the sort of middle class and working class neighborhoods that went up in flame are now [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=698.48s)]
*  homeless and uninsured for their 20, $30 million homes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  And I don't think that they are going to forgive him for this, even if it's not necessarily [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=705.96s)]
*  his fault, especially when you're going to have such a crowded field of so many people [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=710.24s)]
*  who are not associated with being on TV at the time that their homes were burning. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=713.6s)]
*  I could also make the argument, though, from the, you know, sure, there's the wealthy donor [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  class perspective on it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=723.0s)]
*  But there's also, you know, all to Dina, this is not Malibu. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=724.2s)]
*  This is not the palisades. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Like these are middle, like solidly middle class people. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=729.32s)]
*  And if I'm them, and if I if my home is just burned to the ground. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=733.96s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, I'm thinking about this guy who went to the French laundry or whatever [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=737.2s)]
*  it was in the middle of COVID. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  Someone can fact check me on that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=742.82s)]
*  But I think memory serves. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=743.82s)]
*  That was right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=744.82s)]
*  Yeah, like, why am I voting for the person that is so out of touch with with my everyday [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=745.98s)]
*  concerns? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=752.5400000000001s)]
*  Just as an example, though, of like I've sort of been there's been a lot that we've published [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=753.5400000000001s)]
*  in a lot of commentary, I think, over the past since since the election November on [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=758.2600000000001s)]
*  the vibe shift, right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=763.2600000000001s)]
*  Culturally and politically and, you know, the the woke is fading. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=765.2600000000001s)]
*  People are moving to the right. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=770.98s)]
*  You guys know this conversation. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=771.98s)]
*  One piece of evidence just of how quickly things can shift is Maria Shriver, hardly [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=774.26s)]
*  a Republican conservative, is on Twitter talking about how Los Angeles and California needs [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  radical change in the wake of this. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  I have friends in L.A. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=789.66s)]
*  Progressives texting me. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=791.46s)]
*  I guess I'm a Republican now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=793.14s)]
*  In other words, they are so fed up that it's not that they're Republican on on any particular [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=794.86s)]
*  policy issue. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=801.1s)]
*  It's that they are so disgusted, Brianna, with, you know, one party rule and the corruption [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=802.1s)]
*  of it that they're just like done. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=808.14s)]
*  I'll vote for anything else. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=810.02s)]
*  That's not this. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=811.38s)]
*  Do you see that happening? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=812.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think that really brings me into I hope as we do this, like this is a point I [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=813.38s)]
*  really want to hammer. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=819.22s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=820.98s)]
*  Like we all remember why to K. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=821.98s)]
*  Why to K was a problem with technical debt. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=823.5s)]
*  We made some decisions in the 80s and 90s and we had to pay for it when the millennium [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=826.2199999999999s)]
*  came because our computers were going to crash. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=832.3s)]
*  There's a term for this is called technical debt. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=834.54s)]
*  The Democratic Party has serious silliness debt built up and the silliness debt is focusing [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=837.62s)]
*  even for me as a trans woman on trans policy and pronouns and a whole bunch of like there [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=846.06s)]
*  was a clip that went viral with someone like, you know, doing sign language in front of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=852.66s)]
*  a press conference from this, even though teleprompters are built in. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=857.3s)]
*  We focus so much on these superficial, silly issues that do not make working class people's [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=861.06s)]
*  lives better. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=868.06s)]
*  And this is what Bateh, you've focused on like laser in your analysis. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=869.06s)]
*  Is dad right about that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=872.5s)]
*  So Barry, this is my analysis. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=874.26s)]
*  When Trump won, it was really heartened because the conversations I was having with Democratic [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=877.24s)]
*  insiders were very much how do we get back in touch with working class people? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=882.7s)]
*  How do we put some of these silly issues aside? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=887.82s)]
*  How do we get back to basics again? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=890.66s)]
*  And what is really terrifying me is today as we're recording this, I'm already seeing [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=893.18s)]
*  it just get back to the same playbook, which is anti Trump, deny everything, just point [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=898.5s)]
*  out that he's bad. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=903.82s)]
*  This is a losing playbook for us. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=905.34s)]
*  So I think how can this be? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=907.86s)]
*  How can how can this possibly? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=909.98s)]
*  I'm sure there's a way. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=911.78s)]
*  How can this possibly be yoked to Trump? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=912.78s)]
*  This? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=915.74s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=916.34s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=917.22s)]
*  But what I'm saying is like, look at what happened with Gavin Newsom, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LJmr2H9iow&t=918.54s)]
