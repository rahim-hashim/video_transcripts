At the center of the ongoing debate surrounding AI and its future are two men, Sam Altman and Elon Musk. And if you haven’t been following, they aren’t exactly in alignment.

They started off as friends and business partners. In fact, Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015. But over the years, Musk grew increasingly frustrated with OpenAI until he finally resigned from the board in 2018. That feud escalated this past year when Musk sued Altman and OpenAI on multiple occasions to try to prevent the company from launching a for-profit arm of the business, a structure that Musk claims is never supposed to happen in OpenAI. He also argues that changing its structure in this way might even be “illegal.”

On the one hand, this is a very complex disagreement. To understand every single detail of it, you probably need a law degree and special expertise in American tax law. But you don’t need a degree or specialization to understand that, at its heart, this feud is about something much bigger and more existential than the business model of OpenAI, although that’s extremely important.

This is really a fight over who will ultimately be in control of a technology that some say, if used incorrectly, could very well make human beings obsolete.

Here to tell his side of the story today is Sam Altman.

# Sam Altman on His Feud With Elon Musk
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU)
*  One of the reasons we wanted to have this conversation with you today is not just because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=0.0s)]
*  we want to hear about the ways that AI is going to transform the way that we live and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=4.5s)]
*  work, but because you're in a very public battle right now with your original open AI [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=9.44s)]
*  co-founder, Elon Musk. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=14.5s)]
*  And I think it's safe to say that most listeners of this show will like vaguely know that there's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=16.84s)]
*  a conflict between Elon Musk having to do with this one of his companies, one of his [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=21.64s)]
*  many companies, but they're certainly not following the nitty gritty details of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=27.86s)]
*  various lawsuits and of the conflict more generally. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=31.98s)]
*  So I want to try and summarize it for you in the most fair way that I can, and then [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=34.88s)]
*  you'll tell me if I've gotten it wrong or where I've overstepped. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=39.82s)]
*  So open AI begins in 2015 and it starts as a nonprofit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=43.78s)]
*  And in a blog post introducing open AI to the world in December of that year, you wrote [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  Open AI is a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=54.62s)]
*  Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=58.62s)]
*  humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=62.72s)]
*  Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  human impact. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=72.2s)]
*  And this was a huge aspect of the brand. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=73.2s)]
*  Then fast forward four years in 2019, open AI moves to what it called a hybrid model [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  with a for-profit arm that got a billion dollar investment from Microsoft in that year. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=82.18s)]
*  Since then, Microsoft has poured something like 13 billion dollars, it might be a higher [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=87.66s)]
*  number, more into the company. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=92.14s)]
*  And Elon was one of the co-founders, as I mentioned, since the beginning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=94.94s)]
*  But his relationship with the company soured over time because he disagreed with the shift [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  that I just described, the shift from this nonprofit model to a hybrid model. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  And he eventually leaves the company and steps down from the board. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=109.08s)]
*  And that takes us to this year, in which Elon has sued you and open AI on several different [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  occasions so far this year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=118.52s)]
*  And he has given many interviews and posted countless amount of tweets or Xs or whatever [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=120.72s)]
*  we're supposed to call them about this conflict. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=125.92s)]
*  All of the lawsuits claim that you were in some kind of contract violation by putting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=129.12s)]
*  profits ahead of the public good in the move to advance AI. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=134.5s)]
*  And then last month, and this is the most recent development, Elon asked the district [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=139.1s)]
*  judge in California to block open AI from converting to this for-profit structure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=143.7s)]
*  Okay, that was a mouthful. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=149.74s)]
*  Did I summarize it properly? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=151.86s)]
*  And is there anything crucial that I left out? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=153.66s)]
*  You must summarize it properly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=155.78s)]
*  But I mean, it was Elon that most wanted to convert. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=157.74s)]
*  It was Elon that most wanted open AI to be a for-profit at one point and had made a bunch [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=162.22s)]
*  of proposals that would have also things like open AI being part of Tesla, but mostly just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=166.94s)]
*  create a new for-profit that he was going to be in control of. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  So other than that, I think a lot of the summary there is correct. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  I have a bunch of thoughts and opinions on it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=180.46s)]
*  But as a statement of facts, that was otherwise mostly correct. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=182.62s)]
*  Give us like the 10,000 foot version. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=186.1s)]
*  What is the fundamental conflict between Elon Musk and his various allies, Meta being [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=188.74s)]
*  one of them, and you guys? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=195.62s)]
*  What is the disagreement fundamentally about? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=197.58s)]
*  Look, I don't live inside Elon's head, so this is a little bit of speculation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  Elon definitely did a lot to help open AI in the early days. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=207.94s)]
*  And in spite of all of this, I'm very grateful. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=210.62s)]
*  And I think he's just a sort of legendary entrepreneur. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=212.5s)]
*  He's also clearly a bully, and he's also someone who clearly likes to get in fights. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=217.1s)]
*  Right now it's me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=221.1s)]
*  It's been Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, lots of other people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=222.22s)]
*  And I think fundamentally, this is about open AI is doing really well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  Elon cares about doing really well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=232.14s)]
*  Elon started and now runs a very direct competitor that's trying to do exactly what open AI does. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=234.66s)]
*  And I'll point out is a structure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=244.74s)]
*  You know, it's like a public benefit corp. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=248.78s)]
*  And I heard Elon has majority ownership and control and seems like a reasonable thing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=250.34s)]
*  he would do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=254.78s)]
*  I think a lot of the press has been misreported. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=255.78s)]
*  Even if we go through with some of the, any of the conversion ideas or evolution ideas [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=260.14s)]
*  we're talking about, it's like the nonprofit goes away. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=265.72s)]
*  The nonprofit doesn't like stop being a nonprofit and becomes a for-profit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=268.06s)]
*  We've talked publicly about maybe we evolve our current LLC into a PBC, but anything we [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=271.46s)]
*  do would strengthen the nonprofit. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=277.18s)]
*  The nonprofit would continue to exist, would continue to serve, hopefully better serve [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  the same purpose. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=283.38s)]
*  And the overall mission of the company that you talked about, which is develop this incredible [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=285.02s)]
*  technology, do it in a way that we think is maximally beneficial to humans and get it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=289.02s)]
*  out into the world for people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=293.5s)]
*  We keep doing that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm incredibly proud of our track record on doing that so far. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  People, as you were saying earlier, use Chad GPT and love it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=299.82s)]
*  There's an incredible free tier of Chad GPT. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=302.34s)]
*  We lose money on it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=305.26s)]
*  It's not ad support or anything. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=306.26s)]
*  We just want to put AI in people's hands. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=307.26s)]
*  We continue to want to deploy this technology so that people co-evolve with it, understand [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=309.14s)]
*  it, that the world is going through this process it's going through right now of contending [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=314.98s)]
*  with AI and eventually AGI and thinking how it's going to go. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  And everything we're doing, I believe Elon would be happy about if he were in control [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=322.14s)]
*  of the company. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=326.5s)]
*  He left when he thought we were on a trajectory to certainly fail and also wouldn't do something [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=327.66s)]
*  where he had total control over OpenAI. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  But I think it's a little bit of a sideshow and the right thing for us to do is just keep [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=335.82000000000005s)]
*  doing incredible research, keep shipping products people love, and most importantly, keep pursuing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  this mission of AGI to benefit people and getting that out into the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=345.62s)]
*  For someone who's just tuning into this topic, why is it important, Sam, that OpenAI has [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=349.86s)]
*  a for-profit arm or converts in the way that you've been talking about? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=356.94s)]
*  Why is that essential to your growth? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  When we started OpenAI, we thought it's hard to go back and remember how different things [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=363.14s)]
*  were in 2015. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=368.66s)]
*  That was before language models and chatbots. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=371.34s)]
*  It was way before chat GPT. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=373.1s)]
*  We were doing research and publishing papers and working on AIs that could play video games [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=374.46s)]
*  and control robotic hands and things like that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=378.3s)]
*  And we were supposed to get a billion dollars but ended up not. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=381.18s)]
*  We thought with a billion dollars we could make substantial progress towards what we [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=384.88s)]
*  were trying to do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=388.44s)]
*  As we learned more and got into the scaling language model world, we realized that it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=389.58s)]
*  was not going to cost one billion or even 10, but like 100 billion plus, and we couldn't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=393.64s)]
*  do that as a nonprofit. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=398.56s)]
*  So that was the fundamental reason for it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=400.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=402.8s)]
*  So like it's maybe another way to say it is like it's absolutely essential for the computational [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=403.8s)]
*  power to create. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=408.52s)]
*  And every other effort pursuing AI has realized this and is set up in some way where they [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=411.08s)]
*  can sort of access capital markets. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=414.64s)]
*  You've said a lot of different things about Elon in recent days. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=416.84s)]
*  You gave this interview at Dealbook where Andrew Ross Sorkin is sort of asking you how [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=419.2s)]
*  you feel about the conflict and you say, sad. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  And you also say that you think Elon's companies are awesome. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=425.84s)]
*  And then he asked you, you know, do you think he's going to use his newfound political influence [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  to kind of punish you or punish open AI or punish his competitors? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=433.88s)]
*  And you said in that interview that you thought he would do the right thing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=439.2s)]
*  How do you square that with what you just told me, which is that Elon's a bully? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=442.32s)]
*  Bullies don't typically do the right thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=445.84s)]
*  I think they can totally be. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=447.44s)]
*  Like I think there are people who will really be a jerk on Twitter who will still not like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=449.52s)]
*  abuse the system of a country they're now in a sort of extremely influential political [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=455.4s)]
*  role for. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=460.88s)]
*  That seems completely different to me. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=462.84s)]
*  Until now, much of this battle, you know, for those of us who are like perpetually online [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=465.68s)]
*  perpetually on Twitter, we have been following the conflict via like tweets, lobbed sub tweets. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=470.16s)]
*  It's all sort of been playing out in real time on Twitter for us to watch. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=476.0s)]
*  Open AI, though, has sort of been in like response mode sometimes or mostly kind of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=480.56s)]
*  ignoring everything. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=485.24s)]
*  That's sort of how I'd characterize it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=486.8s)]
*  That changed a few days ago when you guys published this very, very long memo on open. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=488.5s)]
*  It's like a blog post on Open AI's website. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=494.8s)]
*  People should go and read it again. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=497.0s)]
*  People put in the show notes and it's sort of like complete. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=498.08s)]
*  It's like a timeline going back to 2015, proving from your perspective that, you know, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=501.44s)]
*  via emails and screenshots of texts and explanations of those screenshots and those texts that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=507.88s)]
*  Elon wanted open AI to or Elon rather was open to open AI being a for profit going all [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=515.84s)]
*  the way back then. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=524.04s)]
*  I read all 29 pages for those who don't want to do that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=525.24s)]
*  They could go to chat, GPT and ask them to summer asked chat to summarize it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  Here's how chat. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  GPT summarized it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  This article details the rift between Elon Musk and open eyes leadership, particularly [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=535.52s)]
*  Sam Altman stemming from Musk's dissatisfaction with open a shift from a nonprofit to a hybrid [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=540.28s)]
*  for profit model. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=546.28s)]
*  This feud is crucial, Chatt told me, because it underscores the broader ethical dilemma [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  of how I should be developed and controlled, whether it should prioritize public good or [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=551.88s)]
*  corporate profit, especially as powerful AI technologies become increasingly influential [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=556.32s)]
*  in society in the economy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=561.4s)]
*  I thought that was pretty good. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=563.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=564.76s)]
*  No, but on your general point, you are right that we do not sit there and like throw tomatoes [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=565.88s)]
*  back and forth on Twitter. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=570.12s)]
*  The reason for this one was we had to make a legal filing and we wanted to provide some [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=572.0s)]
*  context. We've published about this once before. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=576.0s)]
*  Also, we had to make a legal filing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=578.36s)]
*  I've lost track of how many times that Elon has sued us. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=580.2s)]
*  I think it's like four, you know, withdraws changes, goes for this preliminary injunction, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=583.6s)]
*  whatever. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=588.6s)]
*  Our job is to build a GI in a way that benefits humanity and figure out how to safely and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=589.6s)]
*  broadly distribute it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=595.48s)]
*  Our job is not to engage in like a Twitter fight with Elon. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=597.36s)]
*  But when we have to respond to a legal filing, we will. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=604.04s)]
*  We will. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=606.96s)]
*  And sometimes we'll provide context. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=607.96s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed that clip from my conversation with OpenAI's Sam Altman. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=610.96s)]
*  For my money, it's one of the most fascinating episodes we recorded in 2024. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDD2KAzuBU&t=615.44s)]
