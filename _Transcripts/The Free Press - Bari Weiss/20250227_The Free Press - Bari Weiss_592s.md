Brian Armstrong is a 42-year-old San Jose native who changed the nature of commerce not only in America but all over the world. He co-founded a cryptocurrency platform called Coinbase in 2012. Now, it’s the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.

Today on Honestly, he explains why he is “inspired” by the work being done by DOGE, and thinks it may be the beginning of reclaiming economic freedom in America.

# “DOGE Is Restoring Freedom to America” | Brian Armstrong
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk)
*  Doge has uncovered a lot of insane things over the past three weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=0.0s)]
*  It's felt like more like three years since Trump came to office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=5.32s)]
*  But, you know, there's been like trans operas in Siberia and DEI initiatives in Kazakhstan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=8.4s)]
*  But I don't think there's anything that's going to stick with me more than this image of a limestone mine in Pennsylvania, where 230 feet under the ground in a cave, 700 workers process [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  federal employee retirements using paper by hand, which are then stored in Manila envelopes and cardboard boxes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=29.52s)]
*  And there is this incredible Washington Post article from 10 years ago about how it's basically a limestone cave version of the office and how all these people hate each other. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=37.36s)]
*  And one thing I've just been thinking about a lot over the past few weeks is this sort of split screen reality that we have in American life right now, which is Washington on one side, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=47.4s)]
*  typified by this limestone underground mine processing things on paper by hand. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=58.68s)]
*  And then this other world, which is the world of the private sector, most notably the private sector in Silicon Valley, that is light speed, AI, crypto, blockchain, blood boys, rockets into outer space, the future. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=64.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=79.08s)]
*  And these are the two largest employers in America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=79.56s)]
*  And now they have met inside this new MAGA Trump coalition in Washington. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to start by asking you if you think this merger marriage is working and what you think of this sort of strange split screen reality coming into coming into one frame. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=104.28s)]
*  Well, I'm incredibly excited about Doge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=104.52s)]
*  I mean, my whole personal philosophy is I'm pro freedom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=106.28s)]
*  That's economic freedom, which is the mission of Coinbase. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=110.44s)]
*  But freedom of speech, you know, up and down the board, I'm pro freedom. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=113.0s)]
*  I think that's what creates civilizational progress. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=116.28s)]
*  And so one big way you can get economic freedom is by having a smaller, more efficient government. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=118.64s)]
*  So I am a huge supporter of Doge. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=124.64s)]
*  I think it's probably the most inspiring thing I've seen in government in my lifetime. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=126.52s)]
*  And it's kind of what you touched on, which is that the government, I think the government should be really limited to setting policy, you know, a few core functions like having courts and a military. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=130.72s)]
*  But they're not good at building things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=143.24s)]
*  You don't want to have the government actually building fighter jets. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=143.52s)]
*  You outsource that to the private industry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=147.12s)]
*  And I think we don't go far enough with that in our society. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  And over time, if you look at the last couple hundred years of the United States, it's the size of government measured by percentage GDP going to government has gotten bigger and bigger. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=153.24s)]
*  And now they're kind of running larger and larger areas of the economy, you know, whether it's education or health care, these banking, these things are all kind of like quasi government. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=161.68s)]
*  And so the U.S. is a pretty free country, but you can think of it as a spectrum between like 100 percent run by the government and 100 percent run by the private sector. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=169.72s)]
*  Percentage of GDP going to government and in the form of taxes is kind of a way to estimate what percent socialist or communist are we right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=178.2s)]
*  And it's been trending up over the last 100 or 200 years. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  I think that we need to cut that dramatically back. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  And the private industry is just far more effective at building things and running things. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=191.48s)]
*  And we're seeing like if they if they go into this, the government, like you're seeing here, the amount of waste and corruption and fraud is and just incompetence is staggering to anybody who's worked in the private sector. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=195.04s)]
*  Do you think that America was freer 100 years ago than it is today? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=206.88s)]
*  Yeah, I do think so. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=210.28s)]
*  You know, the founding. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not an expert on this, but I've tried to go read a little bit of the federalist papers and all these kind of things. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=213.96s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, if you go back, I'd say like around 1900, I think, you know, total revenue going to the government was maybe like 10 percent of GDP. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=218.4s)]
*  And today it's probably, I don't know, three x that at least maybe three to four x that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=227.72s)]
*  And so we have been trending to a society that has more and more functions run by the government and they're just less efficient. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=233.68s)]
*  You know, the Department of Education, for instance, it's like the test scores didn't go up and it's incredibly expensive. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=241.84s)]
*  Right. And so how do you create excellence? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=247.84s)]
*  It's it's by competition. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=250.84s)]
*  You want to have a free market of ideas where people are choosing where to send their children or where to spend their hard earned dollars. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=252.56s)]
*  And competition creates that excellence to say, like, well, if there's a better product at a better price or something that I think will teach my children better, I want to have the choice to put it there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=260.68s)]
*  That's what's creating excellence. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=269.36s)]
*  It's accountability through competition. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=270.48s)]
*  The government is a monopoly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=272.68s)]
*  You know, we get the worst customer service from monopolies. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=274.48s)]
*  Why would it be any different in government? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=277.64s)]
*  I think some people who are watching what Doge is doing right now in Washington are like their minds are blown. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=279.56s)]
*  It seems absolutely insane. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=285.44s)]
*  It seems revolutionary, but you can make an argument that actually what they're doing is just trying to chip away and trying to return government to what had been its rightful place. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=286.6s)]
*  I think that's right. If you're a regulator in the executive branch and the law is unclear, you don't just get to make up your own laws. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=297.56s)]
*  That's not what the Constitution says. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  The Constitution says Congress shall make the laws. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=305.08s)]
*  The regulators need to go enforce the laws that exist. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=307.8s)]
*  They don't get to create new laws. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=309.92s)]
*  And that's a good example of what we're seeing now as a transition where all of these agencies that got created and a lot of the regulations were actually unconstitutional and they need to get dramatically paired back. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  Peter Thiel once said that people in D.C. are completely backwards. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  They don't understand any of the technology. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=326.88s)]
*  And even to the extent that they can, it can't be stopped. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=329.44s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Directionally, he's right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=333.84s)]
*  Yes, I do think there's very few people in D.C. who understand technology. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=334.84s)]
*  That's a pretty uncontroversial statement. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=339.12s)]
*  And I think even when they do try to create a barrier to it, like we saw some of these A.I. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  executive order came out of the Biden administration, which in my view was a mistake. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=350.32s)]
*  It really said, hey, you can't have more than this number of parameters in a model, which is just like, you know, anybody who knows anything about technology knows that Moore's law. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=354.56s)]
*  Right. It's like every 18 months, the thing gets faster, cheaper, more capable. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=363.96s)]
*  And so they were just kind of it showed that they didn't understand how technology worked. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think that with the release of these open source models and then countries like China putting out these models, that's a great example of where they didn't have the ability to really control it, even if they wanted to. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=372.68s)]
*  This debate goes back to even encryption in the early days, right, where encrypted messaging apps are now kind of like ho hum, you know, kind of boring everyday stuff. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=384.96s)]
*  But like signal, like you're talking about things like signal. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=394.08s)]
*  Yeah, signal WhatsApp, even iMessage is encrypted now where when they subpoena Apple, they don't I don't think they have the ability to get it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=396.76s)]
*  There's always some debate about, you know, does the NSA have some secret backdoor? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=404.84s)]
*  But as a broad, you know, encryption first came out, people were kind of afraid, oh, this is all going to be used by terrorists and everything like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=408.2s)]
*  And so it's usually it's usually something like protecting the children or terrorism is the fear mongering piece of it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=415.32s)]
*  But, you know, encryption is a powerful technology that just it got out there. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=422.2s)]
*  Governments, I don't think, had fully the ability to control it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is good. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=428.68s)]
*  I mean, I hate I hate to say it in some ways, but we wouldn't have this level of progress in society if everything that government wanted to do actually stopped it in its tracks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=429.32s)]
*  Innovation keeps moving forward and that's very important for civilizational progress. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=439.96s)]
*  So you're bullish on the idea that Doge, led by Elon, can drag the federal government into I don't even know if it's the future, but the present. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=445.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is not like dragging it into the future would be like, let's put all federal spending on a blockchain so you can have total transparency is an immutable ledger in corruption proof. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=453.32s)]
*  You know, that would be a massive undertaking because all their systems are kind of ancient. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=464.12s)]
*  I think he's trying to do just much more basic things like, hey, let's actually have a category code on each of these payments or make sure that payments to unauthorized recipients are blocked and just kind of basic accounting principles, reconciliation, etc. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=468.76s)]
*  So I think what they're trying to do is just get some of the very basic ideas working and this anybody who's worked in private industry had to kind of go in there and clean up something in a company knows this firsthand. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=484.96s)]
*  You know, there's a concept called like zero base budgeting, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=498.2s)]
*  Where you you come in with a fresh perspective and you say, okay, how many IT people should we have here? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=501.28s)]
*  How many customer sports people should we have? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=505.24s)]
*  Instead of just every year, someone asked for a little bit more budget because that's the default state of everything it wants to grow in its scope. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=507.44s)]
*  And that's a really hard thing to do. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=515.28s)]
*  But companies that don't do it eventually are unprofitable or die or go bankrupt. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=516.52s)]
*  And so that's the natural way that these things get weeded out in the private sector. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=521.2s)]
*  In the government, there is no accountability mechanism like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=524.72s)]
*  It can persist for decades or centuries, especially if you have the reserve currency that you can you can print and just get away with total lack of accountability on things. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=527.04s)]
*  So in part, this is what the beauty of Bitcoin, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=538.0s)]
*  It's it's kind of saying, hey, like if you're worried about the inflation of the dollar and deficit spending and money printing, there's a refuge from inflation. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=541.28s)]
*  And I do think actually this is crypto is going to be very good for the United States and for the dollar because through USDC and kind of a digital dollar is going to help it maintain the reserve currency. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=551.2s)]
*  But I also think Bitcoin is going to serve as a very important check and balance on inflationary spending and money printing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=560.4s)]
*  Hey, guys, Barry here. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--MNL1w3ADk&t=568.08s)]
