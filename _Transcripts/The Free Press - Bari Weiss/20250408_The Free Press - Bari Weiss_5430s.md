Depending on who you talk to, Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen are either the swampiest of swamp creatures—the epitome of all that is wrong with political journalism, suction eels on the hull of the good ship of state—or, alternatively, two of the most interesting, successful entrepreneurs in the new media landscape.

In 2006, VandeHei left The Washington Post to co-found Politico, where he was executive editor. His first hire was Mike Allen, then of Time magazine.

Politico turned into a massive hit, with Allen as its star writer. During the Obama years, Allen was so well-sourced that he became, in the words of Mark Leibovich at The New York Times, “the man the White House wakes up to.”

But then, in 2017, Mike and Jim decided to start something new—a website called Axios, which, in the beginning, was really a newsletter Mike wrote every day. They delivered news straight to your inbox and kept it short, snappy, and heavy on emojis. They called it “smart brevity.”

Their emails are filled with invocations to “go deeper” and “be smarter.” And at the end of the day, they send you an email called “Finish Line” that’s essentially life advice for young professionals on the make. A recent one advised millennials nearing middle age to begin something new, like ice skating, while another advised readers to ditch Google Maps to keep their brains sharp. It’s like MAHA for D.C.’s professional-managerial class.

They were, in a sense, pioneers of a new kind of online journalism. Long before seemingly everyone had a Substack, they were using one of the oldest internet applications—email—to get news to subscribers.

So Mike and Jim are big deals in journalism and have been for a long time.

But in case you haven’t noticed, and we don't know how you would have missed this if you listen to this show, journalism is in deep trouble. This is in large part because Americans have lost faith in journalists. According to Gallup, roughly two-thirds of Americans had a great deal of faith in the news media in 1970. Today, only 31 percent of Americans say the same—while 36 percent say they have no faith in the news media at all.

How can that trust be rebuilt? Are we destined to live in a world of different realities and alternative facts? Should the mainstream media apologize for all they have ignored or covered up or gotten wrong over the past few years?

To boil it all down: Does real, honest journalism have a future in America?

*  journalism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=113.68s)]

*  Stay with us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=170.96s)]
*  Mike Allen, Jim Van De Hei, welcome to Honestly. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=174.0s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=181.52s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=182.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=183.52s)]
*  Well, the reason I wanted to talk to both of you is not just that I love talking shop [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=184.52s)]
*  with you, which I do, but because we are at a crossroads, I think, in the history of American [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=189.2s)]
*  media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=195.56s)]
*  Anyone that listens to this show or subscribes to the free press knows that I feel that way. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=196.56s)]
*  I suspect you guys too, although perhaps from a slightly different vantage point, you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=200.48s)]
*  know, just a few things that I think about on this topic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  One is that the thing that we call the mainstream media doesn't actually seem to represent the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=208.48s)]
*  mainstream and in fact, no longer seems to capture the attention of the vast majority [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=214.22s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=220.06s)]
*  That's in other places, sort of the Wild West of podcasting, which we can talk about. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=221.06s)]
*  And the other is trust. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=225.7s)]
*  You know, no one I know that is smart and sophisticated now sort of blindly trust what [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  they listen to on NPR or trust what they read in the New York Times, perhaps with the exception [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=233.7s)]
*  of my 85 year old grandmother who believes that Rachel Maddow is the philosopher king [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=238.88s)]
*  of America and thinks that I'm a fascist. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to start by asking you, both of you, when the breakdown began, if a historian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=247.5s)]
*  comes 100 years from now and tells the story of this period, what moment do you think they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=255.4s)]
*  will choose as the origin of this unraveling unraveling both of the business model of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=261.16s)]
*  old media and maybe we can start there and also the unraveling of trust, which I think [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=268.02s)]
*  is a harder question to answer. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=272.38s)]
*  So Jeff and I grew up in legacy media came up, we met when he was working for the Wall [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=274.48s)]
*  I was working for the Washington Post, both covering George W. Bush. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=281.66s)]
*  And in 2007, we saw that the media was still acting as if it were the 1980s, that the media [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=286.42s)]
*  was still very much oriented toward evening newscasts, morning papers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  And so we said there's a way to do this with more voice, more energy, more expertise. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=302.86s)]
*  And that was Politico. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=310.22s)]
*  Flash forward and 2017 when we started Axios and we saw two things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  One that people were just getting too much was the fire hose coming at them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  And they didn't know what to believe or what to trust. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=326.42s)]
*  Barry, as you and I were coming up, you would look at the news, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=330.06s)]
*  Like you would get TV or you would read something. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=334.82000000000005s)]
*  Now we have like an info soup, info stew that comes out as all day, something from [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=337.7s)]
*  podcasts, something from Substack. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=344.14s)]
*  And so that makes a source of truth, a place that can help you see what matters, that can [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  make you smarter faster about what matters as Axios puts it, becomes infinitely valuable [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  because there's too much and there's too much junk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=359.58s)]
*  In terms of the trust question, like number one, it pains me, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=362.42s)]
*  Like I was like a child of legacy media. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=368.18s)]
*  I worked at the Washington Post. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=370.98s)]
*  I worked at the Wall Street Journal. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=372.42s)]
*  I covered the presidency. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=375.74s)]
*  I thought I had it all, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  I did a lot early in my career. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=378.54s)]
*  But the last 17 years, we've been building companies because we thought and believe the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  legacy media is fundamentally broken. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  And you asked me this question when we started Politico, like about bias and trust. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=388.9s)]
*  I would have been on the side of arguing that it was overblown, that I had been in these [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=393.5s)]
*  newsrooms back then and I watched people and I very rarely saw very blatant bias. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  What I saw was like, listen, I grew up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, small town kid, grew up [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=406.06s)]
*  in churches. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=410.82s)]
*  I own a gun. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=411.82s)]
*  I hunt. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=412.82s)]
*  I drive an F-150. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=413.82s)]
*  I realized I come from a different world than most reporters did. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=415.38000000000005s)]
*  So I thought that really affected maybe some of the issues that they covered in terms of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=419.42s)]
*  the evangelical movement or gun rights. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=424.18s)]
*  But I didn't see a ton of bias. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  When you think about trust, I feel like the trust really started to shatter over the last [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=430.62s)]
*  decade. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  I look at it in three phases. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  The first was the creation of Twitter. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=439.98s)]
*  What happened with Twitter is people forget, like now it's a lot of conservative voices, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=443.06s)]
*  a lot of independent voices. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=447.02s)]
*  It was a hotbed of liberal groupthink for a long time. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=448.82s)]
*  And it was the first time since I've been in this business that I would get on a feed [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=453.14s)]
*  and I would see reporters who I had trusted, who I had admired, making it crystal clear [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=457.9s)]
*  what their views were, what side they were on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=463.06s)]
*  You could tell in what they were tweeting and you could tell in who they were following [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=466.08s)]
*  and who was following them. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=470.02s)]
*  So I thought that was stage one because at least before any bias people had, they hid [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=472.02s)]
*  from the public. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=477.26s)]
*  Now it was in somewhat full view. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  Then came along kind of the COVID, defund the police, word policing, where I think a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=481.78s)]
*  lot of Americans were looking around and be like, how does it just sit right with me? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=489.5s)]
*  And it doesn't, in the way it's being covered, didn't sit right with them. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=493.74s)]
*  And then I think the final straw really was the coverage of Joe Biden. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=498.82s)]
*  When people were saying, hey, I can see with my own two eyes that the guy seems pretty [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=503.02s)]
*  old, probably doesn't seem capable of being the president in the next term. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=505.78s)]
*  And yet there's not a whole hell of a lot of coverage of it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=510.58s)]
*  We, you know, Alex Thompson, our White House reporter just won the White House reporting [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=513.62s)]
*  award because he was one of the few reporters to write about the decline of Joe Biden. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=518.34s)]
*  And he was bullied by other reporters for doing so. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=524.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=527.82s)]
*  Some of the very reporters who may have, you know, who will applaud him when he wins the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=528.82s)]
*  award in a couple of weeks. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=532.0200000000001s)]
*  If you go back and look at their Twitter feeds, there was a lot of people dunking on him and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=534.62s)]
*  saying, oh, that's not actually true. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=538.1400000000001s)]
*  And we're on the other ends of the calls from the White House saying that you guys are out [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=540.22s)]
*  on a limb, you're wrong, you're crazy, blah, blah, blah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=543.58s)]
*  And so I think those three things in totality really cemented the distrust that a lot of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=546.98s)]
*  people have in media. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  And it breaks my heart. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=556.9000000000001s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=557.94s)]
*  I love journalism. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=558.94s)]
*  I am a fierce, fierce defender of journalism. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=559.94s)]
*  I believe that most reporters at most institutions actually do try to get to the closest approximation [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=563.38s)]
*  of the truth and achieve it most of the time. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=568.7s)]
*  I think it's a couple of bad apples who make it look bad for everyone. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=571.22s)]
*  But regardless of the cause, like you look at the polling, look at the conversations, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  look at the market opportunity that the free press has had, there's clearly a crisis, beyond [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=579.38s)]
*  the crisis, a confidence in the legacy media, which creates openings for us at Axios. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=585.62s)]
*  Obviously, we're a different model. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=590.74s)]
*  We're not legacy media. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=592.02s)]
*  And openings for you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=593.86s)]
*  And we've watched with admiration what you've been able to build. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=595.58s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=598.3s)]
*  I want to talk more about the coverage of Biden in a little bit and also specifically [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=598.86s)]
*  Alex Thompson, who I think has covered himself in glory during a story that I think will [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=603.3s)]
*  be remembered in the anonymous, I never try and say that word out loud. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=608.3s)]
*  I hope I just did it right. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=612.74s)]
*  History of American journalism. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=614.02s)]
*  But I think one, if I were to add one additional wrinkle to the three, Jim, that you just laid [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=618.22s)]
*  out, I think what's surprising to me, what you left out is the election of Donald Trump [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=627.66s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=632.02s)]
*  What I remember so clearly from that period, and I count myself, I've talked about this, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=633.86s)]
*  I was the liberal on the Wall Street Journal editorial page, broadly speaking. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=639.02s)]
*  I then went to being the conservative on the New York Times editorial page. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=644.2199999999999s)]
*  But the day Trump won, I was at my desk, totally inappropriately dressed in leggings and a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  t-shirt because I didn't have the heart. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  I barely had the heart to put on a bra. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  And I was there sobbing in the newsroom. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=655.5799999999999s)]
*  OK, so like I was in some way, not the beating heart of what I'm about to describe, but I [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  felt alarmed, concerned. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=664.3399999999999s)]
*  I was suffering certainly from what people would describe as Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=666.86s)]
*  But then I watched when I went to the New York Times as that feeling that I had that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=671.22s)]
*  I tried to overcome, that I tried to check. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=676.7800000000001s)]
*  I watched as the whole edifice, really, of the New York Times and other places began [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=680.3000000000001s)]
*  to shift what they openly talked about their goal being. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=687.5s)]
*  In other words, it was no longer about holding up a mirror to the world as it actually is. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=691.6600000000001s)]
*  It was about open resistance to Donald Trump. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=696.18s)]
*  That was the period, of course, that The Washington Post adopted the motto democracy dies in darkness. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  And of course, adversarial journalism is very, very important. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=706.02s)]
*  But it felt at that period like it was slipping into activism. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=709.42s)]
*  And you had people talking about things like moral clarity. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=712.8599999999999s)]
*  And I want you guys to sort of go back to that moment in time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=717.7399999999999s)]
*  How important was the election of Trump and the open public response that happened from [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=721.06s)]
*  America's newsrooms to Donald Trump that was responsible for the shattering of trust that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=727.9799999999999s)]
*  we're talking about? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Barry, you put your finger on where trust meets the business model and why legacy [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=735.6999999999999s)]
*  media is so broken and why there's such an opening for new independent outlets like the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=741.8599999999999s)]
*  dogged free press and the smart brevity, the clinical insightful coverage of Axios. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=749.46s)]
*  And that is that people realize that what they were getting in the media that they were [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=758.6600000000001s)]
*  used to trusting and giving the gift of lots of their attention to, they weren't seeing [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=764.1800000000001s)]
*  much of the country. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=771.7s)]
*  They weren't seeing themselves. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=773.1800000000001s)]
*  The reason that you were in the newsroom sobbing was partly because you were surprised, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=776.02s)]
*  And the political media had one job, which was to understand America and explain it to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=783.9s)]
*  our audience. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=789.74s)]
*  And the media utterly failed at that. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=791.42s)]
*  And so you got these sort of awkward and you were present for some of these awkward efforts [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=795.74s)]
*  to fly someone from Brooklyn to a diner or air drop someone in to a VFW hall to try to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=801.2s)]
*  catch up. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=809.0s)]
*  And so that's the trust part of it that people said, like, you don't get what's happening. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=810.44s)]
*  You don't get me. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=816.84s)]
*  You're not able to explain to me these tectonic shifts that are happening in America. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=818.72s)]
*  And that's where it meets the business model that people started giving their time and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=824.32s)]
*  attention to other outlets, to newer outlets that were able to explain to them in a way [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=829.88s)]
*  that they trusted or in a way that resonated or a way that was efficient. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=835.8s)]
*  The way that we say it at Axios is we don't waste your time and we don't insult your intelligence. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=840.52s)]
*  We're in the reality space. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=845.08s)]
*  And Barry, that is not a crowded space right now. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=847.64s)]
*  And it's interesting, Barry, because we didn't, we had just started Axios, right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=850.08s)]
*  And so we didn't see it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=856.56s)]
*  When you started Axios in 2016, what month? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=858.48s)]
*  We started in, we left in 2016, started early 2017. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=861.76s)]
*  So we actually, we moved up our launch because we had the first interview with Trump. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=865.88s)]
*  So we ended up in during the transition to power. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=869.88s)]
*  And I had heard all the stories you're talking about. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=874.52s)]
*  We didn't really wrestle with that because we didn't have an opinion page. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  We're not based on raw traffic. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=881.16s)]
*  And I remember so many speeches, given the same speech then that we give now, which is [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=885.08s)]
*  we're here to be clinical, like doctors. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=890.12s)]
*  We're not here to be condescending. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=892.64s)]
*  Like if you could be skeptical, not cynical, if you could be curious, not judgmental, if [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=894.64s)]
*  you can be driven by fierce independence and not conformity, you're probably going to have [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=901.1600000000001s)]
*  a pretty good business and you're probably going to be able to figure out things like [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=905.88s)]
*  the Trump phenomenon and explain it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=909.88s)]
*  We need to explain what's happening. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=913.52s)]
*  What does the data show? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=915.8s)]
*  What do the people show? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=916.92s)]
*  And we need to be trusted by all sides. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=918.48s)]
*  And listen, we've interviewed Trump several times. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  We're tough on Trump when the reporting leads us there. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=923.96s)]
*  But we also don't hyperventilate. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=927.62s)]
*  We ask our reporters not to express their opinions in public settings. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=929.7s)]
*  We don't have an opinion page to this day. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=933.8s)]
*  We do everything in our power to try to win the trust of the persuadables. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=935.86s)]
*  There's a lot of partisans out there who don't really want truth. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=940.36s)]
*  They want reinforcement. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=942.88s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of people, and it feels like you've tapped into that market [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  as well, maybe a different part of the market, but the same market, of people who just want [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  to know what's going on. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=952.64s)]
*  They feel overwhelmed. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=954.0s)]
*  The world's changing. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=955.52s)]
*  AI is changing. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=956.72s)]
*  Media consumption is changing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=958.2s)]
*  Politics is changing. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=959.2s)]
*  Their jobs are changing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=960.4s)]
*  Their kids are changing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=961.6s)]
*  Their phones are changing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=962.6s)]
*  They just want to help to make sense of that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  So if we as reporters can do those things, be curious, don't be judgmental, if we can [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=967.08s)]
*  help be essential to people, there's a great market for that. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=972.88s)]
*  You're finding it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=977.4s)]
*  We're finding it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=978.4s)]
*  Some individual providers and a substacker are finding it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=979.4s)]
*  It's just different than the way it was when the three of us grew up. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=981.32s)]
*  Why do you think Trump decided to give you guys his first interview? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=986.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=992.04s)]
*  I think we have to think that we have good reputations of being fair-minded, tough reporters. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  We pitched it, and we ended up interviewing them several times. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=998.8399999999999s)]
*  We've been to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1001.04s)]
*  We spent a decent amount of time with them. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1002.04s)]
*  I think we probably have as good a line of sight into the Trump White House, maybe better [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1004.68s)]
*  than any other publication. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  I think if you talk to most people in the White House, they'd say, we don't love Axios. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1010.28s)]
*  They're not out there cheering for us, but that we try to get it right and that we're [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1014.68s)]
*  transparent. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1019.12s)]
*  We have a tough story coming. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1020.64s)]
*  We say, hey, you got a tough story coming, and here's your chance to comment. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1021.88s)]
*  We give a chance to comment. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1024.76s)]
*  I don't find dealing with the Trump White House ... You see a lot of people complaining, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1026.84s)]
*  oh, it's such a difficult White House to deal with, so much harder to penetrate. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1031.6s)]
*  I find it a lot easier to penetrate in many ways than the Biden White House. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1034.84s)]
*  People much more gettable and much more likely to get to the principles to find out what's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1038.96s)]
*  going on. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1044.06s)]
*  There's a lot going on, some of it wild and unprecedented and certainly worthy of being [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1045.06s)]
*  called out and explained to the American people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1049.52s)]
*  That's our job. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1053.4s)]
*  I want to spend a little bit more time talking about the recent past, which feels like it's [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1054.4s)]
*  getting memory hold and then talk for sure about Trump. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1058.48s)]
*  I think when certain of my listeners, maybe those that lean more to the right, hear you, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1061.96s)]
*  Jim, describe the average person in the legacy press business was striving to get to the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  truth. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1073.72s)]
*  Then they'll think about moments, choose your moment. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1074.72s)]
*  For me, the ultimate pinnacle was, I think it was Kenosha in the summer of 2020, CNN [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1077.08s)]
*  reporter standing in front of buildings burning to the ground. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1085.04s)]
*  It looked like I'm seen out of the movie Mad Max and the chyron at the bottom said, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1090.6399999999999s)]
*  fiery but mostly peaceful protest. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  There's one way to read that where you're like, someone was foolish and wrote that language. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  Then the other way to read it, if you're someone that tends to be more skeptical of the legacy [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1103.48s)]
*  press or the idea that as you were describing, Jim, it's sort of a monoculture of people [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1107.44s)]
*  from the same backgrounds, the same schools with rare exceptions like you, it will feel [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  like something, not a conspiracy, but something closer to an active attempt to sort of usher [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1116.8400000000001s)]
*  the viewer or usher the reader toward the correct political conclusion rather than sort [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1125.44s)]
*  of laying out reality to them and letting them draw their own. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1132.58s)]
*  Talk to me, both of you, if you could, about where does the truth lie between those two [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1137.54s)]
*  things? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1142.34s)]
*  You know, a bunch of sloppy mistakes all leading in one direction politically over the past [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1143.34s)]
*  decade or so, especially over the past four years of the Biden administration or, you [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1149.92s)]
*  know, a reflection of just the monoculture of the newsroom that leads toward bias in [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1155.46s)]
*  a certain direction or something more not a nefarious is maybe too strong a word, but [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1160.98s)]
*  something more intentional. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1166.7s)]
*  Which is it? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1168.5s)]
*  I think groupthink can be like pancreatic cancer, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1170.3s)]
*  It can spread pretty rapidly and it could be hard. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1173.42s)]
*  It could be hard to undo. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1176.66s)]
*  And I think we certainly went through a period where with a lot of the media, you did see [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1178.66s)]
*  a lot of that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1183.22s)]
*  So on the one hand, I'm sympathetic to people who have that frustration. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1184.22s)]
*  I guess on the other hand, like, let's take the New York Times, which I think most conservatives [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1188.62s)]
*  would say, oh, it's just it's liberal. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1192.4599999999998s)]
*  It has this massive agenda. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1194.34s)]
*  You might feel that way. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1196.4199999999998s)]
*  I will say as somebody who reads a lot, like probably a stupid amount every single day, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1197.82s)]
*  and I feel like I know a decent amount, particularly on topics like artificial intelligence, business, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1203.1399999999999s)]
*  and the operations of the Trump White House. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1208.8999999999999s)]
*  I'd say that most of the stuff that falls into those three buckets that the New York [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1211.4199999999998s)]
*  Times produces is pretty darn good, pretty high quality, pretty accurate, certainly on [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1214.98s)]
*  the stories where I feel like I have some domain expertise and some line of sight on. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1220.9s)]
*  There's some reporters who I think are biased. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1225.46s)]
*  I just don't read them. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1226.9s)]
*  And obviously, I'm in a different position than you are to Barry and as is Mike, that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1227.9s)]
*  we know a lot of these people, we kind of know what to read and not to read. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1231.9s)]
*  But for the most part, I feel like they are trying to get to the closest approximation [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1234.5s)]
*  of the truth. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1237.74s)]
*  I think where you really saw that groupthink hardened is around the topics that you're [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1238.74s)]
*  talking about. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1242.38s)]
*  I think you've even mentioned to me that time we had dinner, this idea, it's like, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1243.5s)]
*  don't... [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1249.62s)]
*  And I think about this about politics. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1250.62s)]
*  Don't ask the American people not to believe their own two eyes. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1252.22s)]
*  Like you're going to get yourself in trouble. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1255.02s)]
*  If you're a politician and you say that someone doesn't seem too old or not capable and they [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1257.5s)]
*  look and seem very too old and maybe not capable, people are going to call BS. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1261.38s)]
*  So you've got a good BS sniff around the American people. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1267.02s)]
*  We're smart. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1269.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1270.18s)]
*  Well, that's a perfect transition to talk a little bit more deeply about. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1271.18s)]
*  To me, what was the biggest miss story, or if you look at it another way, the biggest [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1273.14s)]
*  cover up, depending on your politics, of the past four years in American life. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1279.0200000000002s)]
*  And that was the mental acuity of the president of the United States. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1283.74s)]
*  During the last election cycle, it felt like you could get a much clearer read on the president's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1290.5800000000002s)]
*  state from looking at videos of him walking around the world than I could get on the front [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1298.98s)]
*  pages of some of America's greatest newspapers, with the rare exception of your reporter, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1305.1000000000001s)]
*  Alex Thompson, who continued to doggedly calmly pursue the story and as we talked about before, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1312.06s)]
*  didn't get so much love from other journalists for doing so. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1319.1000000000001s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1322.74s)]
*  Not with Alex necessarily, although we could talk about why he got it right, but it was [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1324.38s)]
*  something that seemed so obvious, especially as the campaign went on. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1328.7s)]
*  And we'll talk about the debate in a second. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1332.94s)]
*  But what explains the failure? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1334.8200000000002s)]
*  Is it a lack of curiosity? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1337.6200000000001s)]
*  Was it the White House successfully spinning people? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1339.74s)]
*  How do you explain what happened, Mike? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1343.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Barry, this was all the worst parts of reporter brain coming together. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1346.42s)]
*  There is the group think, the mono think that you were talking about. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1352.76s)]
*  You add to it another piece of what you were just talking about is cluelessness. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1358.24s)]
*  This is where the American people see something, sense something, and they're not seeing it [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1364.16s)]
*  reflected in news outlets that they used to trust. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1369.6s)]
*  And so specifically with the Biden health, people discounted what they saw with their [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1374.68s)]
*  own eyes, ignored it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  And this is the reporter group think part of it, that there is an insecurity, a herd [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1382.76s)]
*  mentality. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1389.84s)]
*  You don't want to be separate is the typical reporter instinct. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1391.24s)]
*  And you know, the three of us have made great lives and great innovation by saying we did [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1400.28s)]
*  want to be the one that's different, but it's the hardest thing to teach your kid. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1410.44s)]
*  It's hard to teach a reporter. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1415.16s)]
*  We tell our reporters, if you go somewhere and there's two other reporters, you can leave. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1418.0s)]
*  There's no story. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1423.24s)]
*  If there is, we'll see it on TV. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1424.3200000000002s)]
*  But Mike, what did the herd, I agree with you that herd mentality group think is incredibly [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1426.3200000000002s)]
*  powerful. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1431.16s)]
*  It's something we all learned in COVID. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1432.16s)]
*  But what did the herd want in this case, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1433.44s)]
*  The herd wanted the approval of the White House, connectivity of the White House. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1436.0s)]
*  They didn't want to look like they were being ideological on Twitter or another social media, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1442.92s)]
*  when in fact they were being clinical. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1454.16s)]
*  And so let's reverse engineer what Alex Thompson did, which is aged well, as they say. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1456.04s)]
*  He saw with his own eyes, he was talking to people in the Biden White House and who dealt [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1463.66s)]
*  with the Biden White House, who were able to tell him, and Jim and I were hearing this [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1470.18s)]
*  in our conversations too, we have lots of people tell us, you had to catch the president [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1476.26s)]
*  between 10 and 4. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1481.78s)]
*  The Biden had good hours between 10 and 4. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  And those were the only reasons, that was the only time he could really count on connecting [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1487.8200000000002s)]
*  with him. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1492.42s)]
*  These were people who worked for him. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1493.42s)]
*  These were people in the administration on the payroll who were telling us this. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1494.8600000000001s)]
*  And a crazy thing happened. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1500.22s)]
*  That window shrunk as the months go by. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1502.14s)]
*  There were fewer and fewer good hours. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1505.6200000000001s)]
*  And so Alex paid attention. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1509.66s)]
*  He paid 360 attention to his beat, which is very rare. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1511.66s)]
*  When you're covering an institution, a person, you have two jobs. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1517.3000000000002s)]
*  One is what's in front of your face, right? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1521.86s)]
*  Like what are they saying? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1523.82s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1524.82s)]
*  But the much more valuable and important part of your job, and the one that can make an [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1525.82s)]
*  outlet like Axios or the free press infinitely valuable, is if you can look at why are they [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1530.62s)]
*  doing these things? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1537.84s)]
*  What are the inputs? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1538.9799999999998s)]
*  Like what are they, who are they talking to? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1539.9799999999998s)]
*  Like what's the advice you're getting? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1542.58s)]
*  And when you talk to that half of the brain, we all saw that something was missing and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1544.06s)]
*  changing fast in that White House. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1549.2199999999998s)]
*  We'd all covered him as vice president. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1551.66s)]
*  And every time there was a Barack Obama documentary, the most interesting part of it was, one of [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1554.94s)]
*  the most interesting parts was just how different Biden looked. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1561.0600000000002s)]
*  And so other reporters, they didn't want to have the ferocious pushback of some of those [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1565.22s)]
*  most powerful people in America. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1572.5s)]
*  They were inclined to believe those people. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1575.7s)]
*  They didn't want to be separated from their colleagues, ironically, because we all know [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1579.86s)]
*  that that's how you get the good story. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1583.9599999999998s)]
*  And Alex was methodical. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1587.1399999999999s)]
*  You look back at the stories, and it was tiles in a mosaic. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1590.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, now he's wearing sneakers instead of big boy shoes. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1595.3s)]
*  Now they're using the baby stares on Air Force One. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1599.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, now he has walkers that help him get from the Oval Office to Marine One. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1603.3s)]
*  It was all in front of our eyes. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1608.98s)]
*  And you talk to people inside, and this is one of the most fascinating parts of Alex's [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1612.46s)]
*  reporting, that he reported uniquely, was how much even people inside were being shielded [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1619.3400000000001s)]
*  from the president. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1625.18s)]
*  Like very normal interactions with the president or with a boss. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1626.9s)]
*  People very close to them were kept away from it. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1632.66s)]
*  And so, story by story, tile by tile, he told that story. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1635.58s)]
*  And because he was a respected reporter, and because Axios is a respected outlet with an [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1641.02s)]
*  enviable audience, the White House dealt with each of those stories. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1647.3s)]
*  And we kept the trust of those people, even though they hated the stories, they were very [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1653.46s)]
*  tough stories. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1658.54s)]
*  But back when I started covering the White House, one of the first things that one of [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  the old timers told me is they said, if you just write what they want, they won't have [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1665.02s)]
*  to deal with you. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1669.06s)]
*  And this was another way that we saw that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1670.18s)]
*  And there is a timidity to reporters that has frustrated me for a long, long time. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1672.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1677.58s)]
*  Like think about you, Mike, me. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1678.58s)]
*  All three of us left what people would have said were the great publications in America, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1680.94s)]
*  kind of at a moment where we were all peeking in our careers to do something that no one [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1686.46s)]
*  else was doing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1692.26s)]
*  There's very few people who do that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1693.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1695.54s)]
*  Like most reporters, I always argue they're happy to be spectators, observers, as opposed [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1696.54s)]
*  to like fearless in fearless pursuit of the truth. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1702.14s)]
*  Like you've got to, like I try to teach reporters all the time, there's no value in being liked. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1706.74s)]
*  You need people to fear you, not fear you because you're reckless, fear you because [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1712.66s)]
*  you know. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1716.2s)]
*  And even if they say they're going to shut you out, even if they say you're dead to them, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1717.6s)]
*  they will talk to you because they can tell you know what you're talking about and you [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1722.34s)]
*  have the stones to write it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1726.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think if you can do those things, you stand out as a reporter like Alex did, or [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1729.26s)]
*  as an entrepreneur like you are. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1733.54s)]
*  And it's just a minority. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1735.78s)]
*  But I think that curiosity or that ferocious, you know, ambition to get to the truth, it's [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1737.26s)]
*  like a liability in two ways. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1744.3s)]
*  One is in the partisan way where if you are inclined to want Biden to be president, you [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1746.26s)]
*  don't want to look there in the case of this story, although we could point to a million [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1751.3s)]
*  stories. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1754.94s)]
*  And then the other goes back to where we were earlier in this conversation, which is the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1755.94s)]
*  power that at least before it became X, now it's a totally different beast, the power [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1760.02s)]
*  that the group acting as a mob on Twitter could, the way that they could shame and harm [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1765.82s)]
*  journalists that dared not go along with the group. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1776.86s)]
*  I was very wordy way of saying people don't like bullies and they don't get like getting [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1780.3s)]
*  publicly shamed. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1784.18s)]
*  And as we all know, during the Trump years, that became a part of the job, like managing [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1785.86s)]
*  your reputation on places like Twitter, at least if you worked at a place like the New [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1791.54s)]
*  York Times, maybe it wasn't the case at Axios. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1795.78s)]
*  When did you like I would love for you guys to take listeners into the internal conversations [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1800.1s)]
*  you had. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1805.3s)]
*  I don't know if either of you are Alex's personal editor, but how you guys thought and talked [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1807.34s)]
*  in the newsroom about telling the story of Biden's decline? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1812.54s)]
*  And when you knew personally that it was an enormous issue, because I imagine you both [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1817.74s)]
*  understood that in a way that the American people really only fully grok'd it the night [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1822.84s)]
*  of that infamous debate. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1828.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one little bit of context for your listeners on Axios, like our core audience [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1829.5s)]
*  is insiders. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1835.82s)]
*  Like we proudly are trying to write for political leaders, business leaders, tech leaders, media [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1836.82s)]
*  leaders, people who know a lot. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1841.6599999999999s)]
*  This is why like Sarah Fisher's media business coverage for me is like essential reading. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1843.62s)]
*  But I imagine for many people in the country, it's like, why do you need to know my new [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1849.82s)]
*  details of this? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1853.74s)]
*  And it's like, I need to know every single thing she publishes. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1854.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1857.26s)]
*  And so like, the thing with our people know us for politics is we're in DC, and we break [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1858.26s)]
*  a lot of news, but we're still really trying to write for kind of the most sophisticated, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1861.66s)]
*  powerful people in the country. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1865.8600000000001s)]
*  Because of that, like Mike and I are lucky enough to talk to the political leaders, the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1868.3000000000002s)]
*  CEOs on a very regular basis. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1872.8600000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, a lot of it is like, we were picking this up, like we're hearing this, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1874.74s)]
*  like people were having interactions, just being candid about the interactions with the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1879.46s)]
*  president. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1883.8200000000002s)]
*  At the same time, Alex is doing his job, he's doing reporting. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1884.8200000000002s)]
*  And he's coming to us and saying, Hey, this is what I have. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1888.5s)]
*  And then you know the editorial process, you want to stress test it, are you sure we're [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1891.46s)]
*  kind of out on a limb? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1894.54s)]
*  He's got the goods, then write it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1896.1000000000001s)]
*  And it was like, it wasn't like we set out to we are going to be the publication who [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1898.5s)]
*  exposes the decline of Joe Biden. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1902.4s)]
*  No, no, that's not what I mean. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1904.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, when you have someone that is so out there ahead of the pack or saying something [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1905.58s)]
*  totally orthogonal to what everyone else is saying, how do you, I don't know, I just wonder [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1910.54s)]
*  if it's like, well, wait, is it possible they all got it wrong? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1916.64s)]
*  And we're the only ones that got it right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1919.66s)]
*  Because we were talking to so many people off the record who are saying like, you're [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1921.18s)]
*  validating it right. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1925.18s)]
*  There was being somewhat sympathetic to other reporters. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1926.5s)]
*  The White House was run like an oligarchy. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1930.66s)]
*  You had five or six people around Joe Biden who'd been around him for 30, 40 years who [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1932.94s)]
*  loved the man whose power was derived wholly from the man. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1937.26s)]
*  And they believed in him. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1942.78s)]
*  I believe they believed in their hearts. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1943.94s)]
*  He could do the job because they saw him in those moments of of high acuity, which did [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1945.34s)]
*  happen in different parts of the day. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1950.06s)]
*  And so you really, really had to have good sourcing. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1952.54s)]
*  You had to have the trust of at least a couple of the people that were around that inner [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1956.02s)]
*  circle to be able to give you kind of a wink in the nod that you're not off. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1959.62s)]
*  And then you write it and you take the phone calls and you protect Alex and you say, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1963.22s)]
*  keep doing your job. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1968.98s)]
*  And Alex did his job. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1970.7s)]
*  And I think any great reporter does that. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1972.7s)]
*  And, you know, we had it with Jonathan Swan in the first term with Trump, a lot of tough [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1976.1799999999998s)]
*  coverage of Trump, probably the toughest, most entertaining, maybe best interview ever [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1981.86s)]
*  of a presidential campaign was Swan working for us doing Trump. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1986.34s)]
*  It was tough based on his tough reporting. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1989.9399999999998s)]
*  But like he was always right. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1993.02s)]
*  And a lot of people were wrong in some of the coverage of Trump, but we were right. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1995.4599999999998s)]
*  And it just requires like finding those reporters who have that fearlessness and that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=1999.3s)]
*  curiosity and the smarts having really smart editors who can back them up and push [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2003.62s)]
*  them and stress test things. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2009.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's why reporting matters. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2011.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, I really, really believe and I hope for your listeners who are skeptical of [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2012.6999999999998s)]
*  reporting and in the industry like I love this country, man. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2017.62s)]
*  I am a product of it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2020.6599999999999s)]
*  And there's not you're not going to find a bigger homer for America than me. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2022.82s)]
*  The fact that I could be a dipshit in Wisconsin, come here, do big things to our [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2026.1399999999999s)]
*  companies, interview interview presidents. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2029.7s)]
*  But a big part of that, a big part of that is a free press. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2033.66s)]
*  If you look back, hence your name, a big part of that is is the fact that we have that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2037.42s)]
*  it differentiates us. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2042.5800000000002s)]
*  The fact that we have people who can ask presidents tough questions and not get killed [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2044.3000000000002s)]
*  like you might in Russia or in prison, like you might in China or Korea or Iran. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2048.54s)]
*  There's something special about this country. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2054.14s)]
*  And I think a free press sits at the middle of that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2055.86s)]
*  And so I hope, hope, hope that over the next couple of years, we, the media, with a very [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2058.66s)]
*  elastic definition of that, can rebuild some of that trust so that people feel like they [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2064.8599999999997s)]
*  have a pretty good panoramic view of what's happening in the country so they can make [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2070.7s)]
*  better decisions. And if we can do that, then this experiment will continue to flourish. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2075.38s)]
*  And there's no reason that it shouldn't. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2079.7s)]
*  But if you shut it down and there is no truth and there's only your reality playing with [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2081.38s)]
*  fire. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2086.7s)]
*  I don't think it's unique to reporters that they want to be liked. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2087.54s)]
*  I think that's a human thing to want to be in the in-crowd, to want to be in the tribe. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2091.02s)]
*  And it's an exceptional person that's comfortable with being disliked. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2094.74s)]
*  And and they're just it's a certain type of personality that is what people would call [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2099.54s)]
*  disagreeable. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2106.58s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a judgmental or in a judgmental way, just certain people like [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2107.58s)]
*  I'm married to someone who is highly disagreeable. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2112.14s)]
*  I seem like someone that is disagreeable, but in fact, I am much more agreeable than [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2115.06s)]
*  her and much less prone to confrontation, despite my reputation. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you think that Alex Thompson and broadening it beyond him, he's going to get a lot his [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2123.7000000000003s)]
*  ears are going to be burning from this conversation. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2128.34s)]
*  But do you think that the reporters who are most successful at breaking scoops, the [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2130.38s)]
*  reporters that stand out and get the story right and are comfortable being against her, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2138.1800000000003s)]
*  do you think there's some qualities that they share that makes them comfortable with [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2143.26s)]
*  being sort of out of step? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2150.26s)]
*  Well, I don't because look at me and Mike, like I would say, like I am the rare [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2153.6200000000003s)]
*  you're disagreeable. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2158.7000000000003s)]
*  I could give a shit if you like me or don't like me. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2160.1000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. Mike is the agreeable one. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2162.0600000000004s)]
*  As long as I look at my values and my principles, like I don't have I don't have a massive [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2163.0600000000004s)]
*  desire to be liked or I do by people that know me and love me, then I have a huge desire [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2167.5s)]
*  to. But Mike is somebody who everybody loves. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2172.7s)]
*  He's one of the most beloved, maybe the most generous, gracious person I've ever met in [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2175.22s)]
*  my life. He is the one person who cleans up after a party and pays for everybody's tab. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2179.3399999999997s)]
*  And yet I see you've never seen him flinch in the face of tough journalism. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2184.74s)]
*  And he's practiced a ton of tough journalism. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2189.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I don't think you have to be disagreeable. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2193.2999999999997s)]
*  I do think you have to really live by a fierce belief in truth. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2196.4199999999996s)]
*  A you have to have this insatiable appetite to talk to as many people so you can get to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2200.86s)]
*  that truth. And you have to believe in the power of the press. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2205.7400000000002s)]
*  You have to breathe in the power of truth over time. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2209.98s)]
*  And Mike might come at it differently than you do. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2212.9s)]
*  It sounds like the two of you are more alike. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2215.02s)]
*  I'm more like your wife, I guess. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2216.94s)]
*  So you are. You're more Nellie. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2218.1s)]
*  I think that's the DNA, like a love and a fierce belief in truth. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2219.98s)]
*  Mike, I just want to pick up on and point to you what Jim just said. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2224.98s)]
*  You are one of the most generous, but also just you seem to never stop working, never [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2228.78s)]
*  stop texting, never stop sort of like touching, having touch points with people that you want [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2235.78s)]
*  to build relationships with. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2241.0600000000004s)]
*  What's your what is the Mike Allen secret sauce? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2242.78s)]
*  Because I think one way of being a journalist is the sort of thing that people imagine from [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2245.26s)]
*  movies that they've seen about journalists, which is like punching directly in the face. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2250.5s)]
*  You have a much more gracious sort of hug, kind of an embrace of people that you want [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2255.06s)]
*  to get to know. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2260.1400000000003s)]
*  What is your strategy for getting the story? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2261.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, Barry, the part of the instinct is and this is again where the business model [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2263.1400000000003s)]
*  and the trust come together, that if I'm telling you things that the herd is saying, that's [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2270.58s)]
*  not valuable. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2276.98s)]
*  And what we found with Axios is if we're bringing you distinctive, clinical, illuminating, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2279.1s)]
*  trustworthy journalism, that becomes incredibly valuable. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2286.5s)]
*  Now how do we get there? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2291.5s)]
*  My approach is just pure curiosity. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2294.06s)]
*  That I'm curious about how you've built a hell of a business. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2297.86s)]
*  I'm very curious about that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2303.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm curious about your audience. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2305.5s)]
*  I'm curious about the hurdles that you faced. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2307.5s)]
*  And that's going to be my approach in any journalistic situation is like I just honestly [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2312.02s)]
*  want to know. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2321.06s)]
*  And like that gives the other person the opportunity to maybe tell you more than they would if [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2323.02s)]
*  you were playing 20 questions. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2329.7s)]
*  And I'm going to keep my distance and I'm going to have a clinical, hygienic, honest [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2332.7799999999997s)]
*  report. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2337.3399999999997s)]
*  But I'm going to learn as much as I can about you. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2339.1s)]
*  And that is my instinctive personality. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2342.2999999999997s)]
*  But that also turns out to be a journalistic superpower. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2345.14s)]
*  Because I honestly want to know, want to hear, and I'm curious and that makes for great stories. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2349.1s)]
*  And I'll give you a little life lesson for the young listeners out there. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2357.2599999999998s)]
*  I've seen a student of Mike who I think the closest parallel is Mr. Rogers, Fred Rogers. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2360.82s)]
*  But he, I watched him 25 years ago and to this day, he treats the person on the plane [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2366.3s)]
*  carrying the bag or the person setting up dinner for the White House crew or the junior [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2373.34s)]
*  staff or the person answering the phone exactly the way he would treat the White House Chief [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2379.86s)]
*  of Staff. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2384.9s)]
*  He treats, he's equally interested and equally kind to all of them. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2385.9s)]
*  And he does it because he's a naturally kind, gracious person. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2390.14s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2393.3s)]
*  That person who is answering the phone or carrying the bag or setting up an appointment, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2394.3s)]
*  one day becomes the White House Chief of Staff. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2398.94s)]
*  And when you're in the town a long time and somebody has been kind to you and has created [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2401.7400000000002s)]
*  this relationship of trust and suddenly you know something sensitive, guess who you might [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2406.56s)]
*  share that with? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2411.58s)]
*  Mike Allen. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2412.94s)]
*  And so it's just a cool life lesson in watching how you don't have to be a hard charging, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2413.94s)]
*  son of a bitch to be able to get people to respond to you. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2419.2599999999998s)]
*  There's many ways to get it done. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2421.9s)]
*  I just want to close the Biden conversation. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2423.8599999999997s)]
*  Would you guys say that from the vantage point of, I guess we're talking in early April 2025, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2426.22s)]
*  that much of the media was complicit in a cover up of Biden's mental decline? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2432.38s)]
*  Would you use the word cover up? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2438.74s)]
*  I just don't, I'll probably get pounded for this. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2441.74s)]
*  I just don't think that the media and reporters are that strategic to conspire on something [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2444.94s)]
*  of that scale. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2454.02s)]
*  I think they're complicit in that they should have done better reporting. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2455.1s)]
*  They should have believed their own eyes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  They should have been skeptical of the people closest to Biden. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2460.62s)]
*  They should have taken Alex's and Axios's reporting a lot more seriously. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2464.3s)]
*  To say it the way you said it, it just sounds more conspiratorial and coordinated than I [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2469.6400000000003s)]
*  would ever give the legacy media for being. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2475.1600000000003s)]
*  Would it be fair to say that they chose to believe Jen Psaki over their own lying eyes? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2479.76s)]
*  Again, I can't get into their hearts, but you saw, we saw, we wrote, a few others wrote. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2486.56s)]
*  It's up to them and their conscience to figure out why they made the decisions that they [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2496.64s)]
*  made. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2500.04s)]
*  And part of it is just a plain lapse, right? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2501.04s)]
*  This is the cluelessness. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2504.7599999999998s)]
*  This is one thing that the free press lowercase gives you the privilege and the obligation [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2505.96s)]
*  and the ability to do is to type or speak what's in front of your face, what you're [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2512.8399999999997s)]
*  observing, what you're being told. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2518.72s)]
*  That's why we have the countless continuous conversations is because very quickly you [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2522.84s)]
*  learn when you have multiple people pointing you the same way, you just have to believe [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2530.1600000000003s)]
*  it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2536.28s)]
*  The flip is inside, and this is where Alex Thompson has a book, Coming Original Sin with [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2537.28s)]
*  Jake Tapper. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2544.36s)]
*  We see a lot of reporting about to what degree inside it was deliberate. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2545.36s)]
*  It was known. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2552.72s)]
*  That's what I'm curious to learn more about. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2553.92s)]
*  If either of you, both of you are, you know, you guys are running Axios, the word hygienic [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2556.72s)]
*  is one you've used several times, which I love. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2560.96s)]
*  I feel that way. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2563.08s)]
*  I would never have thought of that word, but I feel that way about Axios. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2564.08s)]
*  I feel like it's crisp and clean and to the point in a way that I really appreciate as [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2566.6s)]
*  a busy person. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2571.46s)]
*  Neither of you has the burden of running a place like the New York Times or the Washington [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2573.08s)]
*  Post at the moment. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  If you were in charge of running one of those places and choose either one, different challenges [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2578.58s)]
*  of you, obviously with each, what are the first three things you would do to build back [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2584.58s)]
*  not just the trust of your hardcore readers who are going to be with you the whole way, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2590.98s)]
*  but to win new audiences and to convince them that you are deserving of their trust once [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2595.3s)]
*  more? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2600.78s)]
*  Mike, let's do you. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2601.78s)]
*  I don't like Jim Goffert. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2604.2200000000003s)]
*  He's giving me support. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2607.02s)]
*  I have zero desire. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2608.02s)]
*  I'm playing a game with you, Mike. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2609.02s)]
*  She knew you wouldn't answer the question. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2611.02s)]
*  I have zero desire to run the Washington Post with the New York Times. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2612.54s)]
*  Well, yes, clearly. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2615.22s)]
*  Well, first off, one is a very good business and one is a crappy one, so I would choose [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2616.22s)]
*  the New York Times. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2619.46s)]
*  Okay, so let's choose the New York Times, a gaming business with an Anselaer News business. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2620.46s)]
*  You know, I don't know that we would do, I think our principles are pretty clear. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2624.18s)]
*  Remember, we've been at these institutions and we did Politico. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2627.3s)]
*  We learned from Politico. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2630.1s)]
*  We did Axios. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2631.1s)]
*  pretty firm philosophy, which is number one, either I'd have no opinion page or I'd have [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2633.1s)]
*  a hell of a lot more, I'd have a much more elastic ideological spectrum of people like [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2639.62s)]
*  who are on the opinion page so it doesn't feel like it's one sided. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2645.66s)]
*  Two, I would tell reporters you're done expressing your opinion in public settings. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2649.62s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2654.42s)]
*  You're not paid to opine. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2655.42s)]
*  You're not paid to opine on TV. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2657.62s)]
*  Your job is to be a doctor and to be clinical and to break news. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2659.44s)]
*  And then I would continue to do what we do at Axios, which is really put an emphasis [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2664.12s)]
*  on finding those special reporters who are fearless enough to tell the hard truths, who [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2669.0s)]
*  have enough domain expertise to speak to both a sophisticated and a general audience and [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  try to be vital. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  Like the only companies, your company, my company, New York Times, Post, none of us [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2682.48s)]
*  will survive unless we are absolutely vital to a certain set of people. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2687.08s)]
*  Might be different sets of people. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2692.72s)]
*  Maybe some are better for advertisers and some are better for subscriptions. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2694.52s)]
*  But if you're not vital, you're not essential, you are dead, dead, dead. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2698.52s)]
*  There's no market for mediocrity. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2703.16s)]
*  There's no market for just noise for noise sake. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2705.44s)]
*  You've got to be essential, especially if you want to be in the serious news space, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2708.2799999999997s)]
*  to enough people to justify a business. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2712.72s)]
*  I had Jay Bhattacharya, the new head of the NIH, on the podcast earlier this week. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2715.6600000000003s)]
*  He gave his first interview to us and we were talking about how to bring, it's a similar [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2721.7000000000003s)]
*  conversation in a way. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2726.62s)]
*  How does public health, public health authorities win back trust post-COVID? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2727.82s)]
*  We were talking about Francis Collins and how Francis Collins, who had called Jay dangerous [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2734.26s)]
*  and fringe when he ran the NIH, now privately apologized to Jay. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2740.46s)]
*  And I wonder if a public apology at some point will be in the offing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2744.5s)]
*  Do you think that the heads of the New York Times or the Washington Post or any of these [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2748.2200000000003s)]
*  places that got a lot of these stories wrong, do you think they should consider an apology, Mike? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2751.34s)]
*  I would consider more reporting on stories that we know that we got wrong. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2758.02s)]
*  We should tell that story because winning back trust, it's like in a relationship. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2764.18s)]
*  It's not going to be what you say. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2768.9s)]
*  It's not going to be a conversation. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2771.46s)]
*  It's what do I do over time? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2773.94s)]
*  And that's how the one way that the media landscape has really changed. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2776.6600000000003s)]
*  Jim and I have written a couple of columns on the idea of shards of glass, that the media [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2780.2200000000003s)]
*  ecosystem that we all grew up with, where we were all looking through one window, has [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2785.3s)]
*  now shattered. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2790.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2791.98s)]
*  And we're all in different pieces with very little overlap. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2792.98s)]
*  And the trust will come from over time if I decide, if I conclude that this outlet is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2797.86s)]
*  trying to get to the closest approximation of the truth with the available facts, and [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2805.54s)]
*  that it reflects and uncovers and illuminates the reality that I see in my life and that [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2811.02s)]
*  my siblings see across the country and that people are seeing beyond the bubbles. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2820.42s)]
*  And that's not something that comes from a statement or a seminar or a podcast. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2828.54s)]
*  It comes from minute by minute, hourly work, probably over a very long time. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2835.5s)]
*  The media is in a very deep trust hole. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2840.38s)]
*  In many cases, we deserve it for the reasons we've been talking about here. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2843.94s)]
*  And it's only going to be over time that we'll win that back. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2848.14s)]
*  And whether it's government or the NIH or us or churches, like, one, I'm a big believer [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2851.46s)]
*  you have to have some institutions that unite the citizens of this country. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2857.2599999999998s)]
*  We need a common fabric. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2862.3399999999997s)]
*  There's no doubt that people have lost faith in almost every institution, and that explains [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2864.2599999999998s)]
*  a lot of the unhappiness, a lot of the distrust. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2868.52s)]
*  And so then how do people who run institutions, how do you win back trust, whether it's the [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2872.44s)]
*  media or the NIH? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2877.2999999999997s)]
*  Number one, be competent. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2879.06s)]
*  Be competent. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2881.14s)]
*  Be really useful to people. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2882.14s)]
*  Be authentic. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2884.8799999999997s)]
*  If you screw shit up, say, I'm sorry. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2885.9199999999996s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2888.5s)]
*  Don't try to hide it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2889.5s)]
*  People are really forgiving if they feel like you're the real deal. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2890.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think that we need that rebound. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2894.64s)]
*  We need the resilience of institutions. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2897.3799999999997s)]
*  The life today is, I look at my kids, it's just so much different. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2901.02s)]
*  When I was a kid, I went to church, I hung out with priests. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2904.18s)]
*  I was in the Boy Scouts, right? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2907.18s)]
*  There were labor unions. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2909.64s)]
*  People trusted business. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2911.7s)]
*  People thought serving in government was great. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2913.7599999999998s)]
*  Everyone loved the military, the FBI. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2916.22s)]
*  We had these common things that held us together. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2919.14s)]
*  And for a lot of reasons, a lot of which you've uncovered and talked about on the show over [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2922.98s)]
*  time, all of us have lost trust. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2929.14s)]
*  And I think that there's like an American project that has to take place to restore [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2931.3s)]
*  some of these institutions from government to media. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2935.3s)]
*  And what the three of us can control is media. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2937.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think we're a good representation that it's happening for all the, oh my God, media [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2940.4s)]
*  is dead. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2944.42s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2945.42s)]
*  There's more good information available to every single person on this planet with an [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2946.42s)]
*  internet connection on more topics with more depth based on more expertise than at any [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2949.7400000000002s)]
*  point in humanity. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2954.82s)]
*  It's not close, not even close. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2956.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, there's a lot more garbage sitting side by side with it. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2958.62s)]
*  But if you're a discerning consumer, you don't think that you could get a hell of a lot smarter [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2962.58s)]
*  today than you could have 25 years ago? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2966.7s)]
*  Give me a break, not close. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2969.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2970.94s)]
*  Mike, how many days are we right now into the second Trump administration? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2972.14s)]
*  74. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2976.42s)]
*  74. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2977.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2978.42s)]
*  It's felt like one long day for those of us in the media business. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2979.42s)]
*  It has felt like a fire hose. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2982.22s)]
*  And there you have a spoiler for you. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2984.22s)]
*  That means that there's around 1400 left. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2985.72s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2988.7000000000003s)]
*  What are the, I think, and this is just my sense, I might be wrong, that people are tuning [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2989.7000000000003s)]
*  out a little bit just because there is such an enormous amount of information. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=2997.42s)]
*  We try to the extent that we can to synthesize and explain to people and separate the signal [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3003.02s)]
*  from the noise, tell them what are like the true fault lines in the Mac movement, what [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3009.98s)]
*  really matters, what's just hysteria. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3014.0600000000004s)]
*  But Mike, you're so close to this story. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3017.1s)]
*  I read you, I mean, I don't even know how many emails I get from you a day, but it's [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3021.3399999999997s)]
*  a lot and there's a lot of information in there. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3024.66s)]
*  What are the top three themes or three stories that you feel have typified the administration [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3027.18s)]
*  so far that you think are the things people should really be paying attention to? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3033.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like three tectonic plates that are moving and something that I emphasize to our [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3038.06s)]
*  team, to every audience that I talk to, that the day by day noise, it can be either overwhelming [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3046.74s)]
*  or it can be disconcerting or you can think that it's erratic. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3055.66s)]
*  But what's happening hour to hour really matters. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3061.02s)]
*  This is Shakespeare, like a thousand years from now. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3067.18s)]
*  People will study these characters, what's happening. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3070.74s)]
*  You could pick any week of the 11 weeks that they've been and you could write a book about [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3075.3s)]
*  it, people will. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3080.86s)]
*  So three themes. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3082.9s)]
*  One is the confidence of President Trump. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3084.6600000000003s)]
*  That was one over those four years in the wilderness when he thought he might be spending [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3088.78s)]
*  a lot of the rest of his life in courtrooms. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3095.0600000000004s)]
*  He was told White House or big house, like those are the stakes. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3098.38s)]
*  He came back from that. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3104.34s)]
*  He's in there, what else builds his confidence? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3106.1000000000004s)]
*  He has people in the Senate, people in the House, who are there only because of him, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3108.46s)]
*  strength that he did not have last time and he has a team around him. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3116.1800000000003s)]
*  Many of them were in that wilderness. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3119.6200000000003s)]
*  Second is disruption. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3123.9s)]
*  That if you look at what Elon Musk is doing and you think about how he succeeded and how [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3124.9s)]
*  he thinks, how did each of his big business successes came? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3134.06s)]
*  He was doing things that people said couldn't be done and he did it fast and in ways that [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3139.14s)]
*  drew a lot of criticism and that were ultimately successful. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3143.9799999999996s)]
*  You fuel that with the fact that the administration knows that a lot of what they're doing is [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3149.54s)]
*  net positive in the country. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3156.18s)]
*  Now, I think you and I would build a 30-day plan or measure twice and cut once. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3158.82s)]
*  There hasn't been a lot of that. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3164.5800000000004s)]
*  Somebody was saying to me last night, they're not measuring at all. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3167.0600000000004s)]
*  Someone in the Trump White House? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3173.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3175.5s)]
*  There's more and more recognition that the positive parts that come from innovation and [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3176.5s)]
*  efficiency aren't being seen. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3183.82s)]
*  Then the third is the president's great disruptions around the country and around the world. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3188.5s)]
*  Donald Trump, as you know, thinks very short-term, but there are people around him that are thinking [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3196.38s)]
*  in terms of centuries. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3201.46s)]
*  They're thinking if we make these big bets, we could rewire the US economy. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3203.58s)]
*  We could rewire the global economy. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3208.1s)]
*  We could rewire the world order. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3210.58s)]
*  They're trying to do them all at once. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3213.34s)]
*  That is the way they're thinking, and those are the bets that he's making. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3216.86s)]
*  I want to just follow up on the world order. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3221.2200000000003s)]
*  How do they want to rewire the world order? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3223.58s)]
*  To me, this is the most high-stakes aspect of what they're trying to do. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3225.54s)]
*  How would you describe what they want to do and who's driving that change? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3229.9s)]
*  What they want to do is the way that they would say it is to rebalance what's happening. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3234.58s)]
*  This ties in with the economy that they would say that America has been taken advantage [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3243.18s)]
*  of is the way that they phrase it. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3248.54s)]
*  They are trying to bring that back into ... When they use the phrase America first, they want [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3253.4199999999996s)]
*  you to think that that means we're thinking about America, not that every other place [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3264.5s)]
*  can go screw themselves. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3270.22s)]
*  That's the part where, again, this has been done so situationally that they haven't told [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3272.86s)]
*  a holistic story about where we wind up after all these simultaneous disruptions. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3279.9s)]
*  One of the things that I think happened during the first Trump administration is that ... I [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3289.1400000000003s)]
*  wrote many of these headlines myself at the New York Times on the Op-Ed page. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3294.26s)]
*  All of the language was used, fascist, racist, bigoted, xenophobic. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3299.18s)]
*  We could go on and on and on to the point where I feel that a lot of the language has [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3306.8199999999997s)]
*  been used up. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3312.98s)]
*  I wonder, we're all people that make our living with words and certain things are happening [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3315.62s)]
*  that are genuinely sui generis right now from this administration, that are genuinely pretty [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3323.66s)]
*  ... I'll just use the word wild. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3330.18s)]
*  It feels like I find it hard to describe what's happening without relying on words that have [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3333.8199999999997s)]
*  been used up, if that makes sense. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3342.1s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3345.2599999999998s)]
*  Were journalists irresponsible in the first Trump administration and are we reaping the [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3347.54s)]
*  whirlwind of that now? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3353.02s)]
*  There was certainly a lot of hyperbolic language and I do think it probably cheapened the strongest [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3355.3s)]
*  words that we have in the language to convey the seriousness of stuff. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3359.86s)]
*  This came up even a month and a half ago, early into the Trump term. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3364.22s)]
*  There were a lot of headlines where, in a constitutional crisis. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3370.54s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3374.58s)]
*  There's definitely a lot of actions he's taken that could and I think likely will result [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3375.58s)]
*  in a real showdown with the Supreme Court and the potential that the White House would [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3380.1s)]
*  defy a court ruling. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3384.66s)]
*  That would be a constitutional crisis. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3386.74s)]
*  We got to just be careful. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3389.66s)]
*  We talk about this all the time. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3391.3199999999997s)]
*  It's why you keep hearing us talk about hygiene or clinical. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3392.86s)]
*  Just trying to explain what's happening, trying to put it into some context and be able to [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3397.18s)]
*  show people how it's different than the way it was before. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3402.58s)]
*  One of the things when we talk to folks in the White House, a thing that Mike and I write [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3405.94s)]
*  a lot about in our columns is be careful with doing all this unprecedented stuff because [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3409.14s)]
*  you live in a 50-50 country where we saw with the recent results in Wisconsin and Florida [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3416.02s)]
*  where the likelihood of Congress flipping back soon is pretty high. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3421.7799999999997s)]
*  When you do something unprecedented and 30 years of covering this, I've never seen the [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3428.06s)]
*  other party not make that precedented and then normal. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3432.08s)]
*  They're going to use all of these techniques against you. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3436.2s)]
*  We're constantly trying to show people, listen, if you start to use the powers of the White [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3439.6s)]
*  House to punish lawyers or to bully media companies or to really stretch the use of [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3444.2s)]
*  the military in a way we haven't used it before, whatever that would be, just showing the dangers [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3452.4s)]
*  of it and pointing out that it hasn't been done before. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3457.6s)]
*  Here are the reasons it hasn't been done before and occasionally saying this is how [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3460.52s)]
*  it could be used in a more dramatic way. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3464.48s)]
*  I'm so sympathetic to the reader, the listener, the viewer. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3467.92s)]
*  It's just a lot. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3472.4s)]
*  I wish I could tell people, hey, everything's going to settle down. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3474.68s)]
*  It's not. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3477.44s)]
*  In the way that I think I keep my sanity and Mike keeps his sanity is that this might be [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3479.72s)]
*  the most intellectually invigorating period we'll ever live through because you have three [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3484.72s)]
*  tectonic shifts happening simultaneously. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3488.88s)]
*  You have this massive shift in American politics. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3492.04s)]
*  I would argue the advancement of AI towards AGI, artificial general intelligence, during [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3494.88s)]
*  this term could be bigger than the political shift. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3501.92s)]
*  And you put on top of that that we've changed fundamentally how people are getting their [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3506.36s)]
*  news and their information and therefore creating their reality. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3511.08s)]
*  All three of those plates are shifting in dramatic, once in a century ways, simultaneously. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3514.68s)]
*  So when people are like, oh, I'm overwhelmed, I'm like, you should be overwhelmed. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3521.24s)]
*  It's overwhelming. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3524.6s)]
*  I wish there was a way it wasn't. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3525.6s)]
*  For the people that are like, I can't wait for it to go back to normal, you're saying [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3527.12s)]
*  it's never going back to normal. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3530.2799999999997s)]
*  In fact, the speed of changes is only going to pick up as AI becomes widespread. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3531.52s)]
*  I feel like we've written about this and talked about it a lot because we've covered technology [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3536.6s)]
*  as much as we cover politics. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  I've seen no sign of volatility easing. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3543.3199999999997s)]
*  I've seen no sign of technology slowing. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3545.92s)]
*  I've seen no sign of politics normalizing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3549.0s)]
*  I think you just have to accept that we're in this era of high, high velocity change. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3551.44s)]
*  And there's two ways to do that. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3557.96s)]
*  I guess you could just duck and go live in the woods and that might be the most peaceful, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3559.52s)]
*  pleasant way to exist. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3563.2s)]
*  Or you can try to pay attention to this and try to understand it because it is fundamentally [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3564.92s)]
*  fascinating. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3569.64s)]
*  It's really, really an interesting time to be alive. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3570.68s)]
*  And I guess the tonic I use with my kids is like, listen, for all of the hysteria and [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3574.48s)]
*  the oh my God, America's dying, give me a break. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3581.12s)]
*  It's never been a better time to be alive. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3585.16s)]
*  It's never been a better time to be an American. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3586.7999999999997s)]
*  You've never had more freedom, more opportunity, more wealth creation, more energy under your [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3588.7599999999998s)]
*  feet, more protection on your shores than you have at this moment. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3593.7599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, for all of the craziness we see in the media and craziness we see on cable [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3598.44s)]
*  or on social media, most Americans are pretty damn normal. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3602.88s)]
*  And if you think about all the people you meet in a given year, I guarantee you 80 to [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3606.56s)]
*  90% of those people are normal. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3610.64s)]
*  You'd say they, whatever they shovel, they'd help you shovel in a snowstorm. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3613.2400000000002s)]
*  They would give money. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3616.08s)]
*  They, they volunteer. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3617.08s)]
*  They're fundamentally good people. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3618.08s)]
*  And that is still the heart and soul of this country. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3620.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it's probably a lot of your, your, your viewership, your, your readership. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3622.4s)]
*  And I have, I have such a undying fundamental faith in that part of America that we're [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3626.84s)]
*  going to figure it out. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3632.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it looks like. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3633.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think anyone knows what it's going to look like. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3634.2000000000003s)]
*  One of the things I want to go back to what you were saying, Mike, about the shards. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3638.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it's a really perfect metaphor that we used to have sort of one window or one [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3642.0s)]
*  mirror maybe looking at reality, reflecting it back to us. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3646.7200000000003s)]
*  And now each of us have shards. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3649.88s)]
*  I hear a lot of people, especially in an older generation, sort of longing for the Walter [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3653.5600000000004s)]
*  Cronkite era. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3658.1600000000003s)]
*  And they basically say, we all used to have one shared reality. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  We used to be able to trust him. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3665.32s)]
*  And the way that I tend to think about that is, yeah, maybe that was nice, but the reality [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3667.5600000000004s)]
*  is you had no idea if Walter Cronkite was trustworthy or not. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3671.76s)]
*  You had no way to check his work because he was the only game in town. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3675.6400000000003s)]
*  I would love for you to speak to it because, you know, on the one hand, there's something [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3680.24s)]
*  profoundly comforting about everyone tuning in, watching the same thing, having a shared [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3684.12s)]
*  reality. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3689.0s)]
*  On the other hand, we had no idea if it was actually true or not. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3690.0s)]
*  I mean, something that the three of us share and the reason that we've been able to build [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3693.2s)]
*  great organizations is we have no nostalgia for what's gone. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3697.48s)]
*  And that's not coming back. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3702.12s)]
*  We're not going to have that again. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3703.7599999999998s)]
*  And it does mean, as Jim said, that there is more information, more insight, more reality [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3705.84s)]
*  available to you than ever. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3714.28s)]
*  We can watch almost everything in real time. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3715.88s)]
*  But it also puts a burden on us as news consumers to be savvier about where we're picking up [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3719.04s)]
*  these different parts of our info soup, info stew, rather than being able to assume that [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3726.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever was coming through that mirror or window was accurate. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3734.04s)]
*  And something that Jim and I have done with our column on Axios, Behind the Curtain, has [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3738.72s)]
*  been to really delve into the different shards and show people the different realities that [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3744.64s)]
*  are existing. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3753.48s)]
*  In the first term, they talked about alternative facts. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3754.48s)]
*  What we have now is that whole realities are being created in MAGA media or in suburban [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3758.28s)]
*  Instagram media or whatever the different ways are that people are getting information, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3765.6800000000003s)]
*  the whole ultimate fighting world, the whole world of gaming. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3772.0400000000004s)]
*  They're in their own reality. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3779.48s)]
*  They're in their own world. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3782.0s)]
*  And that's not changing. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3783.52s)]
*  And so as journalists, as a media company, the best that we can do is help those sophisticated, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3785.16s)]
*  demanding information consumers understand what's happening there, give them the clinical [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3796.04s)]
*  like a doctor. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3802.68s)]
*  You're not going to get a Republican diagnosis or a Democratic diagnosis. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3803.68s)]
*  You're just going to get that diagnosis. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3807.48s)]
*  We'll bring it to you in an efficient, friendly way, all of which is distinctive, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3810.48s)]
*  which makes you vital, as Jim said, indispensable, useful. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3816.84s)]
*  That's a great place to be, and it's a great way to spend your life. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3821.12s)]
*  I feel very lucky that I've had the life experiences that I have and to have the chance [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3824.48s)]
*  to now illuminate, synthesize, uncover, expose what's happening now in a way that helps [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3830.0s)]
*  people make better decisions. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3838.32s)]
*  Like, that's an incredible privilege, and I feel very lucky. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3840.52s)]
*  I want you to take me behind the curtain of a few media companies that I think have been [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3842.92s)]
*  trying to pivot in the Trump era. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3847.48s)]
*  One of them is MSNBC, where Joy Reid was fired. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3850.2400000000002s)]
*  Alex Wagner was replaced by Jen Psaki in the 9 p.m. slot. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3854.92s)]
*  Good changes, bad changes, or is it just sort of managed decline over at MSNBC? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3859.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it depends what lens you're looking through. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3865.84s)]
*  I think for a business, if I'm MSNBC and I'm just looking at it as a businessman, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3869.76s)]
*  of course, yeah, that's what we're talking about. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3873.56s)]
*  Go all in on the resistance, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3875.08s)]
*  Like you trying to be a little bit of this, a little bit of that doesn't work. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3876.92s)]
*  I think if is there a market for people who are extremely liberal, who are tribal in their [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3880.6000000000004s)]
*  liberalism and who want their nightly dose of additional liberalism with their chardonnay? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3886.2000000000003s)]
*  There is. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3892.76s)]
*  And I think you probably can build a business model around it. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3893.48s)]
*  I'm saying like value neutral. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3896.84s)]
*  Like if you're running MSNBC, is Jen Psaki a better voice of the resistance than Joy Reid? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3898.36s)]
*  There was a lot of consternation about her being fired. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3904.88s)]
*  Yeah, again, like I don't know who they're going after, like who their people respond to. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3907.96s)]
*  They don't have a terribly big audience for most of their shows. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3912.72s)]
*  But as of now, there's enough cable providers and there's enough advertising dollars to [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3916.36s)]
*  support what seems like a pretty robust business. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3921.08s)]
*  Like long term, would I want to be a high paid network, on air personality and hope [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3923.48s)]
*  that that's the way I'm going to make money for the next 10 years? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3930.92s)]
*  I wouldn't. I'd much rather be on YouTube with a big following of younger people where [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3933.08s)]
*  I know that I can monetize it in a more cost efficient way. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3936.52s)]
*  But I think like if you're MSNBC and that's your asset, they're probably doing what you [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3939.96s)]
*  need to do to survive. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3943.4s)]
*  All right, let's go to a conservative company. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3944.36s)]
*  Take me behind the scenes. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3946.12s)]
*  Sarah Fisher had a story yesterday about Newsmax. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3947.24s)]
*  Notably, Newsmax appears in a story that I'm editing about Qatar and Qatari influence. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3951.64s)]
*  It took $50 million from Qatar and recently, this according to reporting from other people, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3956.68s)]
*  basically told its newsroom to kind of shy away from criticizing the small Middle Eastern [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3962.52s)]
*  petro states. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3968.2s)]
*  I find that interesting. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3968.9199999999996s)]
*  Anyway, this is a company that lost $55 million in the first half of 2024 as revenues of $80 [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3970.2s)]
*  million and was valued at $16 billion this week, its second day as a public company. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3976.76s)]
*  Explain that to me. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3983.8s)]
*  How does that make sense and where's Newsmax going? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3985.8s)]
*  Is Newsmax the ultimately going to be something like the New York Times for the MAGA, right? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3988.5200000000004s)]
*  Tell me about that for people and I'm one of them. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3994.44s)]
*  I'm not really a Newsmax. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3997.48s)]
*  I'm not the Newsmax audience. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=3999.2400000000002s)]
*  What is going on, Mike, in this alternative world for the people that inhabit a different [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4001.0800000000004s)]
*  shard? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4006.44s)]
*  What's happening in that one? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4006.84s)]
*  Mike McDonald Yeah, no, Jim and I have delved deep into the MAGA media world. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4007.96s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time in it, learning the players, learning how it works. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4013.88s)]
*  Newsmax is an essential piece of that. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4021.96s)]
*  Chris Reddy, a former journalist who built that business, I read that on paper yesterday, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4024.36s)]
*  he was worth $6 billion. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4030.68s)]
*  He's a regular at Mar-a-Lago. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4033.4s)]
*  You definitely have him pick up your check, right? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4034.84s)]
*  What Newsmax has done as part of that MAGA media ecosystem is there's two things that we [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4040.2000000000003s)]
*  have learned about it. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4047.96s)]
*  One is how self-beating, self-supporting it is that those MAGA cable channels, Newsmax [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4049.56s)]
*  at the head of the list, those podcasts, those social media influencers, they so reinforce [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4058.92s)]
*  each other. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4066.28s)]
*  I knew this intellectually, academically, and from disparate conversations, but very [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4068.12s)]
*  accurate, a new appreciation for this. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4075.56s)]
*  A couple days before Christmas, I went to Phoenix to Turning Points USA America Fest, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4077.8s)]
*  AmFest. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4083.8s)]
*  And I saw with my own eyes that Media Row, which at the conventions I've been going [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4085.0s)]
*  to all my life as a political reporter, Media Row was a couple of atriums in the Phoenix [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4095.1600000000003s)]
*  Convention Center, podcasts with massive stages. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4102.2s)]
*  They had teleprompters. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4106.4400000000005s)]
*  They were all on video. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4108.52s)]
*  And what I saw that was so illuminating, gets back to your thing about Newsmax, is [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4110.12s)]
*  they were all going on each other's sets, each other's shows. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4115.64s)]
*  That's become both a tremendous strength for this president and it sets up how Trumpism [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4121.48s)]
*  could outlive Trump. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4129.0s)]
*  And Newsmax would definitely be one of the platforms for that. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4130.76s)]
*  And Chris Reddy, looking at the stock price today, he should probably spend his money [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4135.4s)]
*  fast. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4140.92s)]
*  People called the 2024 election the podcast election. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4142.28s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there who feel that without Elon Musk making a number of [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4148.04s)]
*  important podcast appearances and taking his show on the road, and also Joe Rogan having [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4153.96s)]
*  Trump on and endorsing him, that Trump might not have won the election but for those [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4159.5599999999995s)]
*  phenomenon. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4164.28s)]
*  What do you guys make of that? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4164.84s)]
*  Was it the podcast election? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4166.12s)]
*  Are all elections going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, going to be podcast [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4167.88s)]
*  elections, Jim? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4172.36s)]
*  I don't know if I'd use the term podcast election, but no doubt what you said is true. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4173.8s)]
*  I think one of the most important things that happened last year and it happened early last [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4177.8s)]
*  year and intensified by election day was this fusing of what I would call the bro industrial [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4181.48s)]
*  complex and MAGA. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4186.44s)]
*  And the bro industrial complex would be a mix of people out on the West Coast who are [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4188.2s)]
*  Silicon Valley tycoons with a lot of these podcasters, kind of a mix of the ultimate [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4192.76s)]
*  fighting, longevity, they kind of all go on each other's shows. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4199.08s)]
*  They all fused together with MAGA throughout the year and that really gave Trump credibility [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4203.64s)]
*  on the West Coast. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4209.4800000000005s)]
*  It gave him credibility with a lot of donors and entrepreneurs and it really opened the [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4210.76s)]
*  floodgate I think to a lot of talent coming into this White House. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4215.24s)]
*  But in an election that was so narrow, like we think of it as like a landslide, it was [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4219.08s)]
*  actually quite a narrow victory in terms of raw numbers. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4223.0s)]
*  There's no doubt that made a huge difference. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4227.24s)]
*  And I think it opened the public's eye to the fact that someone like Joe Rogan, who [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4230.04s)]
*  I've listened to for many, many years, but if you just break down his following, if he [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4233.48s)]
*  has 16 million people listening to his podcast and then tens of millions more getting derivative [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4237.88s)]
*  pieces of that on X, on YouTube, on Instagram, and other platforms, you realize that this [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4243.08s)]
*  one man with a small band has more reach than many networks do. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4249.72s)]
*  And I think that's a new reality. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4254.44s)]
*  There's just going to be a lot of different players of different sizes. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4255.8s)]
*  You could be a one-person operation. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4258.76s)]
*  You could be a relatively small podcast. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4260.6s)]
*  You could be a big growing business like Axios, a newer thriving business like your company. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4262.6s)]
*  And you're just going to have a wild collection of those. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4268.92s)]
*  And I think the lesson for Democrats should be like, stop talking in your bubble, like [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4271.32s)]
*  go out and be fearless enough to have conversations with people who don't share your views. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4277.96s)]
*  Stop blacklisting programs because they had someone on that said something that offended [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4282.92s)]
*  someone's sensibility at one time. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4287.16s)]
*  This is a moment of massive change in America. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4289.48s)]
*  I think a lot of voting blocks are up for grabs. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4293.0s)]
*  Hispanics, African Americans, you name it, are up for grabs. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4295.16s)]
*  And I think they're persuadable. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4298.759999999999s)]
*  But to get to them, you might need to go on TikTok. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4300.2s)]
*  You might need to go on Joe Rogan. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4302.76s)]
*  You might need to go on Posse of America. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4304.36s)]
*  Just do it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4307.08s)]
*  Well, you mentioned the marriage of the sort of Silicon Valley bros, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4308.44s)]
*  techno-optimists, center-right crowd, libertarian crowd to MAGA. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4313.639999999999s)]
*  And that's kind of a perfect segue to Elon Musk. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4317.72s)]
*  Jim, Elon Musk has been telling people on Twitter, now called X, I sort of refuse to call it X, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4321.4s)]
*  that they are the media. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4327.48s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4329.4s)]
*  It's a variation of a theme. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4329.64s)]
*  He also says Vox Populi, Vox Dei, the voice of the people is the voice of God. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4331.160000000001s)]
*  And you responded to him in, well, you'll give me the context, but it was some kind of speech. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4336.04s)]
*  It seemed like you were speaking off the cuff. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4342.12s)]
*  It was very passionate. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4344.04s)]
*  And you talked about how his claim that we are the media is bullshit. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4345.4800000000005s)]
*  Tell people who didn't pay attention to that exchange, I was fascinated by it, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4350.84s)]
*  what that dispute was really about. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4356.6s)]
*  Because I actually think it's an argument you're making about where media is going. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4357.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4364.36s)]
*  Just for context, for people listening, it was a speech to the National Press Foundation. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4365.24s)]
*  A bunch of young, struggling, smaller newspapers had spoken before talking about the struggles [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4370.28s)]
*  of operating a newspaper. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4376.36s)]
*  Nowadays, the economics of it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4378.6s)]
*  And so I gave a speech, a little bit trying to fire them up, about this idea that reporting [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4380.2s)]
*  matters. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4386.52s)]
*  And where I agree with Elon is that, yes, you have arguably the most powerful media platform [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4387.400000000001s)]
*  in America today. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4394.92s)]
*  And there are a lot of voices participating on your platform. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4396.120000000001s)]
*  But that is fundamentally different than reporting. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4400.4400000000005s)]
*  And so if you're trying to equate somebody who just happens to have 200 characters and [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4403.96s)]
*  a pithy opinion with somebody who's trying to do deep reporting, trying to get to the [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4408.280000000001s)]
*  closest approximation of the truth, I feel like you're doing a disservice. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4412.120000000001s)]
*  They're two totally different things. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4416.2s)]
*  I think I used the analogy on that speech. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4418.28s)]
*  Like, listen, just because I can look at your head and I have a drill, doesn't make me a [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4420.92s)]
*  brain surgeon. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4423.88s)]
*  Like there's actually a set of skills you need to be able to operate on someone's temple. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4425.4s)]
*  And I believe in that. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4431.0s)]
*  And again, there's probably people listening to this who don't see any difference to it. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4432.28s)]
*  But I would beg you to look back at the history of this country and the amount of good that [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4436.28s)]
*  having a free press has done to uncover ills in society, to right wrongs, to expose corruption, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4442.04s)]
*  to reset things, to illuminate things so that we can fundamentally have a country that's [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4450.6s)]
*  vastly different than others. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4456.04s)]
*  We should proudly feel like we are a superior country. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4457.16s)]
*  I do. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4459.72s)]
*  I happen to think America's a lot better than any other country. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4460.28s)]
*  And I happen to think that a free press sits at the heart of that. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4462.76s)]
*  And I think I've dedicated my life. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4466.36s)]
*  You've dedicated your life, right? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4468.2s)]
*  Like we've taken extraordinary risks. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4469.56s)]
*  And I'm not asking anyone to slap you on the back or us on the back. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4471.56s)]
*  We've taken extraordinary risks because we believe so passionately in that that we wanted [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4474.360000000001s)]
*  to create viable, durable, scalable entities that can spread truth based on very shared [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4479.4800000000005s)]
*  principles. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4485.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think your principles are that different from my principles. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4485.88s)]
*  They're probably in many ways identical. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4488.6s)]
*  And I will go to my grave fighting that good fight. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4492.84s)]
*  One of the things that makes this country great is that someone like me who did not [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4496.28s)]
*  know what ROI was literally when I started this business certainly did not know what [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4502.04s)]
*  EBITDA or TAM or all of these like weird acronyms were that I can start a business here. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4507.0s)]
*  And you know that we have the incredible freedom to do that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4512.84s)]
*  As we discussed earlier, you guys set up Axios in 2017. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4516.2s)]
*  I kind of can't even remember a world without Axios to be honest with you. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4521.0s)]
*  And tell us where you are today. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4524.12s)]
*  How big is Axios? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4528.2s)]
*  How many people do you reach? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4529.88s)]
*  So as a company, we probably have about 500 and some employees. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4532.12s)]
*  We have Axios National and then we're in 34 cities, which a lot of people don't know. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4535.48s)]
*  We have Axios for Axios and in a lot of local communities from Seattle down to Miami and [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4539.4s)]
*  Boston over to San Diego. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4544.28s)]
*  And we send out 4 million newsletters a day to 4 million different people. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4546.92s)]
*  How many newsletters? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4555.240000000001s)]
*  How many newsletters a day? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4557.72s)]
*  We have 34 local that go out plus another probably 25 to 30 national. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4558.76s)]
*  So we have a lot. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4565.64s)]
*  A lot of those are micro. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4566.360000000001s)]
*  Might be cybersecurity or energy. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4567.400000000001s)]
*  They're things that wouldn't be for a general audience, but they're written by experts, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4569.64s)]
*  for experts and written in the same clinical tone. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4573.400000000001s)]
*  And then we have tens of millions of people that interact with us either coming directly [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4576.92s)]
*  to the site or finding us on social media. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4580.52s)]
*  And unlike your business, we're mostly ad driven. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4583.56s)]
*  We have some higher end subscription products that's an increasing part of our business, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4587.0s)]
*  but we still do a lot of money from advertising and people advertise on us differently than [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4591.08s)]
*  they might on say the New York Times. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4596.200000000001s)]
*  For us, you're really trying to reach this elite audience of business, political, tech [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4598.6s)]
*  and media leaders. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4603.160000000001s)]
*  And the example I use is that Coca-Cola wouldn't come to us to sell a can of Coke, but they [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4604.52s)]
*  might advertise to explain to people in positions of power the good that they do or their business [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4608.76s)]
*  model or why they're the best place to work. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4613.88s)]
*  And that's that that is like the bread and butter of our business. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4616.200000000001s)]
*  We also do probably 200 live events, live journalism around everything from AI to politics [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4619.64s)]
*  to health care. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4627.56s)]
*  One of the things I'm really interested in, because I'm trying to do it in my own small [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4628.84s)]
*  way, is that in a moment where, as we've been talking about, people don't trust institutions, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4632.84s)]
*  they trust influencers, they trust very specific personalities and kind of follow them around [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4638.12s)]
*  on the Internet, you guys have built an institution that yes, is associated with Mike, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4645.08s)]
*  certainly and you, Jim, but also a lot of other people. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4649.88s)]
*  How have you managed to create an institution that is bigger than individual people in an [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4653.56s)]
*  era where, and Yuval Levin has talked on this podcast about this at length and written about [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4660.6s)]
*  it, I think more cogently than anyone else, people talent is increasingly using institutions [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4665.240000000001s)]
*  as sort of a jumping off platform to then go independent. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4671.240000000001s)]
*  But I feel like Axios, yeah, you've lost some great people to places like the New York Times, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4674.280000000001s)]
*  but generally it seems like you've attracted institutionalists in the people that want to [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4678.360000000001s)]
*  work for you. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4683.400000000001s)]
*  How have you done it? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4683.96s)]
*  Give me advice and give advice to anyone listening that is trying to build something [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4684.84s)]
*  where the mission is bigger than individual talent or individual egos. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4689.96s)]
*  Jim Higgins I think you nailed it. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4694.28s)]
*  Make the mission bigger than you. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4696.36s)]
*  Don't make it about you. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4698.92s)]
*  It's about, for us, it's how do we help people get smarter faster on topics that matter. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4700.04s)]
*  I think we're really good now at spotting talent, but that's 20 years of trial and error. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4704.44s)]
*  I think now we're really good at figuring out who has the DNA that we've talked about [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4708.36s)]
*  throughout this show. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4712.04s)]
*  And then we treat them well. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4713.0s)]
*  We try to get them whatever they want, whether it's money or whether it's being on stage or [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4714.28s)]
*  being on TV or whatever it is that they need to feel psychically motivated. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4718.44s)]
*  We want to be the best place to work. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4722.759999999999s)]
*  And I think we're fundamentally really good human beings. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think anyone's ever heard Mike or me raise our voice. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4728.04s)]
*  We're tough. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4730.759999999999s)]
*  We're demanding. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4731.32s)]
*  But I would say we work harder than we ask anyone else to work. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4732.5199999999995s)]
*  All the things that you do, right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4735.799999999999s)]
*  I think this is true across any business. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4737.639999999999s)]
*  If you're a good person, you care about what you're doing, you have a set of values, you [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4739.879999999999s)]
*  live out those values, you're authentic. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4744.679999999999s)]
*  When you screw up, you admit that you screwed up. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4747.56s)]
*  People will follow you and they'll stay with you. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4749.88s)]
*  And I would hope that that would be the reason that people come to us and stay with us. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4751.8s)]
*  I hope they would say we're like good leaders who we're not spinning BS. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4756.120000000001s)]
*  This is like what we believe and this is how we live. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4759.72s)]
*  And very in this moment, like one way that our whole team is energized is like we have [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4762.360000000001s)]
*  never felt the sense of mission and purpose more viscerally. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4769.56s)]
*  So Jim and I have been at this 18 years as entrepreneurs after he walked out of [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4775.4s)]
*  The Washington Post, I walked out of Time Magazine, Roy Schwartz has joined us as a [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4782.28s)]
*  co-founder of Axios, and Barry is kind of sad, but I've written a morning newsletter [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4786.92s)]
*  every morning, 365 days a year for 18 years now, 10 years, Playbook at Politico and now [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4794.679999999999s)]
*  Axios AM. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4801.96s)]
*  And of those 18 years, I'm convinced you're an AI. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4803.56s)]
*  That's absolutely insane. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4807.64s)]
*  Jim and I have never felt more passionately the need to bring to difference makers, decision [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4811.240000000001s)]
*  makers, the reporting of the great reporters we've been talking about here who work across [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4818.200000000001s)]
*  Axios and across the company to bring distinctive, clinical, efficient, illuminating reporting. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4823.88s)]
*  So that people can make better decisions and have better lives and that makes a better [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4833.16s)]
*  country and a better world. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4837.32s)]
*  And we feel like in these times, like even very sophisticated, savvy, wired, plugged in [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4839.72s)]
*  people between AI and Trump, they're like, help me navigate this, like explain this, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4847.639999999999s)]
*  show me how to think about this. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's what Axios can do and that's why Jim and I are up at four and we're here at [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4858.44s)]
*  Axios HQ in Arlington, Virginia and excited to be here. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  I've never been more fired up. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4869.08s)]
*  Every single morning, I bound out of bed, I don't have an alarm, I wake up and I am [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4871.4s)]
*  excited to be and we're very lucky that we have 499 other people. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4879.4s)]
*  Mike, what drugs are you on? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4883.32s)]
*  What drugs are you on, Mike? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4884.919999999999s)]
*  I'm not passionate. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4886.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4888.2s)]
*  Are you ready for a lightning round? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4888.679999999999s)]
*  In. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4891.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4892.04s)]
*  Mike, as you have just explained to our listeners, you are a famous workaholic in an industry [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4893.0s)]
*  dominated by them. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4899.32s)]
*  No, that's not true anymore because now I have my aura ring and it gives me great visibility [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4900.2s)]
*  and awareness. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4906.36s)]
*  Okay, let's start with that. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CLU25_36s&t=4907.16s)]
