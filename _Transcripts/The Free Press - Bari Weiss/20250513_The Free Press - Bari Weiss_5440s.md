The majority of people listening to this episode are hearing it on an iPhone. As most of us can attest, the iPhone is so central to our lives that if we lose it, we feel totally unmoored from our ability to function in the world.

It’s hard to explain how ubiquitous the iPhone is—and how much of a behemoth Apple is. Apple sells over 60 million iPhones in the U.S. a year, and one plant can make as many as 500,000 iPhones per day. And in 2024, the company brought in a total revenue of $391 billion.

The rise of Apple and the iPhone did not happen by accident. The fact that we all walk around with the most sophisticated technology in our pockets—at a cost of about a thousand dollars each—is the result of two forces: Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and China, our largest geostrategic and economic rival.

Few people are more prepared to discuss the symbiotic relationship between Apple and Communist China than Patrick McGee, a longtime business journalist who has covered Apple for the Financial Times. McGee is the author of Apple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Company.

And Patrick makes the case that Apple became the world’s most valuable company by wedding itself—and its future—to an authoritarian state. As the president and others talk about decoupling from the country, Apple’s exposure in China isn’t just a liability for the company—it’s a liability to our national security, our own workforce, and our future.

# How Apple Sold Its Soul to an Authoritarian Regime
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=0.0s)]

*  to our lives that when we lose it, we can feel totally unmoored from our ability to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=14.4s)]
*  function normally in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=19.62s)]
*  Or maybe that's just me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=21.3s)]
*  It's hard to explain how ubiquitous the iPhone is and how much of a behemoth Apple is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=23.3s)]
*  The company that manufactures the iPhone sells over 60 million iPhones in the U.S. a year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=30.080000000000002s)]

*  The fact that we all walk around with the most sophisticated technology in our pockets [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=54.34s)]
*  for about $2,000, sometimes even less, is the result of two forces. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=58.7s)]
*  The current CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, and America's largest geostrategic and economic rival, China. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=63.86s)]
*  Few people are better prepared to discuss the symbiotic relationship between Apple and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  China than Patrick McGee. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=76.58s)]
*  A longtime business journalist who has covered Apple for the Financial Times, McGee is the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=79.14s)]
*  author of Apple in China, the capture of the world's greatest company, which hits bookstores today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=84.14s)]
*  McGee makes the case that Apple became the world's most valuable company by wetting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=91.1s)]
*  itself and its future to an authoritarian state. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=95.78s)]
*  As the president and others talk about decoupling from China, Apple's exposure isn't just a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=100.22s)]
*  liability for the company. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=105.82s)]
*  It's a liability, he argues, to our national security, our own workforce, and our future. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=107.78s)]
*  Today on Honestly, I asked Patrick how China came to dominate Apple's manufacturing supply [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=114.02s)]
*  chain, how its totalitarian political system and labor practices lured Apple in, and how [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=120.22s)]
*  Apple's decades-long transfer of knowledge and capital into China has made it nearly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=127.22s)]
*  impossible to leave. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=132.62s)]
*  And why the conventional wisdom, which is that Apple would not exist in its current [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=134.38s)]
*  form but for China, actually works the other way around. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=138.62s)]
*  As Patrick argues, China would not be China without Apple. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=142.7s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=148.06s)]
*  Patrick McGee, welcome to Honestly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=154.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=156.82s)]
*  Okay, so the majority of people who are listening to this conversation right now are listening [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=157.82s)]
*  on an iPhone. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=162.86s)]
*  Some 155 million Americans have an iPhone, a number that kind of blew my mind, and you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=164.62s)]
*  make the case that those numbers never would have happened had it not been for China. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=170.3s)]
*  Oh, unquestionably. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=175.74s)]
*  I don't even know what the counterargument of that would be. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=176.74s)]
*  Well, make that argument. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, where my book gets novel is that, like, I think it's fairly straightforward [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=181.18s)]
*  that China is the only place on the planet that has the tech competence in terms of manufacturing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=186.78000000000003s)]
*  capability, certainly the price, the cost, the quantity, the scale. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=191.22s)]
*  My novel argument is that it has those skills because Apple built them there, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=195.54s)]
*  It's not that China offered something to Apple that like Apple didn't find these skills in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=200.5s)]
*  China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=206.1s)]
*  It shipped people over by the plane load and created them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=207.1s)]
*  And so it's this another layer of nuance that Apple is dependent on the very capabilities [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=210.2s)]
*  that it created. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=214.86s)]
*  And I think this is like the biggest untold story in tech over the last 25 years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=217.34s)]
*  And like my jaw was on the floor as I talked to 200 people and sort of unraveled it all. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=221.18s)]
*  But I mean, some of the numbers, like any time you're dealing with Apple, the numbers [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=225.22000000000003s)]
*  are just crazy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=228.02s)]
*  And so the two numbers that really stick out at me are that the number of people they have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  trained in China since 2008 is 28 million. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=234.86s)]
*  Okay, so that's larger than the labor force of California. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  And the investments they were making in China by 2015 were $55 billion a year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=241.1s)]
*  And that's such a large number that I couldn't find any corporate equivalent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=247.26s)]
*  So I had to go to nation building efforts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  And I took the Marshall Plan, the most famous nation building effort ever, converted it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=253.62s)]
*  to $2015. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=258.54s)]
*  And you realize that Apple is investing in China twice that of the annual spend of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=260.24s)]
*  Marshall Plan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=264.62s)]
*  And Marshall Plan is for 16 countries. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=266.06s)]
*  The Cook Plan, if you will, reference to Tim Cook there, is in one country, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=268.22s)]
*  And it's obviously the chief adversary of the US. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=272.5s)]
*  So once I started putting those things together, it was like, oh my God, there was a remarkable [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  story here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  Given the numbers that I've just put out there in terms of the penetration of Apple's key [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  product in the American marketplace, and the numbers that you put forward in your incredible [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  which shows the extent to which Tim Cook and Apple have invested in China and arguably [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=293.54s)]
*  transformed it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=300.18s)]
*  You'll make that case, I hope, in this conversation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=301.18s)]
*  Why is it a story that has been so sort of undercover? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=303.86s)]
*  There's so much to unpack there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  And I've got sort of several answers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=309.5s)]
*  So one answer is just that COVID made supply chains and the resilience of supply chains, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  or rather the fragility of supply chains, sort of a headline, like a front page story [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=319.18s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=323.02s)]
*  And so I think before that happened, supply chains were just sort of considered boring. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=324.82s)]
*  They might be like the nervous system of globalization. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=331.66s)]
*  But if I said, I've got a great supply chain story for you, you've already lost interest. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=335.42s)]
*  If I've got a sexy Apple story for you, you probably are interested. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=339.62s)]
*  It's such a sexy, iconic company. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=342.98s)]
*  So COVID sort of helped in that regard. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=344.9s)]
*  I guess the other thing is just that because we don't manufacture very much, I mean, if [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=347.22s)]
*  you're a tech reporter in Silicon Valley, you're not really covering manufacturing, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=350.66s)]
*  I mean, all the other big giants, maybe Tesla excluded, are doing some form of digital advertising [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  or in the case of Amazon, logistics. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=360.42s)]
*  But they're not doing manufacturing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=363.18s)]
*  I mean, Apple is really unique in being a hardware company. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=364.18s)]
*  And the whole story is in China. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=367.3s)]
*  And there's two problems with China. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=369.14s)]
*  One is that it's a censored media landscape. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=370.5s)]
*  So there's really not any original reporting that's truly groundbreaking coming out of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  country because they can't really report on it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=376.74s)]
*  And all the Apple people that were orchestrating these events the last quarter century are [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=380.18s)]
*  under NDA, so they don't want to talk. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=385.74s)]
*  So the distance of time, if you will, really allowed me to get into the story because some [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=388.3s)]
*  of the biggest like the political awakening that Apple has is in 2013. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=394.26s)]
*  Well, you couldn't have really told that story then because all the key players involved [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=398.74s)]
*  were wedded to their jobs and actually doing, you know, performing the actions. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=402.1s)]
*  It's only a decade after the fact that they've sort of moved on and they can talk about it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=405.98s)]
*  and they have some distance and so forth. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=409.7s)]
*  So I think there's several answers and I hope I've pointed to a few. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=411.38s)]
*  But I would say that especially when I was pitching the book two years ago, I mean, the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=415.86s)]
*  biggest mystery to me was why hasn't this book already been written? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=420.58s)]
*  Because it's not a brilliant idea. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=423.94s)]
*  Did any I mean, did anyone try to write it as far as you know? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=425.54s)]
*  No. Well, OK, there's one other. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=429.02s)]
*  So Wayne Ma at the information I know was pitching basically a similar what sounds to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=431.82s)]
*  be a similar book at around the same time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  And I wish he had also gotten a book deal. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=439.97999999999996s)]
*  My understanding is that my book deal sort of killed his. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=442.46s)]
*  And that's really unfortunate because he's a great reporter. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=446.02s)]
*  And I would have loved to see what he did with the same topic. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=448.17999999999995s)]
*  And he's based in Asia. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=450.94s)]
*  And I'm sure he would have had different things and maybe would have cannibalized each [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=452.46s)]
*  other's sales, maybe would have heightened each other's sales. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  But he at least had the same idea and he's done some great reporting. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=458.9s)]
*  Oh, Patrick, let's go back in time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=461.7s)]
*  Because I want to explain for the listener who just broadly knows, OK, Apple, you know, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=463.82s)]
*  they make their products in China, but they didn't always write and your book sort of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  traces the evolution of how China became the place for Apple. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=473.94s)]
*  I want you to tell the story of how it goes from products being manufactured in places [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=478.9s)]
*  like Ireland and even California to Asia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  So the traditional narrative is that Steve Jobs comes back from his 12 year exile in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=487.74s)]
*  1997. He realizes that there needs to be something done differently about manufacturing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=492.74s)]
*  He hires Tim Cook and Tim Cook outsources everything to Asia and closes the factories. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=498.54s)]
*  That's really simplistic. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  It's more like a seven year narrative beginning when. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  So before Steve Jobs comes back in 1996, Apple has its worst year ever. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=509.66s)]
*  And it really is on the brink of bankruptcy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  So I think I reveal for the first time that they actually hired a chapter 11 lawyer and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=517.06s)]
*  they were days away from making payroll. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=521.66s)]
*  And I really try to emphasize that, especially because younger people who only know Apple [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=523.8599999999999s)]
*  is the dominant company. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=528.02s)]
*  I think we need a better understanding of just how close this company came to never [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=529.3399999999999s)]
*  existing or not never existing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=533.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. But, you know, to never becoming what we take for granted today. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=534.6199999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, Apple's founded in 1976 by two guys named Steve in a garage. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=539.14s)]
*  Globalization, at least for the electronics industry, basically doesn't exist at that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=543.5s)]
*  stage. I mean, that's the mainframe era. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=546.82s)]
*  And so you just think about like how big a computer is. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=549.34s)]
*  Right. It's like the size of a garage. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  It was never going to make any sense to build those in Asia and then ship them over the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=553.46s)]
*  seas, let alone in an airplane to get them to people. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=556.9s)]
*  Right. So so much happens in the 80s and 90s that ends up really hurting Apple because [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=559.4200000000001s)]
*  the PC first made by IBM and then cloned by everybody else. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=565.14s)]
*  Those are the companies that they're not fighting on all the things Steve Jobs cares [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=568.98s)]
*  about, like usability and like the graphical user interface and stuff. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  They're fighting over things that he would have thought of as mundane and boring. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=576.34s)]
*  Frankly, stuff that you and I would think of as mundane and boring. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=579.98s)]
*  Distribution, logistics, etc. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=582.54s)]
*  They're not fighting over software. They're all using Windows. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=584.14s)]
*  They're not fighting over chips. They're all using Intel. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=586.22s)]
*  And so their whole fight between IBM, PC, sorry, IBM, Gateway, Compaq, Dell, it's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=588.34s)]
*  all just about this boring stuff. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=597.42s)]
*  And Apple is really struggling to compete with them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=599.5s)]
*  And so even though arguably Apple has a better product in the throughout the 80s and the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=603.86s)]
*  90s, it's nearly bankrupt because it can't compete on price and manufacturability of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=608.26s)]
*  all these others. So it's really that it's near bankruptcy that it has to adopt a global [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=612.3399999999999s)]
*  outsourcing strategy. But that happens before Steve Jobs comes back, which is interesting. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  So he accelerates it and he has Tim Cook come in, who's this like 12 year veteran of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=621.3s)]
*  IBM. So he knows just in time production and that sort of stuff really well. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=625.18s)]
*  And China is not the answer at this stage. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=630.38s)]
*  It hasn't entered the World Trade Organization. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=633.3s)]
*  And so like the translucent candy colored iMac, that's built in Korea. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=635.3399999999999s)]
*  And then people don't really know that Apple sort of has them expand and they build it [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=639.14s)]
*  in Wales and they build it in Mexicali. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=643.78s)]
*  And then we have Foxconn coming on board and Foxconn is really the one that paves the way [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=646.8599999999999s)]
*  for China. But again, they're still in this experimentation stage where Foxconn is also [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=650.26s)]
*  building in the Czech Republic and they're building in Fullerton, California. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=654.46s)]
*  When does China sort of lock in as the main place? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  So China, like the first candy colored iMacs made in China roll off the assembly lines [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=662.3000000000001s)]
*  in 2000. The first iPods are still being built in Taiwan. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  So iPods are 2001 and they're made in Taiwan for several years by a company called [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=670.26s)]
*  Inventek. And then China just begins to just win out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=674.62s)]
*  So like once China enters the WTO, basically what that allows them to do. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=678.82s)]
*  In what year? Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=683.98s)]
*  2001. So same year. I mean, literally within two months of the iPod going on sale. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=685.82s)]
*  Right. So there's this like great meeting of the moment between Apple's needs for scale [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=689.62s)]
*  and China's ability to accept that scale. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=693.7s)]
*  And so what ends up happening is they've actually consolidated most of their [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=697.5s)]
*  production to Taiwan at this stage. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=702.7s)]
*  And Apple begins to be ludicrously successful with the iPod after two years of it [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=705.46s)]
*  actually kind of failing. And Taiwan is just too small. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  So I have these chapters in the book where they're trying to build iPods and they're [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=713.62s)]
*  trying to build the sunflower iMac. You might remember it sort of looks anthropomorphic [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=716.22s)]
*  like a Pixar lamp. It's really sexy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=719.5s)]
*  And my God, is it a complicated product to build? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=721.7s)]
*  And so Apple's trying to do it in Taiwan, but with the help of Singapore, Japan, you [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=724.14s)]
*  know, basically all of Southeast Asia, including China. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=728.5400000000001s)]
*  But the more you're doing things a little bit in China and comparing the cost, the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=730.98s)]
*  flexible demand of labor and just the armies of affordable labor, the more it looks [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=734.62s)]
*  like China is the way to go. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=739.74s)]
*  And they just rapidly begin to consolidate in 2003. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=741.58s)]
*  So the sort of fun line I have is that in 1999, zero products from Apple are being [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=744.78s)]
*  made in China. By 2009, virtually all of them are. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=749.46s)]
*  And that transition, I compare to a geopolitical event like the fall of the Berlin [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=752.86s)]
*  Wall. But it took place over many years and it's one that I don't think we've really [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=756.46s)]
*  grappled with or understood. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=760.22s)]
*  I love that Berlin Wall line. I want to get to it in a bit. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=761.78s)]
*  Before we do, I want you to explain to people because I think it's just really [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  interesting the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook, because Steve Jobs [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=768.1s)]
*  is sort of like the great innovator. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  Tim Cook, who is frankly far less interesting, I think, to the average person, is [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=776.78s)]
*  like the great distributor. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=781.62s)]
*  Tell us about how they worked with one another. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=783.46s)]
*  Give us a little more color on on their relationship. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=785.78s)]
*  Yeah. So Steve Jobs makes Apple products unique. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=788.02s)]
*  Tim Cook makes them ubiquitous. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=790.46s)]
*  That's the key kind of difference. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  They're similar in that they have like zero tolerance for defects. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=794.02s)]
*  They're real perfectionists. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=797.98s)]
*  But it's really interesting being able to speak with Apple executives who worked with [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=799.3s)]
*  both. So I quote someone saying it's really tough to work with Steve Jobs because [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=802.38s)]
*  emotionally he could go from zero to 100 in a matter of seconds. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=805.8199999999999s)]
*  Tim Cook would go from 35 to 36. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=809.3s)]
*  Right. And somehow that was actually more disconcerting because it's so different. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=812.5s)]
*  And you never really know where you stood with him. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=817.1s)]
*  So he would hold these meetings like the first meeting he held with all his worldwide [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=819.1s)]
*  managers ran for 13 hours. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=822.62s)]
*  And it's because he just goes after this like level of minutiae that he expects [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=824.9000000000001s)]
*  everybody in the organization to understand and go through. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=829.34s)]
*  So, for instance, like when he first held these meetings, some of the people had [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=832.62s)]
*  glasses, some of them didn't. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=836.0200000000001s)]
*  After a few years, everybody that reported to Tim Cook had glasses. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=837.1s)]
*  And it's because they were just going through Excel documents, you know, hour after [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=840.1s)]
*  hour, looking at every product, every region, you know, down multiple levels of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  detail. And when I talked to people who would submit, you know, let's say a 40 [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=847.14s)]
*  page report, like he would zoom in on like page 32, go to some footnote and want to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=850.1400000000001s)]
*  talk in more detail about that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=854.1s)]
*  So he's just like ridiculously detail oriented, but he's not detail oriented [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=855.5400000000001s)]
*  about the product. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=860.66s)]
*  Certainly not the product design. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=861.9s)]
*  That's somebody else. He's detailed about the operational efficiencies and sort of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=863.34s)]
*  squeezing every last penny out of something. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=868.22s)]
*  So, you know, if there's a rivet costing fractions of a penny, but you're doing [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  200 million of them, that adds up and nobody knows that more than Tim Cook. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=874.5s)]
*  If Tim Cook had not been in the picture, would this story have happened the way [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=877.82s)]
*  that it did? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=881.78s)]
*  I would actually advocate that he would I would say he should not have been made [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=882.54s)]
*  CEO in 2011. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=886.34s)]
*  Now, to some extent, that sounds like an insane thing to say, because when Apple [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=888.3s)]
*  became worth three trillion dollars in 2022, I stunned myself at 3 a.m. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=891.78s)]
*  doing the math, realizing that from the time he took over in 2011 to 2022, Apple's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=897.42s)]
*  market value had gone up 700 million dollars per day. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=902.54s)]
*  Right. Like, doesn't that sound like I'm obviously off by an order or two of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=906.34s)]
*  magnitude? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=909.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=909.98s)]
*  And it's not. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=910.46s)]
*  And people thought I was wrong. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=911.58s)]
*  They said so in the comments. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=912.74s)]
*  They said so on social media. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=913.62s)]
*  And I just had them do the math until until they realized it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=914.58s)]
*  Well, we just don't understand how big things are. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=916.7s)]
*  Whenever you're talking about Apple, you have to give analogies, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=918.46s)]
*  Because otherwise people just like their eyes glaze over when you say billion this [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=920.7s)]
*  trillion that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=923.82s)]
*  So how can you make the argument that Tim Cook should never become CEO given? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=927.98s)]
*  I don't think Tim Cook was ever going to go. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=931.38s)]
*  He loves Apple. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=933.02s)]
*  And so I think the operational efficiencies that he was already giving Apple, he was [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=934.66s)]
*  going to stay with them and give them and give them to Apple anyway. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=938.98s)]
*  In other words, I don't know what benefit you derive. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=941.78s)]
*  Why do you think Steve Jobs chose him? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, so no, that's interesting. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=946.46s)]
*  So because I think Steve Jobs realized that the products he conceived or, you know, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=947.58s)]
*  that he sort of oversaw the conception of, they were there to stay and that you needed [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=953.78s)]
*  someone with the day to day operational knowledge to scale them globally. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=960.58s)]
*  And nobody could do that better than Tim Cook. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=965.14s)]
*  My point is Tim Cook would have done that anyway. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=967.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, it's not you didn't need to give him the CEO title. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=969.62s)]
*  Correct. I mean, that's what that's my that's my argument. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=971.7s)]
*  I don't make that argument in the book, but that's how I feel about it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=973.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=976.26s)]
*  OK, so let's go deeper into something that you said a few moments ago about, you know, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=976.86s)]
*  there were manufacturing parts of, you know, parts of one product in Taiwan, another [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=982.74s)]
*  part in Singapore. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=987.82s)]
*  But given the efficiency, I think you said also the flexibility of the labor market in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=988.82s)]
*  China, it just became absolutely clear that things were going to be much, much more [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=995.14s)]
*  efficient and smooth if these products were made in China. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1000.98s)]
*  Let's use that as a way to talk about just table setting for people about how labor [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1005.62s)]
*  works in China, because most people, when they think about this topic, maybe they'll [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1011.9s)]
*  remember I certainly did before I read your book, the headline of the the Nets right [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1016.62s)]
*  outside of the manufacturing that was like capturing, trying to catch people that were [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1021.54s)]
*  jumping to their deaths out of despair, working in these factories. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1026.18s)]
*  It's an image that will always stay with me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1030.1s)]
*  How typical is that? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1033.62s)]
*  Is that a story that is unique to Apple or is this just sort of the rules of the road [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1034.9s)]
*  for manufacturing in China? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1041.58s)]
*  I love these big questions. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1043.62s)]
*  These are hard to answer because they're really big questions. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1044.98s)]
*  OK, so let's first talk about the labor supply because I don't think it's well understood. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1047.22s)]
*  So I'll try not to get too wonky on this, but cities like Shenzhen, where the original [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1050.9799999999998s)]
*  Apple products are built just across the harbor from Hong Kong, were like capitalist [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1057.62s)]
*  experimentation zones separate in a sense from the rest of the country. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1061.2199999999998s)]
*  And they were created to lure in capital, like foreign capital. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1065.8999999999999s)]
*  And for the first time after the Cultural Revolution era of Mao and whatnot, people [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1069.9799999999998s)]
*  were allowed to leave the village of their birth and go work on the coast, work in these [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1075.9799999999998s)]
*  cities. That was illegal under Mao. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1080.18s)]
*  You couldn't leave your village, essentially. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1081.5s)]
*  So Deng Xiaoping makes that possible. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1083.42s)]
*  And what you have is just Shenzhen just absolutely flourishing. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  So in 1980, it is not really even a city. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1088.5s)]
*  It's a series of fishing villages, population 70,000. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1090.8600000000001s)]
*  Today, it's a population of more than 7 million and far more skyscrapers in Shenzhen [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1094.26s)]
*  than there are in New York City. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1099.46s)]
*  Foxconn plays this absolutely instrumental role, transforming that city, probably worth [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1101.94s)]
*  unpacking that Foxconn is not Chinese. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  Foxconn is Taiwanese. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1108.02s)]
*  And so in 1987, there's sort of a detente between Taiwan and China. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1109.38s)]
*  And businessmen from Taiwan are allowed to go to mainland China. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1113.5s)]
*  And the Taiwanese, who are experts in manufacturing at this stage, begin to take advantage to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1116.66s)]
*  unprecedented degree of the labor coming into Shenzhen. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1121.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. So you've got all these people leaving the hinterlands where their alternative is [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1125.54s)]
*  like a 14 hour day toiling in the agricultural fields under the hot sun. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1129.06s)]
*  And they're OK doing a 12 hour shift in a factory instead. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1133.14s)]
*  So Apple is not at all unique setting up production in China. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1136.9s)]
*  If anything, they are late. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1139.9s)]
*  Like, I'm quite sympathetic to the idea that Apple didn't sort of hollow out American [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1141.3s)]
*  manufacturing and move things to China. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1144.54s)]
*  Like, they're the ones who were trying to build in America and they couldn't because [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1146.3s)]
*  everybody else had moved. And so their costs are too high. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1150.8600000000001s)]
*  So I'm deeply sympathetic to that period. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1153.38s)]
*  And of course, Washington at the time was very much encouraging the trade with China [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1156.02s)]
*  because we really thought we were going to inculcate the next great democracy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1159.7s)]
*  Well, let's pause on that for a second to just explain to people what you mean by that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1162.6200000000001s)]
*  The idea of allowing China in into the WTO in 2001, two months, as you note, after [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1166.3s)]
*  the iPod originally came out, was this idea that if capitalism is allowed to flourish [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1172.58s)]
*  inside China, then democracy and maybe even liberal democracy would necessarily follow. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1179.1799999999998s)]
*  And this was sort of the consensus view among liberals and conservatives. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1184.62s)]
*  I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1189.78s)]
*  That's 100 percent what what they believed. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1191.46s)]
*  And this is something that obviously did not turn out that way. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1194.54s)]
*  They got the the market flourishing, but not at all the liberalization, the political [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1198.3400000000001s)]
*  liberalization. Yeah. So in the 80s, Ronald Reagan was calling China a so-called communist [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1203.94s)]
*  country, right, because it looks so obvious that they were moving away from the communist [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1208.54s)]
*  worldview and adopting capitalism. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1216.02s)]
*  And some of my most or at least in my opinion, fascinating chapters, right, are trying to [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1218.5800000000002s)]
*  explain that to quote the title of a book, China was a dragon wearing a three piece suit. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1223.66s)]
*  In other words, they were sort of doing a fake it, tell you make it type type thing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1229.74s)]
*  But they weren't actually becoming Western. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1233.5800000000002s)]
*  It just appeared that way because they understood the optics were good for investment [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1235.8200000000002s)]
*  dollars coming in. But they were pretty adamant that the communists were still going to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1240.7s)]
*  maintain a great degree of control. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1246.3000000000002s)]
*  And frankly, we probably did a really poor strategic job of like being so public. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1248.38s)]
*  Right. And like arrogant of saying, arrogant, how? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1252.34s)]
*  Well, because Western policymakers like Bill Clinton and others were basically saying, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1255.6599999999999s)]
*  like, good luck maintaining your communism as the Internet rolls through your country. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1261.06s)]
*  Right. And so we were basically proclaiming that we were doing these trades with the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1266.86s)]
*  established goal that this was going to cause the downfall of the Communist Party. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1273.1s)]
*  So, of course, if you're in Beijing, you're thinking, well, what do we do to actually ensure [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1276.74s)]
*  this doesn't happen? Right. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1280.06s)]
*  So strategically, I think that was sort of inept on our part. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1281.74s)]
*  Well, if you are Xi or you're in the Chinese Communist Party and you think, what can we [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1285.58s)]
*  do? Well, maybe the story looks a lot like what China just did with Apple over the past [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1290.94s)]
*  two decades. In other words, lure American companies, you know, that manufacture products [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1295.26s)]
*  that Americans are unbelievably dependent on and make it so that the our most our wealthiest, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1303.3s)]
*  most valuable companies are completely dependent on an authoritarian regime. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1311.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think throughout the 2000s, Apple, this is to be true of other companies as [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1315.62s)]
*  well. But obviously, I focus on Apple. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1320.62s)]
*  Apple really would have thought we're calling the shots. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1322.26s)]
*  These suppliers are bending over backwards to do whatever it is we need of them. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1324.54s)]
*  And we're reaping all sorts of profit from this. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1329.34s)]
*  Right. But in the long term, I think China was getting pharma out of it because if for [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1331.3s)]
*  whatever reason, China canceled Apple's export license tomorrow, it's not like we can just [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1336.3799999999999s)]
*  start making iPhones here. We have no idea how to make them. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1340.22s)]
*  Or even if we have the idea, like even if Apple has the experiential know how, we can't [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1342.7s)]
*  execute the plans at all. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1346.46s)]
*  And I want you to explain why that is. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1348.1s)]
*  There's so many reasons. I mean, there was an analyst who was quoted a month ago, and I [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1349.78s)]
*  thought this is a pretty good quote. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  And yet it doesn't even really come close to the reality. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1354.1399999999999s)]
*  So let me explain. So the analyst said there are so many people working on iPhones that it [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1356.8999999999999s)]
*  would be like if the city of Boston, 500,000 people just gave up what they were doing and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1363.02s)]
*  they all started working on iPhone production. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1366.74s)]
*  OK, that's a great quote, except that what it doesn't account for is that what China [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1368.98s)]
*  really relies on is a floating population. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1372.86s)]
*  So it's actually more like the 500,000 people of Boston would work on iPhone for a couple [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1375.34s)]
*  of weeks and then the entire city would get up and go to Milwaukee or something and work [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1379.26s)]
*  on some other product. Right. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1383.5s)]
*  So like not only do we not have the density of population, we don't have the dynamism [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1384.86s)]
*  of the population. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1389.74s)]
*  OK, I want to push maybe a little bit on that word dynamism. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1391.2199999999998s)]
*  Isn't it also the servitude of that population? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1394.26s)]
*  Maybe that word is too strong for you. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1398.78s)]
*  But, you know, most Americans, even people that are willing to work very, very hard, do [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1400.3s)]
*  not expect to work 14, 15 hours a day in a factory with no weekend. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1406.8999999999999s)]
*  No. And the line I like to use is that not only do Americans not want to do these jobs, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1412.5s)]
*  the Chinese don't want to do these jobs. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1416.86s)]
*  So I have this stunning example. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1418.54s)]
*  I think it's around 2014. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1420.94s)]
*  And I'm quoting myself in the free press because I put it here. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1422.94s)]
*  But there's a Pegatron facility that had a standing state of 100,000 workers, but they [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1425.26s)]
*  were losing 25,000 workers a month. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1430.22s)]
*  So they were hiring 25,000 workers a month. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1433.5s)]
*  I mean, good luck competing with that sort of dynamism. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1436.18s)]
*  Right. We don't we just don't have factories that size. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1439.62s)]
*  But we don't have factories where we would even have 25,000 new people to to go through. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1441.98s)]
*  So I've got all these internal documents about it, for instance. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1446.42s)]
*  And like the average worker was staying at the company less than 65 days. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1448.54s)]
*  Right. So the churn is absolutely amazing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1453.06s)]
*  And you can only have that churn if the population is sort of like again, not to get too [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1455.74s)]
*  wonky. Their residence is in the rural China in the West. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1461.9s)]
*  And they're not allowed to raise their children in a city like Shenzhen or Suzhou or [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1465.46s)]
*  Shanghai. And so they're working in these factories on a temporary basis. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1468.98s)]
*  And then they go back to see their children sometimes only once a year at Chinese New [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1472.54s)]
*  Year. But again, so like not only do we do we can we not replicate that, we wouldn't [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1475.54s)]
*  want to replicate that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1480.14s)]
*  Right. And that's so that's what makes it so hard to compete with, because in addition [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1481.58s)]
*  to the density of the population and the low wages and stuff that we can't compete with, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1485.3s)]
*  like at a sort of philosophical level, this isn't what you and I would want our kids [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1488.66s)]
*  doing. Right. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1492.9s)]
*  And it only sort of is possible because of a certain desperation on the part of, you [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1495.18s)]
*  know, even though China is a very rich country, there are still hundreds of millions of [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1498.8600000000001s)]
*  people that have just a high school education and are willing to do these jobs. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1501.7s)]
*  So given that trade agreements don't really have like environmental standards that are [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1506.14s)]
*  codified across the world or labor standards that are codified across the world, China [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1511.26s)]
*  is just able to compete on a level that we're just never going to be able to grapple [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1515.42s)]
*  with. In the early days, when from Apple's perspective, China looked like a huge [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1519.0200000000002s)]
*  it was bending over backwards to Apple. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1525.14s)]
*  Did China actually, in fact, have a grand strategy in place? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1527.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's abundantly clear. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1532.5800000000002s)]
*  The line that I use in the introduction is that our understanding of Apple is one of [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1534.46s)]
*  Apple exploiting Chinese workers. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1538.98s)]
*  And I flipped it on its head and I say Beijing is allowing Apple to exploit Chinese [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1541.46s)]
*  workers so that Beijing can in turn exploit Apple. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1545.7800000000002s)]
*  In other words, Beijing understands that if we lure in the foreign capital, we will [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1548.8600000000001s)]
*  learn the technological know-how and use that for our own means. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1553.22s)]
*  And so Apple, in a sense, is the most successful company at resisting that. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1557.38s)]
*  But there are other examples where Western companies have done an awful job and just [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1562.02s)]
*  lost out on the order. So the sort of textbook example is high speed rail. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1566.22s)]
*  China didn't become high speed rail with a world leader by accident. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1570.22s)]
*  They drew in Kawasaki, Siemens, Allstom and Bombardier and basically put them in a [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1574.42s)]
*  prisoner's dilemma of saying, do you want the biggest orders in your entire existence? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1579.82s)]
*  Because we're building more rail car capacity than the rest of the world combined. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1584.1799999999998s)]
*  And so any of those companies could have thought, huh, I could say no. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1588.4199999999998s)]
*  But if my rivals say yes, they're going to be hitting all their targets and distributing [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1592.3s)]
*  dividends to their shareholders. And I'm going to be left out in the cold. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1596.46s)]
*  And so all four of them basically said yes. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1600.02s)]
*  And China was able to basically, quote unquote, learn from each and then develop, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1602.46s)]
*  synthesize what they learned into something new. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1606.02s)]
*  And then those companies basically lost all their orders in China over the next decade. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1608.46s)]
*  And then when California was doing high speed rail, it was the Chinese that were outbidding [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1612.02s)]
*  Siemens, Bombardier, etc. to win those orders. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1616.74s)]
*  So that's more of the textbook example. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1620.06s)]
*  What's interesting about Apple is that they've actually been able to resist. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1622.58s)]
*  They remain very successful. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1625.3799999999999s)]
*  But of course, my whole point is that it's quite a precarious success. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1627.02s)]
*  OK, let's talk a little bit more about the labor force, because that seems to be the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1631.02s)]
*  core piece of the puzzle here. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1636.3s)]
*  We don't have floating work populations of 100. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1638.1s)]
*  I mean, these numbers are insane. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1641.46s)]
*  More people are floating workers in China than there are Americans working at all. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1642.98s)]
*  Say that again. Like there are. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1648.7s)]
*  Say that again, because that's astonishing. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1650.1799999999998s)]
*  The estimates of the floating population is between 300 and 500 million people. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1651.5s)]
*  Rural people who go and work in these factories. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1656.1799999999998s)]
*  They do 14 hour days and then go on to the next factory. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  That's what you mean when you say I want to make sure people understand what you mean [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1662.4199999999998s)]
*  when you say floating worker. Yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1665.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, so it's a number counted in the Chinese census and it's between three and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1666.62s)]
*  500 million people. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1669.86s)]
*  There are a lot of examples in your book to choose from when it comes to explaining [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  the conditions of people that work in these factories. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1675.98s)]
*  But I want to just quote a relatively tame example. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1678.82s)]
*  Chinese workers you talk about would be packed and here I'm quoting from you, a [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1682.26s)]
*  hundred to a room arriving with a few possessions and a bucket to wash their clothes [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1686.06s)]
*  in. Overtime was mandatory and shifts could last for 15 hours a day. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1690.1399999999999s)]
*  One worker said, and this is a quote, we have to work too hard and I'm always tired. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1695.1s)]
*  It's like being in the army. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1699.3s)]
*  They make us stand still for hours. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1700.74s)]
*  If we moved, we are punished by me by being made to stand still for longer. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1702.42s)]
*  OK, we've talked about how these manufacturing plants are generally run by this [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1708.86s)]
*  Taiwanese subcontractor called Foxconn. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1713.54s)]
*  I want you to take us through like imagine I'm a worker showing up at one of these [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1716.26s)]
*  factories. Tell me what my average day would look like if I'm working making [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1720.5s)]
*  an iPhone in a factory. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1724.94s)]
*  Great question. So if you're just the average worker, you could be trained in what [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1726.78s)]
*  your task is in about 20 minutes. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1730.5s)]
*  And then your role would be to do something that takes maybe nine to 11 seconds on a [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1733.06s)]
*  conveyor belt line for 12 hours a day. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1737.22s)]
*  The same task. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1739.98s)]
*  Yep. Just putting a camera module in the left hand corner, something like that, you [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1741.06s)]
*  know, pinning in a little screw. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1744.02s)]
*  And, you know, there are penalties for laughing, penalties for talking. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1746.3799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the workers can actually get on almost like runners high, right, just [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1753.26s)]
*  doing the same thing in a monotonous way where you sort of zone out and get this [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1758.02s)]
*  work done. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1761.5s)]
*  And in the early 2000s, I mean, this is 50 cents an hour. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1764.3s)]
*  So like the thing is, Apple is not unique. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1767.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Foxconn is supplying, you know, other companies, PC companies. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1770.62s)]
*  But what I take away is that Apple sees the possibilities here that nobody else [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1774.62s)]
*  sees. And so Apple realizes, like the Johnny Ive studio realizes, we can make our [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1780.26s)]
*  computers madly intricate and these workers on this conveyor belt will do [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1785.66s)]
*  whatever is necessary to make these products at the quality and finish, etc. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1790.38s)]
*  that we want them to perform at. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1794.98s)]
*  And so everybody else is looking to China for volume and cost, right margin. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1797.8600000000001s)]
*  And Apple sees unconstrained design possibilities. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1802.5s)]
*  So it's not unique to be working with Foxconn. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1806.0600000000002s)]
*  It's not unique to have the floating population work on your products and not [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1808.26s)]
*  unique to be doing the same task for 12 or 14 hours a day. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1811.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, Apple, I think, would ramp that up because of the other other companies [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1815.1000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't have designs that necessitate the sort of manual labor that Apple [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1820.02s)]
*  needed. So I'm not sure that Dell would have the exact same conveyor belt line. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1826.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, like, you know, the show Nathan for you. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1833.54s)]
*  Yes. And he has this hilarious example. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1835.9s)]
*  Do I need to explain what Nathan for you? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1838.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1839.5s)]
*  OK, so Nathan for you fellow Canadian, right, has this great show where like [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1839.98s)]
*  he's posing himself as like a management guru. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1844.18s)]
*  And what's always funny is he has like new ideas for a business that have like a [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1846.94s)]
*  plausible ring to it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1850.8600000000001s)]
*  But of course, he takes them to comedic absurd extent. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1852.02s)]
*  And so in this one show, he has house cleaners. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1855.18s)]
*  I think 30 of them show up at one house. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1858.9s)]
*  Right. And they all have six minutes or something to perform their task. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1860.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. So he's sort of toying with Adam Smith's division of labor, taking it to [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1864.1000000000001s)]
*  an extreme and say, could we clean a whole house in six minutes? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1867.86s)]
*  That's comedy. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1870.86s)]
*  Apple was doing this for computers 25 years ago where the tasks were nine to eleven [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1872.3s)]
*  seconds. So it took the Adam Smith division of labor idea to like a point that [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1876.8999999999999s)]
*  like is way beyond what a comedian thinks is interesting. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1882.54s)]
*  Right. Or funny. So it's like you have to just imagine like Apple just saw [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1886.82s)]
*  something in China where they could have this like zero defect culture, ridiculously [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1892.1399999999999s)]
*  intricate designs. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1897.5s)]
*  And they just had a realization of like we can get this done in China. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1898.82s)]
*  And nobody was competing with them on design. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1902.5s)]
*  Most people are never going to go to China. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1904.58s)]
*  They're never going to go to these places that you mentioned in the book. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1906.34s)]
*  They're not thinking about Chinese grand strategy. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1909.82s)]
*  Most people they're thinking, is it ethical for me to own an iPhone? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1912.18s)]
*  Yeah. And so just not being an activist, I don't really get into that question. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1915.78s)]
*  I mean, put it this way. If there were a viable, you know, American, Canadian made, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1920.14s)]
*  you know, phone that I could get instead of Apple, yeah, I would absolutely buy it. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1924.9s)]
*  There isn't more than one out of two phones sold globally are made in China or [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1928.5s)]
*  sorry, are Chinese brands. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1933.66s)]
*  Another fifth are Apple phones that are all made in China. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1935.7800000000002s)]
*  And really the only outlier these days is Samsung. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1938.42s)]
*  So you can make an ethical choice to buy Samsung. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1941.74s)]
*  And I do think they're made in a more ethical way in the sense that Samsung is [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1944.42s)]
*  in South Korea, which is a thriving democracy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, there's a free press that is able to cover those factories and has [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1952.22s)]
*  gone after workers that are sorry, gone after plants that have caused leukemia and [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1955.7s)]
*  their workers and stuff like not to jump ahead too much. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1959.3s)]
*  But like there's this narrative that a common Westerner will assume, which is that, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1962.3799999999999s)]
*  oh, Tim Cook and Apple would very much like if China were to liberalize. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1968.26s)]
*  I don't know that that's clear. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1972.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the fact that there's like a media blackout on these issues. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1974.5s)]
*  I don't think that's a common narrative at all. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1977.74s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1979.6599999999999s)]
*  I think the common narrative is much more malevolent. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1981.02s)]
*  I mean, it's assuming a level of malevolence. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1985.38s)]
*  It's assuming that, you know, of course, you know, these giant American behemoths [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1987.38s)]
*  benefit from outsourcing the most tedious tasks to a country where, you know, the [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=1992.94s)]
*  workers expect to earn I don't know how much they earn a day at these places. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2000.38s)]
*  I know you don't want to talk about the tedium of it, but it makes it more urgent [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2003.8600000000001s)]
*  and real for a lot of people. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2006.9s)]
*  But regardless, I think most people would think that's great for Apple. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2007.9s)]
*  OK, well, I'm with those people. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2013.26s)]
*  Maybe there's a difference between sort of like laypeople if you just interview [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2015.18s)]
*  them on the street. I think you're right about that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2018.8600000000001s)]
*  But I think journalists would assume, oh, you shouldn't hold Apple to account for [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2020.26s)]
*  bad conditions in China because if they could change them, they would. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2024.5800000000002s)]
*  But they can't. That's what I'm questioning. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2027.3000000000002s)]
*  How does what you call low welfare and low human rights labor tell tell me how it [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2029.7s)]
*  benefits all of the different parties involved in the manufacture of Apple [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2037.02s)]
*  products? So, you know, by having all this all these facilities that are really [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2040.74s)]
*  like, you know, almost like made to order in a certain sense, like if you're a [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2046.82s)]
*  factory developer and you're going to get new orders, the Chinese government will [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2049.82s)]
*  work with your hand in glove to build at just insane speeds where we would still [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2053.42s)]
*  honestly be doing the environmental paperwork by the time the factory goes up [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2058.14s)]
*  in China. And they're doing that because China's ability to scale is so dramatic [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2061.14s)]
*  that it basically undercuts international competition and like literally plays a [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2069.58s)]
*  role deindustrializing all rival nations. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2074.06s)]
*  So like think of like just get outside the iPhone for a second, think of a solar [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2077.34s)]
*  panel. I mean, those are created in the 1950s by America. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2080.5s)]
*  And until the 1980s, I think we were doing 80 or 90 percent of the production. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2083.9s)]
*  Now it's three percent and it's three percent because China just made massive [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2088.06s)]
*  investments and it has the political backing to make those investments and it [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2092.14s)]
*  doesn't go after profit. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2096.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, so just to rant for a second, like there was an essay a month or two in [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2097.1800000000003s)]
*  foreign affairs and it was trying to make the case that America was still [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2100.14s)]
*  competitive and like, you know, eight major industries or whatever. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2103.34s)]
*  But the metric it was using was ridiculous. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2105.98s)]
*  Now, the metric was profit. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2107.98s)]
*  OK, well, from a capitalist Western perspective, profit is the metric you should [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2110.3s)]
*  go after. And if you've got 40 percent or what have you of the profit in the [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2114.1s)]
*  industry, you would say, oh, yeah, we're doing really well. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2116.82s)]
*  The Chinese aren't after profit. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2119.1400000000003s)]
*  The Chinese are after razor thin margins and taking control of the sectors [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2120.7000000000003s)]
*  so that then nobody else can compete with them. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2125.5800000000004s)]
*  And in the long term, they are the only ones capable of doing it. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2128.3s)]
*  Right. So they're not after profit. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2131.2200000000003s)]
*  And so this is really interesting when it gets to Apple's supply chain, because [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2132.82s)]
*  what we have now and I know you don't want me to fast forward, but is that the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2136.1800000000003s)]
*  Chinese companies rather than the multinationals operating in China, they're [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2140.02s)]
*  the ones who can get the free land. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2144.3s)]
*  They're the ones who can get the machinery and the subsidies. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2146.5s)]
*  And what does that mean? That means that they can operate at lower margins. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2149.78s)]
*  And so over time, more and more Chinese [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2152.6200000000003s)]
*  red supply chain companies are taking on the orders at the expense of [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2156.6200000000003s)]
*  multinationals operating in China. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2160.02s)]
*  And so you're asking, like, what does China get out of these low wage jobs? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2162.1400000000003s)]
*  They're taking over these industries to such an extent that we can't compete [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2165.82s)]
*  with them. And so I know this is an obvious question. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2169.86s)]
*  Why do they want to take over these industries? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2172.74s)]
*  Well, manufacturing is some absurd portion of their GDP. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2174.7799999999997s)]
*  And one of the opening quotes of my book is from Made in China 2015. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2178.86s)]
*  So like a Xi Jinping document. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2183.74s)]
*  And it says, without manufacturing, there is no nation. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2185.34s)]
*  I mean, so does that mean we're not a nation? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2188.54s)]
*  Well, that's interesting. So like that's almost a quote of Alexander Hamilton, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2191.38s)]
*  which is really interesting. So right. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2195.1s)]
*  So he has this famous paper, you know, where he argues that [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2196.42s)]
*  manufacturing will cement American independence. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2200.98s)]
*  And after World War Two, when America literally holds 50 percent capacity of all [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2204.62s)]
*  global manufacturing, we tweaked the model a little bit. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2209.02s)]
*  And we said manufacturing is going to cement interdependence. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2212.94s)]
*  And in like the four four decade battle with the Soviet Union, the reason why [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2216.9s)]
*  our economy did so well versus that of the Soviets is they were pretty isolated [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2221.18s)]
*  from this global network. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2225.26s)]
*  You know, think of Thomas Friedman. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2226.98s)]
*  The world is flat. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2228.82s)]
*  No two countries that have McDonald's have ever gone to war with each other. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2230.1s)]
*  Right. He called that the Golden Arches theory of diplomacy. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2233.3s)]
*  The rise of Japan, even postwar Germany, you know, with Volkswagen and whatnot, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2235.7400000000002s)]
*  like South Korea, all these countries were based on trade. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2240.7400000000002s)]
*  And by isolating the Soviet Union, we accelerated their demise. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2244.14s)]
*  We got arrogant with it in the 1990s, right. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2247.7000000000003s)]
*  The unipolar moment for quoting Charles Krauthammer. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2250.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think China could have been isolated and we could have had this opportunity [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2252.94s)]
*  to sort of, you know, boot out the the communists and maybe [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2257.9799999999996s)]
*  then we could have integrated them into the world economy. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2262.7799999999997s)]
*  But we thought, no, no, no, we'll actually just like have the communists join our [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2265.7799999999997s)]
*  system and then we'll work with them that way. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2269.4199999999996s)]
*  And whoops, we accidentally enriched China's rulers and now they're in a better [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2272.2999999999997s)]
*  position than they ever have been. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2276.06s)]
*  They're pretty precarious in the late 1990s. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2277.66s)]
*  And we had a we had a position that I don't criticize. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2280.02s)]
*  Like it was clearly wrong in retrospect, but I take the arguments in good faith. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2284.86s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2291.02s)]
*  Like some of the scholarship that's coming out now is like, oh, that Americans knew [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2291.54s)]
*  all along that it was just Western businessmen doing this for greed and things [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2294.94s)]
*  like that. But I think there was a genuine sense that if you had, you know, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2298.02s)]
*  there's this quote, if commerce doesn't cross borders, armies will. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2301.5s)]
*  And you could point to something like Taiwan. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2304.98s)]
*  I mean, Taiwan is under martial law for decades before their first democratic [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2306.38s)]
*  elections in the late 1990s. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2310.54s)]
*  And because it's ethnically Chinese, we thought, oh, that's a great example that [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2312.3799999999997s)]
*  the Chinese in Beijing will do the same. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2315.9399999999996s)]
*  And we made a strategic error. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2317.8999999999996s)]
*  But I think the point you're making is to maybe put it another way. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2319.22s)]
*  The CCP has a grand strategy. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2322.18s)]
*  Absolutely. And they're thinking in terms not just of, you know, quarters and [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2324.58s)]
*  profits, but they're thinking in terms of decades. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2329.8999999999996s)]
*  They're thinking in terms of centuries and they're thinking in terms of their grand [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2332.74s)]
*  vision of the Chinese place in the world. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2336.3799999999997s)]
*  Contrast that with the mentality of someone. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2339.34s)]
*  And I'm not picking on him. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2341.86s)]
*  It could be any American CEO doing business in China, but the mentality of a Tim [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2343.7s)]
*  Cook, he's just not thinking that way. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2347.82s)]
*  Or is he? No, I think they totally sleepwalked into this. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2349.94s)]
*  So my favorite quote in the book comes from, you know, a former vice president [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2353.54s)]
*  were having coffee and he says, are you sure you're not overthinking your thesis? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2357.34s)]
*  You keep telling me about geopolitics, but I will tell you, I was there in the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2361.54s)]
*  early 2000s when we were setting up our Chinese supply chain. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2365.62s)]
*  And we weren't thinking about geopolitics at all. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2368.54s)]
*  Right. And I think exactly that's my thesis in a nutshell. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2371.3s)]
*  You had no idea what you were doing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2375.74s)]
*  You were setting up operationally the world's most sophisticated supply chain. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2377.42s)]
*  And you made the rookie and calamitous mistake of putting all your eggs in one [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2381.38s)]
*  basket and the basket transformed into a surveillance state. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2384.82s)]
*  Was there any dissent? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2387.7s)]
*  Were there any dissident voices either inside Apple or inside the American sort [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2389.38s)]
*  of foreign policy or national security establishment during these the years of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2394.46s)]
*  especially the early 2000s, but maybe even the 2010s who were warning and saying, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2399.5s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, this is not going to end well. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2404.58s)]
*  So my favorite character in the book is a guy named John Ford, and he's this [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2406.94s)]
*  Mormon missionary who speaks, you know, pretty fluent Mandarin because he goes to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2410.7s)]
*  Taiwan as a missionary and he's running the Apple Store during these insane years [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2414.54s)]
*  of the iPhone becomes the most conspicuous status symbol in the country that everybody [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2420.74s)]
*  wants. And this is like such an insane narrative because he's like quasi gangsters [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2425.58s)]
*  recognize this opportunity that we can distribute iPhones across the country because at [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2430.3399999999997s)]
*  the time there's only four stores for the iPhone or for Apple stores in the country. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2434.18s)]
*  So this is 2010. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2439.2599999999998s)]
*  So think of that one store per 350 million people. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2440.46s)]
*  OK, and they're only in two cities. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2444.06s)]
*  And so there's a city like Chongqing population, 32 million number of Apple stores, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2445.66s)]
*  zero. If you can amass iPhones in massive quantities and go to Chongqing, you are the [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2449.82s)]
*  monopolist distributor of the world's most iconic product and you're selling them, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2454.82s)]
*  you know, double the price that they retail for. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2458.1000000000004s)]
*  So he really knows China. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2460.0600000000004s)]
*  He's got real street smarts. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2461.5s)]
*  What he struggles with is communicating what's going on back to Cupertino. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2463.1400000000003s)]
*  And so he's saying around 2012 to anyone who will listen, you're going to have some [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2467.2200000000003s)]
*  pretty nervous officials if we start building big factories in Vietnam. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2471.82s)]
*  And Apple just doesn't really get it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2475.5s)]
*  And they're just doubling down and tripling down. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2477.78s)]
*  So that's one example. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2479.98s)]
*  And I've got a few others in the book, but there's absolutely dissonant voices within [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2481.34s)]
*  Apple. In fact, I would argue, you know, how did I speak to more than 200 people? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2484.38s)]
*  It's because it's not that I spoke to 200 disgruntled former employees, right. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2487.94s)]
*  It's that there's a lot of people within Apple, including current employees, who are [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2491.38s)]
*  not happy with the consolidation into China over the last 20 years. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2495.34s)]
*  And they're upset about it. And they will think very happily of Apple. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2498.9s)]
*  Most of my sources give me the blue bubble back when I'm texting them. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2502.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. They're on iPhones. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2504.5800000000004s)]
*  But they don't love what Tim Cook has done in China. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2506.18s)]
*  OK, let's talk a little bit about how Apple benefits from China and for [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2509.2599999999998s)]
*  from manufacturing in China. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2514.02s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about how China has benefited from Apple. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2515.62s)]
*  You argue in the book that China wouldn't be China without Apple. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2519.34s)]
*  I want you to explain what you mean by that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2523.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's that should sound totally unhinged. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2524.94s)]
*  It does. I mean, Apple wouldn't be Apple without China. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2527.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's intuitive. Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2530.3s)]
*  China wouldn't be China without Apple. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2531.62s)]
*  It's like, what are you talking about? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2533.18s)]
*  It took me a long time to get there. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2534.66s)]
*  I think this will be a good answer. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2537.06s)]
*  Let me sort of describe the pyramid structure to you. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2538.46s)]
*  So we know the top of the pyramid. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2541.3399999999997s)]
*  This is how a product gets made at Apple. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2543.42s)]
*  Starts with industrial design. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2545.2999999999997s)]
*  So this is Johnny Ive with his sexy British accent explaining the look, feel [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2546.9s)]
*  and substance of what an Apple product is going to look like. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2550.42s)]
*  Right. His studio is the one that says we're going to have translucent plastics. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2552.46s)]
*  We're going to create an all white product with a chrome chrome back and it's [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2555.8199999999997s)]
*  going to have a thousand songs in it. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2558.74s)]
*  He sends it over the fence to product design. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2560.18s)]
*  So from ID to PD, product design is like fitting all the electronic [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2562.5s)]
*  components into said design. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2565.58s)]
*  Right. And you really can't push back against Johnny unless he says something [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2567.34s)]
*  that like, you know, it's like physically impossible. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2570.7000000000003s)]
*  You have to do what he says. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2573.26s)]
*  And so those people have to be geniuses in their own right to figure out how it [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2574.38s)]
*  can all work. The third group is my favorite group of sources. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2577.42s)]
*  OK, they're called MD manufacturing design. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2582.1400000000003s)]
*  These are the people that are usually based in California, but they fly out to [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2585.06s)]
*  factories in China and they co-invent either the processes or the parts [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2588.74s)]
*  or both that are actually going to do this at scale. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2593.7799999999997s)]
*  Wow. And then once they figure that out, it goes to the group associated with Tim [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2596.8199999999997s)]
*  Cook, which is operations. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2600.9799999999996s)]
*  And they're the ones who scale and they build resilience with the supply chain. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2602.22s)]
*  But the MD people are figuring out what those nine second component [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2605.2999999999997s)]
*  processes on the line are going to be. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2609.9799999999996s)]
*  Yes. And so what happens is you have these MD people going over to China, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2611.9399999999996s)]
*  finding that there's really no tech competence like year and year out. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2616.62s)]
*  Johnny Ive is coming up with designs that nobody has ever thought of before in the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2619.86s)]
*  PC industry or the iPod or the phone industry. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2622.86s)]
*  And so there's no like I don't even think they're outsourcing in the traditional [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2626.06s)]
*  sense. Like you can't send over some blueprints and these Chinese factories just [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2631.1s)]
*  do what you need them to do. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2634.3s)]
*  That is true of Dell. Right. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2635.7000000000003s)]
*  That Dell's not sort of upending how a computer looks and feels every year. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2636.98s)]
*  But Apple was right, especially in the heyday. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2641.34s)]
*  And so they're going to at first dozens of factories, but later hundreds of [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2644.26s)]
*  factories. And not only are they like co-inventing processes and doing like [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2648.26s)]
*  proprietary software on the machines to make this make this stuff run, but they [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2652.62s)]
*  are purchasing the machinery in the hundreds of millions of dollars and then [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2657.34s)]
*  later in the billions of dollars. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2662.54s)]
*  Right. So in other words, you're not relying on a factory that has certain set [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2664.62s)]
*  skills. You're giving them those skills and you're you're spending billions of [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2667.98s)]
*  dollars on the machinery, allowing them to operate not just above their [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2672.62s)]
*  perceived capabilities, but their actual capabilities because they wouldn't have [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2676.42s)]
*  the money to invest anyway. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2679.7799999999997s)]
*  So the brilliant example of this is in 2008, Apple creates what's sort of known [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2681.2999999999997s)]
*  by journalists and such as the Unibody MacBook. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2686.06s)]
*  OK, Unibody just refers to it's not sort of like different parts of metal that are [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2688.7s)]
*  welded together. It's one piece of metal that's like extruded in such a way that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2692.58s)]
*  then like the keyboard can be placed inside and such. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2698.06s)]
*  And so it's a totally different way of making notebooks. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2700.5s)]
*  And it's done with a CNC machine that costs upwards of a million dollars each. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2703.6200000000003s)]
*  And Apple buys about 10,000 of them to do that scale. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2707.46s)]
*  So CNC's have been around forever, but you prototype things with them because they're [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2710.98s)]
*  so expensive. Apple has the money and the wherewithal and the imagination, quite [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2713.94s)]
*  frankly, to purchase 10,000 a year for multiple years. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2717.0600000000004s)]
*  And it puts them in other people's factories and then sort of tags them for [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2720.86s)]
*  Apple use only and begins producing laptops in a totally novel way that [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2723.98s)]
*  eventually gets replicated by everybody. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2728.34s)]
*  So now loads of factories in China can do that. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2729.7400000000002s)]
*  But they were my point is they're bringing that capability. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2732.06s)]
*  They're bringing that genius to China. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2735.02s)]
*  And so you think of who these empty people are. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2736.98s)]
*  It's America's top engineers. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2739.06s)]
*  I mean, if you're Apple, you hire whoever the hell you want coming out of Caltech, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2740.46s)]
*  hiring them from Tesla, whatever you want to do, and then you're sending them on a [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2743.34s)]
*  plane to China. So I can't tell you how many people I would say, well, when was [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2746.5s)]
*  your first trip to China? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2749.6600000000003s)]
*  And it was like, oh, the day I got the job at Apple, like I showed up and they said, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2751.1400000000003s)]
*  here's your flight. Right. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2754.06s)]
*  So the job of these people was to go to China and train, train, train, audit, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2755.5s)]
*  supervise, purchase, machinery, for etc. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2759.54s)]
*  So they take unprecedented control of the supply networks in China. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2761.78s)]
*  So it's not just the machines they're buying. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2765.82s)]
*  It's not just the investment. It's also the training. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2767.9s)]
*  China, this is according. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2771.1800000000003s)]
*  This number blew my mind. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2773.66s)]
*  Apple has trained 20 million, 28 million workers in China since 2008. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2776.06s)]
*  Yeah. And this is your Berlin Wall line, which I want you to repeat because it [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2781.98s)]
*  really I think it's incredible. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2784.66s)]
*  This transfer of knowledge constitutes a geopolitical event like that of the fall [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2786.3399999999997s)]
*  of the Berlin Wall. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2791.3799999999997s)]
*  But except of course, when the Berlin Wall fell, it was the end of communism. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2793.02s)]
*  So draw it out for us a little bit more. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2797.58s)]
*  Yeah. What are the implications? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2799.7799999999997s)]
*  This is kind of the other reason I go back towards the Marshall Plan. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2801.46s)]
*  So people probably remember something of the Marshall Plan from their high school [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2804.02s)]
*  textbooks and stuff. Right. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2806.62s)]
*  It was essentially like Europe's in crisis after World War Two. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2807.8999999999996s)]
*  It's impoverished. And they worry that the Soviet Union is sort of going to expand [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2810.66s)]
*  westward, you know, if not through a military, then ideologically, right. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2814.38s)]
*  Young people are going to be attracted to communism. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2817.46s)]
*  So Marshall Plan, you know, aside from the dollars and investment, it's all it's [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2819.42s)]
*  all it's an anti-communism gesture. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2823.06s)]
*  Right. The Cook Plan. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2825.02s)]
*  I'm trying not to be too biting here, but I think it's actually pretty clear. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2827.1800000000003s)]
*  The Cook Plan was about sort of ingratiating Apple with communist leadership. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2830.38s)]
*  So in a certain sense, it was it's the dollars of the Marshall Plan with the [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2834.62s)]
*  politics inverted. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2837.82s)]
*  It actually helped to establish the Communist Party rather than ward off that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2838.98s)]
*  threat. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2843.9s)]
*  That is a real I mean, that is a pretty astonishing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2845.98s)]
*  That's how I see it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2849.06s)]
*  It took me months to grapple with the implications of what I was being told. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2851.14s)]
*  I want you to spell out a little bit more like politically what that what is what [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2856.46s)]
*  that means. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2862.1s)]
*  So does it mean for American CEOs to have reified, solidified, strengthened, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2863.38s)]
*  bolstered the actively the Chinese Communist Party? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2870.7s)]
*  And do you think that do you think that Tim Cook has any self understanding or [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2873.98s)]
*  self awareness that that's what he helped usher in? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2879.02s)]
*  So I've spoken to people at Apple who still don't see this as a problem. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2882.22s)]
*  So I'm going to put him in that category. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2886.1s)]
*  I've never interviewed him, but that would be my guess. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2888.06s)]
*  And I say that because the senior people who don't see this as a problem and in a [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2892.7799999999997s)]
*  sense don't understand where I'm why I'm questioning. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2897.22s)]
*  Is they say we don't have a problem with China. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2900.7s)]
*  China would never cut Apple out of the equation because we are training them so [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2903.4199999999996s)]
*  much that that's created like safety for us. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2907.3799999999997s)]
*  And I mean, to be fair, you could give a sympathetic view and you say, look, what [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2911.3399999999997s)]
*  China has done the last 25, 30 years has taken hundreds of millions of people out [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2915.58s)]
*  of poverty. Totally. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2919.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. And that's a net good. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2920.58s)]
*  And if you're thinking in terms of the people, that is a net good. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2922.66s)]
*  And so when I'm talking to engineers who trained loads of people, they would have [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2925.9399999999996s)]
*  Chinese friends and they would feel delighted that they were that they were [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2928.66s)]
*  improving these people's lives. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2931.8599999999997s)]
*  The problem, of course, is that China didn't become some great ally. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2933.22s)]
*  It became a belligerent foe who wants to reincorporate Taiwan and set up [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2936.3399999999997s)]
*  concentration camps for Uyghurs. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2940.54s)]
*  And so it's. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2941.8199999999997s)]
*  But there's a level of delusion involved in imagining that China could never [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2943.06s)]
*  cut Apple out. How can you believe that in an era after the disappearance of Jack [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2949.1s)]
*  Ma? And we could point to dozens and dozens and dozens of examples. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2953.7799999999997s)]
*  How is that even possible? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2958.1s)]
*  Yeah. So this is where a few of the conversations kind of went cold. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2959.58s)]
*  Right. And so when you said things like that, when I would ask about it, honestly, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2962.54s)]
*  sometimes and I think this is even reflective of some of the quotes I use, you [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2967.06s)]
*  can tell the person's thinking about it for the first time. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2971.1400000000003s)]
*  Right. So like another one of my favorite quotes is when someone is part of his [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2974.46s)]
*  quote, he says, you know, we were just there building the most immaculate thing. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2980.06s)]
*  And then the second half of his quote is something like, I guess we were [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2985.94s)]
*  unwittingly tooling them up, giving them experiential know how. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2988.9s)]
*  And what I'm pinpointing there is the I guess he seems to be thinking on the spot, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=2994.3s)]
*  huh, in a reflective way. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3000.42s)]
*  Yeah, I guess we did do that. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3002.42s)]
*  And I'm not trying to condemn this person, but I do think that there was this [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3004.5s)]
*  engineering mindset where you weren't pontificating matters of state. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3008.7400000000002s)]
*  Apple makes you work really, really hard. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3013.02s)]
*  Right. I mean, so much so that one of my favorite anecdotes of the book is that in [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3015.58s)]
*  the first five years of Steve Jobs' comeback, there are so many marriages that [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3018.9399999999996s)]
*  are ending that Apple has to institute what engineers called the DAP, the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3022.2999999999997s)]
*  Divorce Avoidance Program. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3026.5s)]
*  OK. And this is a series of days off. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3028.58s)]
*  It's an understanding that Barry's not going to be in today because our [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3030.58s)]
*  marriage is on the line. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3033.14s)]
*  And then that works for a time, except that we need Barry. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3035.02s)]
*  Right. And so we can't just have Barry off because our marriage is on the line. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3038.2999999999997s)]
*  So let's give Nellie a ten thousand dollar bonus every time Barry sent to China. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3041.78s)]
*  I mean, that's the degree of, you know, we like the narrative we have is that the [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3046.7000000000003s)]
*  Chinese work really hard and that's an important narrative. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3050.46s)]
*  Apple works really fricking hard, too. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3052.54s)]
*  Right. And those engineers were really struggling with their marriages because [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3054.42s)]
*  they were going back and forth all the time. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3058.1800000000003s)]
*  And then, you know, I have examples of like, you know, someone over at Christmas [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3060.58s)]
*  dinner just coming back, I mean, just like literally falls asleep into a shepherd's [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3064.1s)]
*  pie at the table because he's just so exhausted from all the work he's been [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3067.5s)]
*  doing in China. So what I'm trying to say is if you think about how hard those [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3071.78s)]
*  people are working, they're not sitting around, you know, learning Mandarin, let [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3075.38s)]
*  alone reading books about China and thinking politically. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3079.14s)]
*  They're thinking, I need to get the job done. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3082.38s)]
*  And I work for a company that is excellent and ruthless. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3084.18s)]
*  And I'm proud to work building products that Americans and people all over the [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3087.98s)]
*  world value so much. That's what they're thinking. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3092.82s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. There's all kinds of good things that are going on. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3094.46s)]
*  And just think of the scale of Apple. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3096.8999999999996s)]
*  I love Apple products. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3098.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I look the whole book, A, was written on a MacBook. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3099.4599999999996s)]
*  Of course, it was. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3102.8999999999996s)]
*  Was written in the Notes app. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3104.22s)]
*  It might be the first book ever written in the Notes app. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3105.5s)]
*  It's such an underrated app, partly because it's end to end encrypted, by the way. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3107.8599999999997s)]
*  I was really worried about China hacking me, certainly. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3111.4199999999996s)]
*  And I I really trust Apple in terms of privacy and stuff. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3114.8199999999997s)]
*  But I worried about Apple hacking me as well. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3117.58s)]
*  I don't know. I took some pretty good precautions. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3119.7799999999997s)]
*  Really? I mean, you know, it's in this anonymous iCloud account. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3121.3799999999997s)]
*  So my hope is that even if someone's trying to hack me, they don't know where to look. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3124.8599999999997s)]
*  One of the big stories politically right now at the moment is the way that [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3129.62s)]
*  and I want to be careful with my language here, but I'll just I'll mimic the language [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3136.1s)]
*  that's being used in public discourse that, you know, our elites are the billionaire [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3140.3399999999997s)]
*  class, the people that are only concerned about their private jet lifestyle have [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3145.54s)]
*  essentially hollowed out the American middle and working class, hollowed out [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3150.82s)]
*  previous manufacturing towns like my hometown of Pittsburgh. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3156.02s)]
*  And not only have they done that to Americans, they've also inadvertently [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3159.5s)]
*  or intentionally, depending on who you ask, bolstered the economy and the knowhow [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3164.42s)]
*  of an authoritarian regime. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3170.1000000000004s)]
*  Yes. I want you to contend with the first part of that, that the brain drain to China [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3171.7000000000003s)]
*  or let's just say the manufacturing drain to China hollowed out the American [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3176.58s)]
*  working class because you made the argument earlier in this conversation that that's [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3182.74s)]
*  actually maybe a politically convenient thing to say, but it's not true because [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3186.54s)]
*  you're saying Apple was already late to the game. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3190.98s)]
*  This was going to happen anyway. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3192.94s)]
*  Well, it depends if you're blaming the whole electronics industry or Apple. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3194.74s)]
*  I don't think you can blame Apple. You could blame the electronics industry. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3197.66s)]
*  Talk about both. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3200.2599999999998s)]
*  But I would say it was done in good faith and a lot of good came out of it. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3201.2599999999998s)]
*  I think it's amazing that, you know, globalization helps Taiwan, helps South Korea, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3205.2599999999998s)]
*  help Japan. I mean, these are thriving democracies. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3210.58s)]
*  It's only problematic when you when you're doing it with a country that's quite [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3213.3399999999997s)]
*  belligerent, obviously authoritarian. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3216.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's a totalitarian surveillance state. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3219.02s)]
*  And it's so large that it's not just like a contributor to industries. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3221.1s)]
*  It has the potential and obviously the capacity to totally dominate them. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3226.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, where I'm less sympathetic is I don't think you can really say that there's [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3231.2999999999997s)]
*  some alternative universe where. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3238.7s)]
*  America remains a giant manufacturing force. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3242.1s)]
*  Like, could the iPhone have been made in Pittsburgh? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3245.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like, I just don't think I think that's a fantasy. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3247.5s)]
*  OK, certainly it's not going to happen now, but could it have happened back then? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3249.9s)]
*  What people don't get is that's a quantity, right? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3254.22s)]
*  So a thousand parts per iPhone, a million iPhones are being shipped per day [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3256.78s)]
*  at peak season. So do the math. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3261.34s)]
*  That's a billion parts that you're not only manufacturing a day, but you're [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3263.1000000000004s)]
*  running the logistics for and you're doing it in a just in time manufacturing [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3267.26s)]
*  method. That's never going to happen in Pittsburgh. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3271.02s)]
*  That's not a political point. That's just basic reality, right? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3274.26s)]
*  You could point to physics or something. It's just not never going to happen. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3277.42s)]
*  Where I am bullish would be French shoring. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3280.1800000000003s)]
*  So India and Mexico in particular. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3283.3399999999997s)]
*  And, you know, again, I don't hold out Apple for being or I don't call out Apple [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3286.06s)]
*  for what they did in the late 90s, early 2000s, but I do for the 2013. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3290.74s)]
*  So when Xi Jinping attacks Apple within 36 hours of taking power, that should have [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3294.62s)]
*  been a wake up call for Apple to realize, oh, shit. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3299.3399999999997s)]
*  Remind people what happened then, because most people won't remember. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3302.66s)]
*  Twenty thirteen, March 15th, there's something called Consumer Day. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3305.54s)]
*  Happens every year, goes back to 1991 and it's CCTV, sort of the CNN [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3309.58s)]
*  of China, if you will. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3315.1s)]
*  And they call out various companies for not living up to the socialist ethos. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3316.66s)]
*  And increasingly in the 2000s, it becomes Western companies. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3321.5s)]
*  So in 2012, it's McDonald's that's called out for food violations. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3324.78s)]
*  And in 2013, it's Apple. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3327.98s)]
*  Apple is called out for warranty differences. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3330.26s)]
*  That sounds really small, right? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3333.2200000000003s)]
*  The allegation is that Apple has a different warranty for the Chinese than the [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3335.5s)]
*  rest of the world, and therefore it's sort of exploiting and taking advantage [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3339.38s)]
*  and treating the Chinese in some inferior way. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3343.26s)]
*  When Apple just thinks our warranty policies are basically the same. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3347.1400000000003s)]
*  And so they just issue this sort of like. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, press correction of understanding this press release that [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3353.02s)]
*  basically says like, no, we don't like they're the same. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3355.98s)]
*  And then just throws off this throw away line. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3358.78s)]
*  Like we offer an incomparable user experience for three weeks. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3360.98s)]
*  They're under attack. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3366.1400000000003s)]
*  Essentially, I call it a digital blitzkrieg where regulators, newspapers of all kinds, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3367.34s)]
*  opinion writers are attacking Apple for this arrogant attitude and the people's daily. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3373.5s)]
*  So think of like the New York Times of China on a front page editorial says to strike [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3378.9s)]
*  down Apple's incomparable arrogance. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3384.54s)]
*  Right. So they're stealing incomparable from Apple and they're sort of riffing on that. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3386.86s)]
*  This is all happening within 24 hours, 36 hours of Xi Jinping becoming president. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3390.6200000000003s)]
*  So it's really interesting. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3396.14s)]
*  It's like this new sheriff in town. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3397.62s)]
*  He could not be more clear that he sees Apple as this exploitative force. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3399.66s)]
*  And what's the conversation inside Apple at the highest levels of Apple as this is [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3403.9s)]
*  happening? So is there any sense of like, oh, we got to we got to change course here? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3408.34s)]
*  Yeah. So at first, there's confusion because again, they just think, well, our warranties are [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3412.98s)]
*  the same. So three weeks go by. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3416.66s)]
*  And then Tim Cook issues an apology on Apple's China website in Mandarin, according to one [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3419.7s)]
*  source. And I just put this in parentheses. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3425.18s)]
*  Tim Cook also flies to China and is made to kowtow, according to someone. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3426.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. They say the Chinese don't let you just write a letter. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3431.3799999999997s)]
*  You have to go and bow in person. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3433.66s)]
*  I think it's worth including, but I don't know that for a fact. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3435.7s)]
*  It's a single source. It's in parentheses. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3437.94s)]
*  I just want to make that clear. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3439.8199999999997s)]
*  Apple realizes that their products could be blacklisted. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3442.7s)]
*  I mean, Facebook is blacklisted. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3447.98s)]
*  Google is blacklisted. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3449.4199999999996s)]
*  This is not some idle threat. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3450.46s)]
*  And Xi Jinping makes it really clear right through his various mechanisms. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3452.02s)]
*  And the party leads everything when I'm saying Xi. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3456.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, if Beijing's doing something, it's Xi Jinping. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3458.06s)]
*  You can be pretty damn sure about that. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3460.5s)]
*  And so there's all sorts of like antitrust investigations. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3462.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. So there's this Reuters report where 30 companies are called in. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3464.66s)]
*  There's going to be antitrust investigations of all of them. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3467.66s)]
*  And the quote from the official is, if you put up a fight, we could double or triple [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3470.2999999999997s)]
*  your fines. The example that I really like to cite is Qualcomm. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3473.8599999999997s)]
*  Qualcomm is like a chips architect in California. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3477.22s)]
*  Right. It's worth hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3479.18s)]
*  It's instrumental behind 3G, 4G and 5G technology. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3481.3399999999997s)]
*  Every phone you've ever used has Qualcomm inside. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3484.54s)]
*  And China just wants a lower rate on all of the licensing fees that that that [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3488.8599999999997s)]
*  Qualcomm is given for every phone that's made. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3494.06s)]
*  And what are they supposed to do? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3496.7s)]
*  I mean, China is basically demanding that Qualcomm launch joint ventures in the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3498.7s)]
*  country. And after three years, Qualcomm eventually just pays them a billion [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3502.62s)]
*  dollars, biggest fine in corporate history for China, and sets up a joint venture. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3506.02s)]
*  And a joint venture is what Beijing always wants. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3510.7s)]
*  Basically, a Western company comes in and the order of business is half this [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3512.7799999999997s)]
*  corporation is going to be Chinese so that we learn everything you know. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3516.9399999999996s)]
*  We learn the ins and outs and then we'll replicate your operations and eventually [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3520.2599999999998s)]
*  probably oust you. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3523.58s)]
*  Apple, interestingly, is able to get away with not doing joint ventures for a long [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3525.46s)]
*  time. But this is the context for when Xi Jinping enters the conversation, right, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3528.8199999999997s)]
*  or becomes president, that Apple looks like an exploitative force. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3533.22s)]
*  Because if you look at something like the Foxconn margins, Apple goes like from [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3537.38s)]
*  one percent margins in the early 2000s to 25 percent by 2012 and Foxconn's [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3541.9s)]
*  collapse by two thirds, three quarters. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3546.94s)]
*  And so it's like, wait a minute, aren't you guys working in tandem to build the [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3549.1800000000003s)]
*  iPhone? Why is Foxconn being treated so poorly? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3551.9s)]
*  And so the fascinating, most thesis driven narrative of the of the book is that [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3554.26s)]
*  Apple appoints eight people. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3558.06s)]
*  They call themselves the Gang of Eight. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3559.9s)]
*  These are the first senior people living in the country and they sort of oversee [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3561.58s)]
*  everything, procurement, operations, retail, third party sales, Apple University. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3565.94s)]
*  And they come up with a sort of new like method or like way of speaking with Beijing. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3570.7000000000003s)]
*  They speak the local languages, sort of how I put it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3577.3s)]
*  So the first time you've got people running government affairs in China at a high [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3580.5s)]
*  level for Apple and they realize we need to flip this narrative on its head. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3583.58s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3587.7400000000002s)]
*  So sorry. So they they need to flip this narrative on its head. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3589.42s)]
*  And so they sort of acknowledge and Tim Cook goes to Jiangnanhai in May 2016. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3592.3s)]
*  This is like the White House of China and issues this memorandum of understanding [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3596.7000000000003s)]
*  where they're going to invest two hundred and seventy five billion dollars over five [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3601.7000000000003s)]
*  years. So it's just an insane level of spending. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3605.5800000000004s)]
*  And what they're telling them is it's true that we don't have joint ventures. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3609.0200000000004s)]
*  Like it's true that Samsung has something like thirty five joint ventures at the time [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3612.78s)]
*  and we have zero. But you don't understand, we are orchestrating events across [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3615.94s)]
*  hundreds of factories and we are training your factories. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3621.22s)]
*  And your whole goal is indigenous innovation. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3625.2999999999997s)]
*  Like there's this idea called Made in China 2025 of how Beijing is going to like have [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3628.7799999999997s)]
*  companies move up the value chain and become self-sufficient in robotics and automation [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3633.3399999999997s)]
*  and everything. And Apple, this is obviously my language, not theirs, realizes, oh, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3637.06s)]
*  we're actually the biggest supporter of Made in China 2025. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3641.54s)]
*  So if we just speak their language and tell them, here's how much we invest, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3646.3399999999997s)]
*  then Beijing is going to understand and appreciate just what an impact Apple is having [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3651.58s)]
*  on the country. Essentially, since they've done that, they haven't had major problems [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3655.3799999999997s)]
*  in the country. They certainly haven't feared that the products are going to be [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3659.54s)]
*  blacklisted. And it's because Beijing realizes what an asset it is to have Apple [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3661.94s)]
*  operating there because they're working on such a scale with such perfectionist [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3666.54s)]
*  tendencies that the technology transfer embedded or engendered in their processes, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3670.46s)]
*  their operations are hugely beneficial to China. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3675.06s)]
*  You quote this tech industry analyst in the book, I think his name is Horace [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3678.98s)]
*  Dediu. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3683.66s)]
*  And he writes this. It's hard to reconcile the fact that the world's greatest [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3685.9s)]
*  American company, the most capitalist thing in the world, survives on the basis [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3690.8599999999997s)]
*  of a country that has communists in his title. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3695.9s)]
*  Yeah. Like. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3698.74s)]
*  We sort of talked around it, but I want you to really spell out the national [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3701.8599999999997s)]
*  security risk that comes from this seemingly symbiotic relationship. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3706.3s)]
*  So the jargon that gets that gets used is dual use technology. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3712.38s)]
*  In other words, if you're working with electronics and semiconductors and stuff, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3716.02s)]
*  that can be used for sexy iPhones. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3719.42s)]
*  It can also be used for drones and military weaponry. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3721.26s)]
*  So if you have been training our biggest adversary with cutting edge electronics [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3724.46s)]
*  over the last 25 years, you're actually up arming their military means by the same [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3729.2200000000003s)]
*  token. So the national security implication, I think, is massive. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3734.82s)]
*  And so like right now, the business ties between Apple and China are unbreakable. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3739.54s)]
*  I mean, there's no place else that they could go do this stuff. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3743.7000000000003s)]
*  And yet politically, I don't know how we accept this at all. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3746.42s)]
*  I mean, can we really have for the next 20 years Apple hiring the best engineers out [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3749.54s)]
*  of the best universities and having them go teach the most cutting edge techniques [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3753.42s)]
*  on unimaginable scale to China? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3757.3s)]
*  I mean, that's what I had to grapple with for the two years of writing this book. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3759.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that's insane. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3762.38s)]
*  But that's the reality. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3764.02s)]
*  It is the reality. And it's not it's not a reality that's going to shift anytime soon. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3765.22s)]
*  Supply chains move real slow. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3769.1s)]
*  So. You could look at what Trump is doing, or at least, you know, let's let's put the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3771.06s)]
*  tariffs to the side for a second, but certainly the language of the past hundred or so [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3776.66s)]
*  days about decoupling and things that were not really being discussed under the Biden [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3781.58s)]
*  administration are all of a sudden taking sort of center stage that this is not [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3786.7s)]
*  forgetting Apple. Apple is a piece of it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3791.34s)]
*  But this interconnected relationship with an authoritarian regime that is threatening [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3793.3s)]
*  Taiwan and doing all kinds of other things we don't have time to get into. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3800.1800000000003s)]
*  This is not a tenable situation. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3803.46s)]
*  We need to decouple from China. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3805.1800000000003s)]
*  What do people mean when they say that? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3807.5800000000004s)]
*  And given your research just on this one particular company, do you think that's [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3809.5400000000004s)]
*  actually something that's possible for us? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3814.2200000000003s)]
*  So I'm not optimistic and I wish I was. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3818.1000000000004s)]
*  But if there was some simple answer to the issues that I've raised, my book wouldn't be [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3820.66s)]
*  compelling because they would just you would just say, oh, well, they're moving to [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3824.62s)]
*  India. So problem solved. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3827.7000000000003s)]
*  That's not really happening at all. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3829.5s)]
*  People think that it's happening. It's not. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3831.82s)]
*  We can get into it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3833.34s)]
*  I mean, one thing that's worth knowing is China has been de-risking decoupling from the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3834.94s)]
*  U.S. since at least 2012, 2013. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3838.62s)]
*  You've probably heard of the Belt and Road Initiative. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3841.3s)]
*  Of course. Right. This is a massive effort to basically like create greater links with a [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3843.14s)]
*  whole portion of the non-Western world. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3847.58s)]
*  That's de-risking. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3849.66s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Africa, but also, you know, Kazakhstan and a whole bunch of nations around [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3851.02s)]
*  there, like the former Silk Road and such. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3854.82s)]
*  I mean, that is China's attempt to make sure that it is not so dependent on just [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3856.66s)]
*  exporting to Europe and just exporting to America. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3861.98s)]
*  In other words, China is in a much better position in Trump 2.0 than Trump 1.0 because [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3864.34s)]
*  they've already been de-risking from the West for the last eight years. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3869.1s)]
*  Have we been doing anything equivalent? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3872.46s)]
*  I know that there's no Belt and Road Initiative in America, but have we been [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3875.62s)]
*  de-risking in any way? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3879.02s)]
*  Not on the same scale at all. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3880.7000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, my expertise is more for Apple. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3882.46s)]
*  So people have this sense that something like 25 percent of iPhones are now made in [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3884.26s)]
*  India. Right. This is like totally understandable why someone thinks this. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3888.2200000000003s)]
*  But this is Apple orchestrating this conversation and there's no real substance [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3892.7400000000002s)]
*  behind it. It's just spin. It's total spin. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3896.0600000000004s)]
*  So if they just to set the stage for people, those those people that are very [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3898.2200000000003s)]
*  concerned about what it means to be so integrated with China, with Apple and [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3903.94s)]
*  everything else, are looking for, you know, hope in some other place. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3908.46s)]
*  Right. So these these goods that we are so relying on. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3914.34s)]
*  Oh, it's OK. They'll go to Mexico. They're going to India and so on. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3917.78s)]
*  So that's the context for this. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3920.1s)]
*  Yeah. And so to be clear, like politically or what have you, I would love if this [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3921.2200000000003s)]
*  were the reality. You know, setting up a bifurcated supply chain with like a [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3924.78s)]
*  totally independent, you know, supply chain all the way down to raw materials [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3928.3s)]
*  and stuff. If that's sort of being done in India over the next 20, 30 years [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3931.7400000000002s)]
*  because they're more of an ally, like I love that idea. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3935.66s)]
*  Here's why it's not happening. If there are a thousand steps in making the iPhone [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3938.74s)]
*  and the final step is now being done in India for a quarter of the world's [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3942.22s)]
*  iPhones. Congratulations. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3945.58s)]
*  You've avoided tariffs on China. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3947.54s)]
*  Have you de-risked your supply chain at all? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3949.14s)]
*  No, no. So if for some reason. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3951.3399999999997s)]
*  Is that what's literally happening, that the final step is happening in India? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3953.9s)]
*  Yeah. So it's called FATP, Final Assembly Test and Pack. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3956.98s)]
*  And that's what's now happening in India. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3959.62s)]
*  Now, Apple does have a more of a long term plan to do more of the depth [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3961.3399999999997s)]
*  and breadth of component manufacturing and raw material mining and everything [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3965.58s)]
*  outside of, sorry, beyond FATP in India. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3969.14s)]
*  But people think that's happening now. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3972.94s)]
*  And it really isn't. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3975.06s)]
*  There needs to be a massive acceleration in that regard. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3976.8999999999996s)]
*  So, yeah, if you buy an iPhone next year in America, very good chance the box [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3980.94s)]
*  is made in India. But that phone will be no less dependent on the China [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3985.2599999999998s)]
*  central supply chain than every other phone you've used. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3989.1s)]
*  This is what you write about China versus India. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3991.1800000000003s)]
*  You say China's top down ambitions were aided by docile, hardworking [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3993.34s)]
*  laborers systematically exploited by the state. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=3998.06s)]
*  By contrast, India's government is fragmented and less powerful. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4001.06s)]
*  The subtext, the subtext there, of course, is that China is the only country, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4004.34s)]
*  I'll say culturally, but you could say governmentally equipped to manufacture [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4009.26s)]
*  products at this level. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4013.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the reason India is part of the conversation is that it's the only [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4014.86s)]
*  country in the world with a billion plus people and rates of labor that [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4018.54s)]
*  frankly compare to China in the early 2000s. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4022.98s)]
*  So in a really superficial sense, you think, well, that sounds perfect. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4025.58s)]
*  But the more you look at it sort of substantially, the more you realize this [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4029.74s)]
*  probably isn't going to work. So, for instance, going back to the floating [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4033.58s)]
*  population discussion and such like that's really sort of the secret sauce [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4036.74s)]
*  of why China's manufacturing sector works so well that you have people. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4041.58s)]
*  And the reason they're systematically exploited, by the way, goes back to the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4044.66s)]
*  fact that they can't actually have permanent residents in these cities and [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4047.06s)]
*  such. So I'm not really applying the exploitation to Apple per se. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4049.94s)]
*  It's China. They have a dual class citizen structure [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4053.66s)]
*  within the country. There is no equivalent of that migratory pattern within [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4057.94s)]
*  India. There is no equivalent of young women going to work in factories outside [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4062.7s)]
*  the city of their of their home. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4066.94s)]
*  Right. Why is outside the scope of my book. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4068.74s)]
*  But when there was a study of 80 countries looking at migratory patterns, India was [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4072.7s)]
*  80th, 80th. So you don't have the same culture. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4076.74s)]
*  And the reason I mentioned women is because the tasks that [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4081.3399999999997s)]
*  are often being done to make iPhones require little fingers. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4086.8599999999997s)]
*  So the fact that it's young Chinese women with little fingers like that actually [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4091.3799999999997s)]
*  matters, like Apple engineers, we'll talk about this. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4094.62s)]
*  Isn't the great white hope here not India or Mexico or Canada or wherever, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4097.42s)]
*  but robotics and AI? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4103.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So unfortunately, this is harder than like this sounds like this would be [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4105.740000000001s)]
*  the obvious answer. Yeah. Literally like tiny little tasks like that's something [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4110.700000000001s)]
*  you imagine a robot. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4114.9400000000005s)]
*  OK. So for starters, anything that can be automated in iPhone production is [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4116.740000000001s)]
*  already automated. Right. Like there's insane levels of automation across the [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4120.66s)]
*  Apple ecosystem. So they're doing loads of that. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4124.14s)]
*  Among the problems are that it's easier to automate something like a car because [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4127.18s)]
*  you traditionally sort of design a car and then you're building it for like seven [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4131.5s)]
*  years. Right. So like I have a RAV4 from 2019. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4134.46s)]
*  The RAV4 is coming off the line today are not different. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4137.26s)]
*  The iPhones are. Great car. Nelly loves that car. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4140.26s)]
*  Yes, it is. It's perfect car for non-car people is how Doug Demuro puts it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4142.26s)]
*  So but the iPhone, at least certainly under the Johnny Ive era, I mean, you know, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4146.58s)]
*  you can be critical of Apple now, but they're trying to sort of redesign the [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4150.42s)]
*  phone every year. Every time they redesign it with different cameras and [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4153.3s)]
*  different modules inside, the automation is sort of reset. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4156.02s)]
*  Right. So it's one thing to set up the automation to do one thing and then have [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4159.02s)]
*  it running for seven years. It's different with Apple because they really [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4162.42s)]
*  have like the preponderance of production in like the first six months of an iPhone [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4165.9400000000005s)]
*  going on sale, like September to March. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4169.18s)]
*  And then they're redesigning it. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4171.26s)]
*  And so you'd have to reset up all the automation and stuff. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4172.9s)]
*  So it's true that you could say, oh, but what about like artificial general [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4175.46s)]
*  intelligence? If that comes on board, can machines be sort of thinking more [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4178.42s)]
*  smartly to do this thing on their own? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4181.42s)]
*  OK, let's just say that's the case. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4183.26s)]
*  And we can be really optimistic about that. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4184.9s)]
*  Even so, where are the raw minerals coming from? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4186.7s)]
*  Who's refining all the copper, all the lithium, et cetera, that's needed? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4189.7s)]
*  That's still all happening in China. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4193.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. So even if the minerals are coming from Africa, it's Chinese companies and [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4195.0199999999995s)]
*  then they're refining it all in China. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4198.26s)]
*  So like the steps needed, even if automation is indeed the future and that [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4200.62s)]
*  were some sort of guarantee and you didn't need the labor force that we talk about [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4205.0199999999995s)]
*  for the last 25 years, it's still the case that China has enormous advantages. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4208.38s)]
*  They have more robots than us. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4212.82s)]
*  They have more automation than us. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4214.0199999999995s)]
*  And the machines that they already have set up on their production lines are just [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4215.46s)]
*  like like experts find it difficult to even understand the depth and like [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4218.54s)]
*  superiority of Chinese manufacturing. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4223.54s)]
*  So you're completely bearish on the idea of decoupling, especially when it comes to [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4225.78s)]
*  Apple products. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4229.58s)]
*  It's one of those things where I would love to be wrong. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4230.74s)]
*  Like everything in my being is pushing me towards an optimistic thing. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4232.9s)]
*  I'm like happy Golden Retriever Canadian. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4236.1s)]
*  Like I'm not a pessimistic person, but I've spoken to so many people and it [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4238.3s)]
*  just it's just not going to work. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4243.26s)]
*  So. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4245.34s)]
*  Well, then where is this going to go? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4248.06s)]
*  Because you're making the argument that this is an untenable situation from a [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4249.58s)]
*  national security perspective. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4253.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's put aside everything else. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4255.38s)]
*  Where does this where does this go? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4257.74s)]
*  So one answer is just the status quo. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4259.34s)]
*  So nothing changes. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4261.46s)]
*  And most people aren't aware of what I'm calling politically untenable. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4263.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. I mean, most people, you know, whether it's senators or congressmen or [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4267.1s)]
*  whatever, they're not familiar with how Apple is having this nation building like [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4270.78s)]
*  influence on China, specifically in the thing Xi Jinping wants most, which is [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4274.94s)]
*  the electronic sector. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4280.54s)]
*  Right. That dominance. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4281.82s)]
*  So, you know, to some extent, I'm obviously hoping my book makes a splash and that [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4283.259999999999s)]
*  people understand that. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4286.98s)]
*  And so I'm, you know, I guess I'm shooting myself in the foot in terms of what that [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4288.66s)]
*  policy implication is, because the more people that become aware of what I'm [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4292.7s)]
*  arguing, the less likely it is that we can maintain the status quo. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4296.259999999999s)]
*  But if status quo is the answer, it could work in the sense that, you know, American [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4299.86s)]
*  continues doing what it does best, software, artificial intelligence, and it [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4304.78s)]
*  outsources all the hardware to China. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4308.5s)]
*  The problem with that is the Chinese have become so good at learning and absorbing [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4310.34s)]
*  everything Apple has taught them that the world's best phones today are not iPhones. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4316.7s)]
*  Huawei makes better phones. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4320.46s)]
*  Huawei makes a phone that's a little bit thicker than an iPhone, but it unfolds twice [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4322.219999999999s)]
*  into a 10.2 inch tablet tablet equivalent of an iPad. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4326.66s)]
*  And it has tremendously good cameras and stuff. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4330.219999999999s)]
*  Now, it goes for twenty eight hundred dollars and critics have derided it and saying, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4332.62s)]
*  well, this is, you know, like a way too expensive phone. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4336.18s)]
*  But can you imagine in 2014 hearing that there was a Chinese phone that wasn't just [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4338.66s)]
*  imitating the best iPhone features, but it was better and it was actually luxurious. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4342.7s)]
*  Right. And this is what's happening in the world as well, where it's not that, you [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4346.86s)]
*  know, the Chinese D.V.'s are just undercutting like the Ford, you know, like the [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4350.58s)]
*  Chevrolet Bolt or something. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4354.46s)]
*  They're undercutting Porsche. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4355.7s)]
*  So the Chinese have really learned everything they need to know and have become [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4358.06s)]
*  just better at this stuff. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4362.9800000000005s)]
*  So even before Trump came on board, Biden slapped 100 percent tariffs on EVs. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4364.18s)]
*  And just to sort of revert this back to the original discussion, the like slang term [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4369.02s)]
*  for an EV is an iPhone on wheels. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4374.1s)]
*  Right. And so think of all the training that I'm talking about that went into all the [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4376.42s)]
*  suppliers. Well, those suppliers took what they knew and they applied it to an EV. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4381.14s)]
*  Right. So Apple's influence on how Chinese build cars is also like difficult to [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4386.18s)]
*  understate. Here's the upshot of what I'm hearing you say. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4392.42s)]
*  Not only are you saying that the possibility of manufacturing the most important [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4395.78s)]
*  phone in the world, let's leave the Huawei one to the side, is never going to happen [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4401.22s)]
*  outside of China in our lifetimes. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4405.7s)]
*  More than that, you're saying that the idea of decoupling is not really possible, even [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4407.82s)]
*  though the current relationship constitutes a national security threat. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4413.18s)]
*  What I hear you saying is that you haven't said it quite this way, but that China has [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4417.9800000000005s)]
*  the upper hand and that if you were to characterize who is going to dominate or bet [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4422.62s)]
*  on who is going to dominate the 21st century, it's probably not America, but it's [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4427.780000000001s)]
*  China. I think we've got way too much emphasis on when China is going to outmatch [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4432.1s)]
*  America in GDP. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  That's not what I'm talking about, though. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4437.62s)]
*  I'm not talking about GDP. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4439.06s)]
*  I'm saying who has the upper hand? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4440.38s)]
*  Because throughout this conversation, if you turn back time to 2001 or whatever, we [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4442.9400000000005s)]
*  did. But now I think what I'm hearing you say at least is that China does. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4450.7s)]
*  We are dependent on China. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4455.34s)]
*  And not only that, the cost of our dependence has been paying them hundreds of billions [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4457.42s)]
*  of dollars to allow them to have the know-how to go and take it to all kinds of [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4464.46s)]
*  applications that we have no idea about. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4469.26s)]
*  I mean, if China were for some reason to cut America off from exports for a month, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4471.62s)]
*  I mean, it would be absolute chaos in the streets. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4476.34s)]
*  Now, they have reasons why they wouldn't do that. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4478.66s)]
*  Their economy is dependent on manufacturing and exporting stuff to the West. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4480.38s)]
*  But it's a considerable risk that we don't have a plan B if they were to exercise [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4484.14s)]
*  that. Like China has weaponized its supply chain to a certain degree, but they've [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4489.7s)]
*  never gone all out. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4493.780000000001s)]
*  But the idea that they could, I mean, that's when our dependency would be like [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4495.14s)]
*  crazily exposed. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4498.82s)]
*  I want to make one correction. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4500.94s)]
*  I didn't say iPhones could not be built outside of China sort of ever. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4502.0599999999995s)]
*  I said they can never be built in the U.S. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4505.259999999999s)]
*  Certainly not the quantity that we build them. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4506.94s)]
*  I do think they could be done in India. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4508.62s)]
*  I just don't think Apple is making the necessary investments to make that happen. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4510.62s)]
*  Why not, though? Why aren't they doing it? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4513.62s)]
*  Yeah, because they're already winning the PR battle because most of our listeners [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4515.5s)]
*  think that 25 percent of iPhones are made in India, right? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4518.219999999999s)]
*  Not making the distinction between they're assembled there, but they're not really [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4521.34s)]
*  made there in any meaningful sense. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4524.099999999999s)]
*  So Apple is great doing this great PR battle where they're not really moving to [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4526.0199999999995s)]
*  India, but people think that they are, which means legally they're avoiding [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4530.38s)]
*  tariffs in the popular imagination. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4534.099999999999s)]
*  They're de-risking from China, but they're OK with Beijing because Beijing is too [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4536.259999999999s)]
*  smart. They know the processes. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4540.54s)]
*  They know that they're not actually moving from China. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4542.219999999999s)]
*  Now, if India, sorry, if Apple did what I said they should do, right, was really [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4544.38s)]
*  accelerate their production, the depth, the breadth of manufacturing all the way [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4548.5s)]
*  down to raw materials in India, they would immediately face a problem with Beijing. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  Beijing is not going to allow that. Beijing wants technology transfer to be a [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4556.34s)]
*  one way gate. It enters China. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4559.099999999999s)]
*  It doesn't leave. And so if you're Beijing or you're a provincial official and you [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4560.66s)]
*  don't like the new press release that more phones are going to be made in India, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4565.0199999999995s)]
*  maybe electricity goes out at a certain factory on a random Wednesday and they [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4568.7s)]
*  don't have to say anything. Apple engineers would just be put in the position of, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4572.54s)]
*  huh, guys, do we think the factory went out of electricity because of that India [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4575.86s)]
*  press release? And they would be left wondering. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4579.98s)]
*  And then they would question whether they should be moving to India. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4583.740000000001s)]
*  So China really has Apple over a barrel here. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4586.38s)]
*  And if they make any big pronounced moves. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4589.9800000000005s)]
*  Their risk would be exposed. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4594.3s)]
*  I mean, they're just it's difficult to overstate how vulnerable Apple is. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4595.700000000001s)]
*  Can you talk about the position of Tim Cook that Tim Cook is in right now and [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4599.700000000001s)]
*  trying to please Trump and also trying to stay on the good side of Xi? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4604.38s)]
*  Analyze his position strategically a little bit, because I think it's really [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4609.02s)]
*  fascinating. It's interesting that you would assume, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4612.740000000001s)]
*  I think, that Xi Jinping represents the biggest risk to China. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4619.34s)]
*  And certainly, even if you were thinking of what I said the last hour, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4625.14s)]
*  that's probably where you would go. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4627.700000000001s)]
*  Trump is a bigger threat. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4629.26s)]
*  Right. Because Xi Jinping does want Apple to be creating in China. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4631.540000000001s)]
*  Trump doesn't. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4635.660000000001s)]
*  So when Trump. What does he want? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4637.46s)]
*  Well, Trump wants it all built in America. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4638.98s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, I don't think you have to be all that ideological to say [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4640.58s)]
*  that Trump doesn't know much about supply chains. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4644.58s)]
*  I mean, even his own branded ties and stuff are made in China. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4646.7s)]
*  Like he gets that that's where you build stuff. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4649.38s)]
*  So he's been asking Tim Cook essentially for close to a decade now to be building [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4651.42s)]
*  in America. And Tim Cook has been, you know, like astute in telling Trump what he [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4655.3s)]
*  wants to hear that we are going to build in America. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4661.099999999999s)]
*  But he's not following through. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4663.5s)]
*  And he's obfuscating various things. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4664.82s)]
*  So, for instance, but it's worked. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4666.38s)]
*  Right. So, like, I love that the free press has all sorts of political contributors [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4667.9s)]
*  and like, you know, they can make me angry and stuff, but I really like the discussion. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4671.259999999999s)]
*  But Batya, right, thinks that Apple is investing 500 billion dollars to reinvent [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4674.259999999999s)]
*  American manufacturing. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4679.099999999999s)]
*  And like, sorry, Batya, it ain't happening. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4680.58s)]
*  It's an Apple press release. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4682.38s)]
*  But you're drinking the Kool-Aid if you think that's what's happening. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4683.78s)]
*  Just anyone listening, do the math, go find the Apple press release and you tell me in [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4686.3s)]
*  a back of the envelope way if you can even get to 50 billion dollars based on the [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4691.78s)]
*  announcements. Right. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4695.78s)]
*  And Apple's saying 500 billion dollars for four years. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4696.98s)]
*  If that's the case, why aren't I seeing Apple jobs here, there and everywhere for [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4699.78s)]
*  like a dozen different plants? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4703.38s)]
*  Like the literal the press release literally says 500 billion dollars and we're going [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4705.0199999999995s)]
*  to create 20,000 jobs. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4708.54s)]
*  How bad would a government program have to be to spend 500 billion dollars to [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4710.0199999999995s)]
*  generate 20,000 jobs? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4715.0199999999995s)]
*  It's ludicrous. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4716.66s)]
*  Now, this is opinion. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4717.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4718.66s)]
*  The fact here, my assumption, because the only way I can make the math work is that [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4719.66s)]
*  Apple is counting as investment in America, buybacks and dividends. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4723.62s)]
*  In other words, the thing that it already does and people just don't understand how [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4727.86s)]
*  big Apple is. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4731.3s)]
*  Apple buys back their own shares. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4732.3s)]
*  Right. This is way of sort of like inflating their own stock price and making executives [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4733.9s)]
*  look good. They don't know what to do with their money. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4737.139999999999s)]
*  They've got so much money. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4738.9s)]
*  They're buying 100 billion dollars of their own shares per year. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4740.22s)]
*  That's equivalent to all buybacks from Wall Street's top six banks combined. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4743.099999999999s)]
*  So they're operating on a scale that like nobody is operating on. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4748.02s)]
*  I would advocate they have that to investors, tell them to suck it up and they spend 50 [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4751.26s)]
*  dollars a year on supply chain resiliency and actually do more in America, do more in [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4755.5s)]
*  India. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4759.46s)]
*  But they're winning the PR battle right now because most people think they are spending [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4760.660000000001s)]
*  500 billion dollars in the US. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4763.26s)]
*  But if you just scrutinize that, just think of Apple just as a thought experiment. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4766.1s)]
*  Say this isn't a credible company. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4770.42s)]
*  I'm going to read this in a really scrutinized way. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4772.540000000001s)]
*  You'll understand that the press release is, you know, just ridiculously misleading. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4774.9s)]
*  What if the president said to the American people, hey, guys, I know we all love our [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4784.0599999999995s)]
*  iPhones, but they're going to cost three thousand dollars a pop now because it's too [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4789.259999999999s)]
*  much of a national security threat to have them built in China. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4793.62s)]
*  What do you think the reaction would be? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4796.74s)]
*  So I know where you're getting the figure, right? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4798.0599999999995s)]
*  Because this analyst put out that if you built them in America, they cost 3500. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4799.42s)]
*  Do you think that's wrong? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4803.3s)]
*  I think it's completely wrong. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4804.3s)]
*  Everyone. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4805.3s)]
*  What do you think the real price is? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4806.3s)]
*  Everyone quotes this line because I literally don't know of another analyst who's come [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4807.3s)]
*  up with another. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  What do you think the real price is? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4809.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think there is a price. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think they can be built here. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4811.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, not in the quantities. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4814.38s)]
*  Again, 230 million iPhones are built a year. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4815.38s)]
*  I mean, it's just an astonishing number. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4818.9800000000005s)]
*  Like someone asked me at a talk the other day, well, Toyota does a really good job, you [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4821.38s)]
*  know, building cars in America. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4825.66s)]
*  What lessons can Apple learn from Toyota? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4827.38s)]
*  And it's like Toyota, I don't know. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4829.780000000001s)]
*  Toyota makes 10 million cars a year. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4832.14s)]
*  Apple across this product portfolio does about half a billion. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4835.860000000001s)]
*  There's nothing that Toyota has to teach Apple. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4839.9400000000005s)]
*  Apple is operating on a scale that few companies can even imagine, let alone execute on a daily [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4842.700000000001s)]
*  basis. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4847.58s)]
*  You talked earlier in this conversation and you write in the book about how Apple sort [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4848.58s)]
*  of sleptwalked into this reality. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4853.740000000001s)]
*  Totally. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4856.06s)]
*  If Tim Cook were sitting here and you said to him, and I do hope you get to interview [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4857.06s)]
*  him at some point and never going to happen. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4861.38s)]
*  Why not? Could I? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4863.1s)]
*  I don't think he would sit down with me. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4864.14s)]
*  There's no chance. It could. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4865.3s)]
*  Lifes long. You have no idea. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4866.42s)]
*  Can I tell you one fun fact? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4867.900000000001s)]
*  While I was doing this research, I was delighted that everyone was writing about A.I. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4869.3s)]
*  and not touching the China hardware story whatsoever. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4872.62s)]
*  But there were three major interviews of Tim Cook in the last year, Vanity Fair, Wired [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4874.82s)]
*  and The Wall Street Journal. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4879.5s)]
*  China doesn't come up in any of those discussions. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4880.9400000000005s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4882.7s)]
*  Because we're not asking the right questions of Apple. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4883.7s)]
*  Everyone sort of like, you know, sort of lured in by the idea of their sexy products [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4887.06s)]
*  and like the journalist idea of a scoop about Apple is like a new product finding out [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4891.540000000001s)]
*  if the new product has curved corners or something. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4895.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4897.820000000001s)]
*  We're not we're totally ignoring the most existential, most important thing about the [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4899.26s)]
*  company's future. If someone were to succeed Tim Cook tomorrow, by far the most important [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4903.3s)]
*  thing for that person is de-risking from China and having some sort of resilience in the [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4907.700000000001s)]
*  supply chain. Far more so than what the next iPhone is going to look like or whether the [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4912.02s)]
*  Vision Pro is a success. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4915.74s)]
*  I don't know if he drinks or not, but let's assume you got him alone. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4916.94s)]
*  You're at a bar. Yes. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4919.66s)]
*  Really being honest with you. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4921.139999999999s)]
*  Do you think if you ask him the question, hey, Tim, if you could turn back time and do [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4923.58s)]
*  it differently, what would you do? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4928.58s)]
*  I have a good answer for this because a former senior vice president, I could probably name [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4930.58s)]
*  them, but I haven't cleared this by him, so I won't. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4935.62s)]
*  But he said, even if we knew what China was going to become in 2006, 2007, what would [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4937.46s)]
*  you have us do? It was still the case. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4943.42s)]
*  That China was the only place that could pull this stuff off. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4945.7s)]
*  I mean, because even if you're optimistic, I mean, what if the answer is sorry to interrupt [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4948.3s)]
*  Patrick, but like we're going to grow slower. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4951.98s)]
*  Like, I mean, seriously, like, well, sure. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4955.94s)]
*  Yeah. I think it would be a lot slower. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4959.42s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Or just the quality wouldn't be there because, you know, Nokia phones are [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4963.74s)]
*  being built in the tens of millions and the hundreds of millions. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4966.66s)]
*  But they were just sort of like shitty little plastic phones that were literally glued [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4970.099999999999s)]
*  together. They just weren't on the same scale because I'm emphasizing quantity. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4973.46s)]
*  But of course, the quality of Apple products is unparalleled. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4978.62s)]
*  But you're saying the people that you spoke to said we would do it all again. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4981.78s)]
*  They're saying there's no alternative. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4985.1s)]
*  That's another way of saying we'll do it all again. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4987.62s)]
*  Well, yeah. So, OK, so I have spoken to people with an Apple, right, who I've said to them, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4989.86s)]
*  this is as I'm quoting a concurrent employee. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4997.1s)]
*  And I said, what percentage of products will be built in India by 2030? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=4999.06s)]
*  And I nearly fell out of my seat because the person said 60 percent. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5003.5s)]
*  And I said more than in China, anyone? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5006.9s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think this person is really wrong. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5008.74s)]
*  But a bunch of other people with an Apple, when I said that to them, they agreed. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5012.7s)]
*  Right. They said that's plausible. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5016.9s)]
*  I think there's hubris at Apple. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5019.3s)]
*  I think they look back at the last 25 years and they say, look at what we did, pat [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5021.1s)]
*  themselves on the back and say, of course, we could do that in India. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5024.94s)]
*  There's not an understanding that China was a once in a century partner. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5027.3s)]
*  Right. They would build eight lane highways to and from factory cities. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5031.259999999999s)]
*  Right. They would create these bonded zones where there's all sorts of tax exemptions. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5035.58s)]
*  They would have this workforce that we've talked about that was just like unparalleled [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5039.58s)]
*  in terms of their diligence, their hard workiness, the hours that they would put in. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5043.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese government cares about manufacturing like nothing else. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5047.82s)]
*  And they would just buy the equipment, give away the land for free, et cetera. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5052.179999999999s)]
*  Like India is just not going to do that. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5055.86s)]
*  I don't care how powerful Apple is. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5057.78s)]
*  It can't change culture and it can't change the Indian government and how they work. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5059.94s)]
*  I mean, it's a fragmented country with God knows how many provinces and overlapping [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5064.34s)]
*  interests and competition and stuff. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5067.62s)]
*  Beijing has more of like we say it's law. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5069.62s)]
*  And so Apple was able to exploit that in insane ways. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5072.94s)]
*  So if iPhone production can be totally done in a different way, then maybe there's a [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5076.54s)]
*  way you can do it someplace else on that scale. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5080.9s)]
*  But if it's the same playbook of the last 25 years, I don't see how anyone's going to [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5083.219999999999s)]
*  compete with China. How do you think history will view? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5087.0199999999995s)]
*  Apple in this period, like a hundred years from now, if someone summarized this whole [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5090.34s)]
*  story in a few lines, what will those lines be? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5095.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if I have a goal, it's to totally upend your perception of Apple. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5098.0199999999995s)]
*  I apply this question really to Tim Cook. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5102.259999999999s)]
*  So the conclusion is called unwritten legacy. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5104.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm taking on the idea that Tim Cook is sort of a demigod of capitalism who deserves [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5107.179999999999s)]
*  to be exalted. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5113.34s)]
*  And I'm saying it in a sort of tenuous way. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5116.42s)]
*  I don't know where my own view of him is. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5118.58s)]
*  It's not a solid position. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5121.1s)]
*  But my comparison is that of Jack Welch. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5123.1s)]
*  Jack Welch was named manager of the century. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5125.54s)]
*  OK, hard to compete with that title in 2000. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5128.0599999999995s)]
*  But by the time he passed away five five years ago or so, his reputation had really [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5130.46s)]
*  changed and really changed because he led GE for 20 years before he retired in 2001. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5134.54s)]
*  You know, shareholder returns or something like 20 percent a year. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5139.66s)]
*  But, you know, by the time 2020 came around, the book about him was called The Man Who [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5142.74s)]
*  Broke Capitalism, because the more you replicated his strategy, the more you were [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5146.26s)]
*  outsourcing jobs. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5150.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, he once said he wanted production to be on a barge that would float around the [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5152.3s)]
*  world to wherever it was most convenient for tax purposes and stuff. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5155.46s)]
*  The more that got replicated, the more it became understood that like this is great [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5159.3s)]
*  for shareholders, but it's kind of coming at the expense of wider societal interests. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5162.780000000001s)]
*  And so GE really falls apart like within days of him retiring. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5167.42s)]
*  Literally, he retires and four days later is September 11th. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5174.1s)]
*  And GE was involved in insurance of like both twin towers. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5177.34s)]
*  And so they begin really struggling and it begins to be clear as the economy enters a [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5181.14s)]
*  tailspin that there are so-called synergies between these very disparate businesses were [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5185.26s)]
*  actually like a liability. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5189.26s)]
*  And then the 2008 financial crisis comes comes away and they'd use their triple A rating [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5190.5s)]
*  to basically like, you know, rubber stamp a bunch of investments and sort of lend it [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5194.9400000000005s)]
*  out in a way that came back to bite them. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5200.42s)]
*  So they were really heavily in the subprime mortgage crisis as using their balance sheet [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5201.9s)]
*  in ways that had nothing to do with like industry, its industrial history. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5206.78s)]
*  So anyway, my comparison is could Tim Cook's reputation suffer something like this? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5210.179999999999s)]
*  And like, of course it could. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5215.42s)]
*  Right. I mean, what would it I mean, if China invaded Taiwan tomorrow, it would be the [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5216.98s)]
*  equivalent of a meteor strike on Apple. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5220.86s)]
*  I mean, Apple would not only have no production coming out of China, all of its CPU chips [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5222.58s)]
*  are made in Taiwan, a tiny little island. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5226.86s)]
*  I quote someone saying that borderline malpractice, I'd be nervous as shit if I was on [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5229.46s)]
*  their board was the quote. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5233.660000000001s)]
*  So it just doesn't take much of an imagination to think about how this could go wrong. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5235.58s)]
*  Right. I quote someone saying Apple's relationship with China could blow up any day. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5241.780000000001s)]
*  So I don't know that it will blow up. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5246.42s)]
*  But if it does, I don't think you can say it wasn't foreseen. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5248.34s)]
*  It's been a risk for the last 20 years. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5253.18s)]
*  I can't believe we're not writing about it more often. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5255.22s)]
*  What's the thing that keeps you up at night lately? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5257.700000000001s)]
*  Well, the reception to the book, How Apple Might Respond. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5260.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, those those two things, how China might respond. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5266.580000000001s)]
*  What's the most important book you've read in the past five or so years? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5269.580000000001s)]
*  The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by David Lans or Landy's. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5272.9800000000005s)]
*  OK, late Harvard economist. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5276.9400000000005s)]
*  It's basically on the Industrial Revolution. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5278.46s)]
*  And he really made me understand just what a singular event that is. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5280.46s)]
*  And he's really trying to answer why did it happen when it did? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5284.66s)]
*  Why did it happen in Britain? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5287.34s)]
*  How long did it take for the lessons to permutate everywhere else? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5288.62s)]
*  And I think in its own way, it's really a story about technological transfer. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5291.9s)]
*  And so it really underpins my understanding of what China's been able to achieve the last 20 years. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5297.1s)]
*  So it's not from that book. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5303.1s)]
*  But I take a quote from David Landis as my opening epigraph. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5304.54s)]
*  Or we'll have you. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5308.66s)]
*  And tell us what that quote is. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5309.34s)]
*  Well, it's it's it's making an argument that it was know how in manufacturing [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5310.58s)]
*  that led to Britain being the empire that it that it was. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5317.7s)]
*  Given that America is has declined as a manufacturing nation. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5321.46s)]
*  And given what you said earlier in this conversation about manufacturing being sort of [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5326.9s)]
*  the key to nationhood, what does that mean about America's status as a nation? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5331.54s)]
*  So I think it's OK if we have an integrationist approach. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5336.82s)]
*  So like my master's thesis was called Allies and Ideals and it was about American military. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5340.1s)]
*  And he was saying that we should really leverage ideals that are looked up to around the world and our allies. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5345.34s)]
*  I think in a manufacturing sense, that would be fine. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5352.42s)]
*  I'm very pro friend shoring. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5354.34s)]
*  Do you think that Donald Trump should read that paper of yours? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5356.54s)]
*  He'd be like the sixth person to read it. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5360.5s)]
*  I do. Do you get the impression that he reads a lot of papers? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5363.780000000001s)]
*  I know I just the title seems like sort of the opposite of American foreign policy. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5366.7s)]
*  Oh, it very much is. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5371.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you know, obviously, I understand that if a manufacturing facility closes in Ohio and goes to Mexico, a lot of people are upset. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5372.26s)]
*  It is way better if that factory goes to Mexico than if it goes to China. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5380.18s)]
*  If it goes to Mexico, there's intermediary trade between the between the countries. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5383.66s)]
*  If it goes to China, like it's lost. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5387.78s)]
*  So it really matters to me that American manufacturers can do sort of more of the high end stuff, but like leverage NAFTA. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5390.22s)]
*  I'm very pro NAFTA. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5398.06s)]
*  Why are so many people embracing protectionism? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5399.3s)]
*  I think to some degree, we're just totally taking for granted what we have as normal and not understanding how how fragile civilization is and how abnormal our daily existence is here. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5402.06s)]
*  Free trade. Good. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5412.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5414.3s)]
*  Capitalism. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5414.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm a capitalist. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5416.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's no alternative. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5417.42s)]
*  Right. I mean, what will China showing that there is? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5419.5s)]
*  Well, I would call that a version of capitalism. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5421.9400000000005s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5424.5s)]
*  You want to say more? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5425.3s)]
*  It's state sponsored capitalism. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5426.18s)]
*  I mean, they're they're better at capitalism than we are. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5428.38s)]
*  Patrick McGee, thank you so much for coming out, honestly. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5431.66s)]
*  My pleasure. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q852nEpYJAo&t=5433.9s)]
