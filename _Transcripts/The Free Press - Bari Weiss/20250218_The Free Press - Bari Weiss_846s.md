A lot of people are wondering if things in Los Angeles would look different if Rick Caruso had won the mayoral race against Karen Bass in 2022. If he had been mayor when devastating fires began in the city last month, could he have prevented them from consuming about 40,000 acres—an area twice the size of Manhattan?

At the time Caruso ran, many quietly supported the billionaire real estate mogul—scared to come out publicly for the white Boomer billionaire against the candidate (a black woman and a former physician assistant who happened to travel to Cuba eight times in the 1970s) who was backed by Barack Obama and celebrities like Shonda Rhimes and Ariana Grande.

But disaster has a way of clarifying things. And many—including the LA Times owner whose paper endorsed Bass—are expressing serious buyer’s remorse.

Does this annoy Caruso? And does he think Bass won because of her identity? If the election were held today, would things have turned out differently?

Today on Honestly, Bari sits down with Rick Caruso for a very frank conversation.

# How California’s Leaders Caused the LA Fire Devastation | Former LA Mayoral Candidate Rick Caruso
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s)
*  There's this idea of luxury beliefs that's my friend Rob Henderson defined. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's basically in the same way that luxury goods confer status or affluence, luxury [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=6.04s)]
*  beliefs do the same. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=13.32s)]
*  So if you look at the past few years, the idea, let's say, of abolishing the police, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=14.52s)]
*  that became a high status idea to put out there in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=19.3s)]
*  But the very people that were articulating it are the kinds of people that live in neighborhoods [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=23.04s)]
*  with private security. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=27.9s)]
*  In other words, it's a luxury thing that they can afford to post the hashtag abolish the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  police precisely because they live in neighborhoods where they won't suffer the consequences of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=35.98s)]
*  those things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=41.339999999999996s)]
*  And people kind of went along with those ideas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  But the bill came due, I would argue, a few weeks ago when Los Angeles suffered with the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=44.94s)]
*  worst fire in the history of the city. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=54.42s)]
*  The worst fire in the history of the city. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=56.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=59.38s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the things that they had indulged without necessarily suffering [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=60.38s)]
*  the consequences of it, all of a sudden people were texting me all over Los Angeles saying, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  I can't believe I voted for Karen Bass, or I woke up the day after the fires and now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm a Republican, half jokingly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  But sincerely in the sense that I went along with a set of policies and ideas and politicians [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=80.02s)]
*  that I didn't suffer the consequences of. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, I'm suffering the consequences of incompetency and bad governance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if that's the kind of thing that you've been hearing over the past few weeks [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  and what you make of the people that, to steal a phrase, are waking up or maybe getting woke [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=99.22s)]
*  to reality. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm hearing that a lot. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=107.14s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=108.14s)]
*  I'm hearing it a lot in Los Angeles. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=109.14s)]
*  Again, sort of put your listeners and viewers, given the context, the area that's been devastated, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=111.94s)]
*  that's been burned out is two and a half times the size of Manhattan in New York. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=119.42s)]
*  It is difficult to get your head around even when you drive through it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=124.74s)]
*  It's so devastating. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=130.38s)]
*  It literally looks like it was carpet bombed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=131.7s)]
*  I do think that people woke up with a very different feeling about their leadership, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=136.14s)]
*  woke up about their priorities. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=141.7s)]
*  And this is very personal to me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=144.18s)]
*  It's personal because I love this city. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=147.26s)]
*  It's personal because my son and my daughter lost a home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=150.1s)]
*  It's personal to me because these two wonderful communities, Alta Dena and the Palisades, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=154.62s)]
*  it's more about losing your home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=161.5s)]
*  They lost their lifestyle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=162.9s)]
*  They lost their gathering places, churches, schools, parks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=164.5s)]
*  Everything's gone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=168.7s)]
*  And to me, the level of incompetence of the leadership, both elected and appointed, is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=170.42s)]
*  like nothing I've ever seen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=178.74s)]
*  And everybody is paying a huge price for it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=180.82s)]
*  And nobody yet, which boggles my mind, has stood up and said, I take responsibility and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=184.46s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=193.3s)]
*  Who are the people that should be standing up and doing exactly that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=194.3s)]
*  Well, the first in line should be Karen Bass. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  And then down from her, the head of DWP that allowed the reservoir that backs up and fills [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=202.34s)]
*  up the water for the fire hydrants was empty. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  And literally the fire department ran out of water. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=212.58s)]
*  The second largest city in the country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  How the hell do you run out of water in your fire hydrants? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=217.22000000000003s)]
*  She should be fired immediately. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=220.66s)]
*  And it goes from there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=224.18s)]
*  The fire department was not pre-deployed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  We had a fire three weeks ago. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=227.66s)]
*  The catastrophic winds. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=230.62s)]
*  There was notices going out to everybody about how deadly, quote unquote, these winds were [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=232.94s)]
*  going to be. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=238.06s)]
*  You had 40 years of brush that had never been managed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=239.38s)]
*  So you had all of these facts coming together. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=243.18s)]
*  It was predictable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=246.26s)]
*  What I've said before was predictable is preventable and we just weren't prepared for it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  And that's wrong. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=253.14s)]
*  And people should be held accountable for it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=254.42s)]
*  Now, I've been very clear in my criticism, Barry, as you know, and I also do want to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=256.5s)]
*  give people hope because I'm very hopeful looking forward and we can talk about that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  But, you know, what's happened happened. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=267.42s)]
*  People should be held accountable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=271.94s)]
*  But now the focus and my focus is let's get people back in their community, back in their [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=273.38s)]
*  homes, back in their schools, back in their synagogues, back in their churches. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  And I'm going to work my ass off every day to do it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=282.58s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=285.9s)]
*  I want to get there because, you know, as you know, I'm married to a seventh generation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=287.86s)]
*  Californian. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=291.58s)]
*  California is in her blood. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=292.78s)]
*  She has made me fall in love with the state and I'm also long California. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  But I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the reality of how the fires happened, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=298.54s)]
*  because for people who don't live in L.A., who don't live in these communities, there's a lot [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=304.7s)]
*  of information, like the information flow around how this devastation happened is very [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=310.14s)]
*  confusing because there's a lot of fake news out there and information that it's unclear if it's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=316.58s)]
*  true or conspiracy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=322.38s)]
*  So, you know what happened better than just about anybody. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=323.58s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=329.02s)]
*  As you just said before, you can't prevent deadly winds. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=330.74s)]
*  California in many ways is, I don't want to say built to burn, but it's the kind of environment [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=335.3s)]
*  where fires happen, where earthquakes happen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=340.14s)]
*  These things happen. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=343.7s)]
*  They are not preventable. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=345.02s)]
*  What is preventable is preparation for them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=346.14s)]
*  So, explain to people that have not been following the ins and outs of everything in the way that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=349.42s)]
*  you have, like big picture, how did this level of devastation happen? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=356.58s)]
*  How did it come to be that an area two and a half times the size of Manhattan burned to the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=362.18s)]
*  ground? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=367.1s)]
*  Well, it starts with we had no management of the hillsides with the brush. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=369.02s)]
*  And like I said, that had been there for 40 years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=374.98s)]
*  Six years ago, our home is in Brentwood, which is about 15 minutes from the Palisades. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=377.22s)]
*  Six years ago, we had a fire near Brentwood on the 405 freeway. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=382.26000000000005s)]
*  And at the time, very sadly, I said to my wife and my kids, because we were evacuated from [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=386.1s)]
*  Brentwood, if that fire starts traveling west and gets into the Palisades, it's going to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=390.74s)]
*  roar down the mountain right into the Palisades and wipe out the town. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  And at the time, I called Garcetti and a whole bunch of city officials saying, we've got to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  clear this brush out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=403.94000000000005s)]
*  Garcetti being the mayor at the time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=405.22s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of excuses why that can't be done. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=406.5s)]
*  And a lot of people were, you know, raising hell about that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=412.34s)]
*  So you have the fuel. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=415.94s)]
*  That was the fuel. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=416.94s)]
*  You have the fire department that's been underfunded for at least 10 to 15 years. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=417.94s)]
*  We have equipment that is mothballed sitting in yards. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=423.86s)]
*  They can't be used because they don't have the mechanics to have them repaired so they [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=428.26s)]
*  can operate. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=432.1s)]
*  That's a sin. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=433.46s)]
*  And on top of it, Mayor Bass cut their funding even more this year. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=436.58s)]
*  So they were completely underfunded and the chief was very clear publicly, this is going [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  to impact our ability to keep people safe. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=445.58s)]
*  For some reason, the fire department did not deploy early. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=449.78s)]
*  They should have been stationed in these areas, knowing we had a fire about three weeks ago [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=452.46s)]
*  in almost the same exact spot where this fire started. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=457.9s)]
*  May have been the same exact spot. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=461.42s)]
*  You have the reservoir that's empty. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=463.66s)]
*  That reservoir supplies the fire hydrant. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=466.06s)]
*  So at 1030 at night on Tuesday, I get a call from one of my senior people that was in the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=468.06s)]
*  command center that said, your daughter's house just burned as they were trying to protect [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=473.78000000000003s)]

*  They ran out of water. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=481.62s)]
*  I just I couldn't imagine how you run out of water. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=483.06s)]
*  Well, they didn't manage the water supply properly. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  So all of these problems compounded. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=491.28s)]
*  And of course, you had the winds that were moving the embers along and it was very tough [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=494.0s)]
*  to control. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  But I really do believe if it couldn't have been completely prevented, it certainly could [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=500.17999999999995s)]
*  have been very, very mitigated and much less damage here. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=504.32s)]
*  It's it's the most frustrating, angering feeling as you go through that community to look at [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=508.96s)]
*  the impact on so many lives. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=515.56s)]
*  There's now an additional estimate of over 100,000 people that are homeless. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=518.28s)]
*  If Karen Bass were sitting here and we said to her, why did you allow the fire department [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=524.72s)]
*  to go underfunded? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=530.52s)]
*  What's like the steel man argument for why that was allowed to happen? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=532.48s)]
*  You really got to ask her that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=536.68s)]
*  I mean, I was so clear when I was running for mayor and one of the videos that I had [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=538.16s)]
*  made when I was running for mayor talked about fully funding the fire department and the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=542.76s)]
*  police department for that matter so that we have services like paramedics. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=547.68s)]
*  Let me tell you, you know what the busiest fire station is in the United States? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=552.96s)]
*  No fire station number 11. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=557.76s)]
*  This serves MacArthur Park. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=560.88s)]
*  You know why it's so busy? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=563.6s)]
*  It's not responding to fires. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=564.64s)]
*  It's responding to overdoses in the neighborhood because the amount of drugs on the streets. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=566.64s)]
*  I mean, MacArthur Park right now and like many other parts of the city are completely [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  overtaken by these poor souls, homeless, drug addicted. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=577.96s)]
*  The sale of drugs are open on the streets and that's why they're so busy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  Our priorities have just gotten so sideways in the city of L.A. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=590.36s)]
*  and we got to correct that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=595.48s)]
*  But you'd have to ask her that question. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  Rick, one of the things that's happened in the aftermath of these fires is that a lot of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=598.88s)]
*  people who are really annoyed at California and enraged about the incompetency in L.A. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  were saying that niche environmental concerns allowed this catastrophe to happen. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=608.88s)]
*  And I want you to bring some sense of proportion and help make sense of this for me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=614.48s)]
*  Tell me if it's been overblown or not. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=619.48s)]
*  Did concerns over, say, protecting the smelt fish or protecting this weed I had never [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=621.48s)]
*  heard of called a milk vetch? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=627.92s)]
*  If you go online right now or for the past few weeks, everyone has been talking about [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=629.76s)]
*  the milk vetch and the smelt fish. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=634.16s)]
*  And I can't really get a handle on whether or not these criticisms are overblown or not. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=637.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  I can't tell you precisely. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  But what I can tell you is, in my opinion, the priority always has to be the safety and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  the quality of life for the human beings and the residents. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=650.76s)]
*  And everything else should come second. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  The big question that I don't have an answer to, maybe you can look into it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  I think most of that mountain range behind the Palisades is controlled by the Santa [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=660.3599999999999s)]
*  Monica Conservancy and the Santa Monica Conservancy is a very strong political force. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=664.88s)]
*  And I would imagine I could be wrong, but I would imagine that they probably had a lot [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=671.4799999999999s)]
*  of resistance to brush management back there and elected officials or whatnot, you know, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  did not want to take them on. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  But I do think that many environmental concerns need to be measured against the safety of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=685.28s)]
*  people. I mean, that's just common sense. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=690.88s)]
*  And if people's safety is at risk, that's the priority. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=693.52s)]
*  Period. End of story. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=697.84s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the response to the fires. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=700.4s)]
*  About a thousand of the firefighters deployed to Los Angeles last month were incarcerated [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=704.56s)]
*  prisoners and they are paid a good deal less than the minimum wage. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=709.12s)]
*  They earn about six to ten dollars a day, although during the L.A. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=713.48s)]
*  fires, some made around thirty dollars a day. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=716.72s)]
*  And while the program is voluntary, it's been criticized because of the dangerous work [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=719.96s)]
*  and the lack of firefighting opportunities for prisoners once they're released. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=724.6400000000001s)]
*  What do you think about the ethics of that? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know all the ins and outs of that program, but I don't have a problem with that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  And from what I've read, Barry, they've actually did a very good job and work very hard [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=734.6s)]
*  out there. I mean, it's clear statewide we need more firefighters. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, what has come out is that there have been bills to hire more [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  statewide firefighters that were vetoed. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=748.32s)]
*  We need to turn that around. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  We need more firefighters in L.A. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  For sure, we do. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=755.1600000000001s)]
*  I'll just give you a perspective here again on this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=757.12s)]
*  If you take 1965 until today, the population of Los Angeles has more than doubled. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=761.5200000000001s)]
*  We have about the same amount of firefighters and we actually have less fire stations. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=768.6400000000001s)]
*  That's insane. It's insane. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=774.24s)]
*  And so where is that money gone? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  Rick, where did the money go? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  That's a really good listen. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=781.72s)]
*  We're spending billions of dollars on homeless with no results, by the way. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, the city of Los Angeles alone, we got over 40,000 homeless. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=787.48s)]
*  I think countywide is 70,000, 80,000 homeless. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=790.96s)]
*  So there's billions and billions going into it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=795.1600000000001s)]
*  We're not building anything. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=797.2s)]
*  We're not building new housing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=798.84s)]
*  The bond measure that was approved for housing Triple H, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=800.88s)]
*  we were supposed to build 10,000 homes over the last 10 years. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=804.84s)]
*  We barely built a thousand at an average of 800,000 a unit. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=808.24s)]
*  I mean, it's the mismanagement [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=813.44s)]
*  and the the the priorities are just upside down. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=817.96s)]
*  As simple as that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=821.24s)]
*  Hey, guys, Barry here. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxDPV0LD0s&t=822.6800000000001s)]
