What is the role of religion as a political force in this country?

Our guest today, Jonathan Rauch, says: “Christianity is a load-bearing wall of American civic life.” In other words, the success of liberal democracy depends on a healthy Christianity to support it—and if Christianity falters, our American project will falter too. We get into why that is in this conversation.

It’s a fascinating position for a person who happens to be a Jewish, atheist, gay man.

And Jonathan doesn’t just say we need to embrace Christianity; he goes a step further. He says that Christians need to look in the mirror and reconsider how Jesus would approach American politics today.

# Can America Survive Without Christianity?
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. In the past few weeks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=0.0s)]
*  we've done two episodes on religion. One, a debate asking if we need a religious revival, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=4.8s)]
*  and then a follow-up conversation with Ross Dalfit asking how people who grew up in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  secular West can actually find faith. Today, I have the last installment of this intellectual [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  and religious inquiry, at least for the time being. It's a subject I'm fascinated by. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=22.8s)]
*  Today, I'm asking a new question, which is, what is the role of religion as a political [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  force in this country? My guest today, Jonathan Rausch, argues that Christianity is a load-bearing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=32.64s)]
*  wall of American civic life. In other words, the success of our liberal democracy depends on a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=39.36s)]
*  healthy Christianity to support it. If that Christianity falters, the American project [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=45.84s)]
*  will falter too. We get into why that is in this fascinating conversation. It's also a very [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=51.76s)]
*  interesting subject for a person, and this is Jonathan, who happens to be an atheist gay Jew. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=58.4s)]
*  Jonathan doesn't just say we need to embrace Christianity. He goes a step further. He says [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=65.6s)]
*  that Christians need to look in the mirror and reconsider how Jesus would approach American [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=71.12s)]
*  politics today. Jonathan Rausch is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and he just [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=76.4s)]
*  wrote a book called Cross Purposes, Christianity's Broken Bargain with Democracy. I asked him about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  the breakdown of religion and Christianity specifically, and the impact it's had on our [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=88.64s)]
*  culture and on our politics and fundamentally on our democracy. We talk about the religious and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  political forces that shaped our founding and that also shaped our present moment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Things like MAGA, the evangelical movement, and their marriage to Trump specifically. I ask him [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=104.72s)]
*  about how Christianity, in his view, became a kind of consumer good and how this change threatens [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=110.48s)]
*  Christianity itself. We also talk about the rise of Christian nationalism, the threat it poses, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=117.44s)]
*  if that's been overstated, and most importantly, how we can restore health in American political [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=123.92s)]
*  life. Stay with us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=130.96s)]
*  Jonathan Rausch, welcome to Honestly. I'm so happy to be here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  All right, Jonathan, you are an atheist, you are a Jew, and you are a gay man. And yet right now, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  you have just published a book that makes an argument for the value of Christianity. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=148.88s)]
*  As my people would say, it's a pretty chutzpah-dick thing to do, kind of the epitome of chutzpah. So, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=154.56s)]
*  explain yourself. Why is this the book that you wrote? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=159.92s)]
*  Barry, if you had told me 20 years ago that this would be my project in life, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  I would have sent you for drug testing. 20 years ago, I was in the camp that said America is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  secularizing and isn't that great. Religion is divisive and dogmatic and we're going to have less [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  of it. And we'll be like, I don't know, Sweden or Denmark, we'll be Scandinavia, we'll be just [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=184.72s)]
*  happier. I was completely wrong about that. It's been the biggest mistake of my intellectual career. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=191.04s)]
*  The dumbest thing I ever wrote was a 2003 article in the Atlantic, in which I celebrated what I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=198.56s)]
*  called apotheism. So, what I was right about back then was that Christianity was caving in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=204.56s)]
*  A wave of the second of two big waves of secularization was loosed upon the land. What [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=212.72s)]
*  I was wrong about, all the indicators went south on things like loneliness, depression, anxiety, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=218.4s)]
*  social connectedness. You also saw the increase of polarization because people began infusing their [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=226.0s)]
*  political identities with a kind of almost religious zeal. In fact, not almost religious zeal, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=234.8s)]
*  out and out religious zeal. And then you started to see politics infecting the church. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=240.8s)]
*  So, people were coming to church and demanding that their pastors engage the culture war in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  partisan politics. And this produced a train wreck of a mashup in which it's harder for democracy [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=252.0s)]
*  to cope without the support that it used to get from Christianity and it's hard for Christianity [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=257.92s)]
*  to cope with all the pressure it's getting from politics. And here we are. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=262.56s)]
*  Okay, in this new book of yours called Cross Purposes, which is a wonderful title, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=266.96s)]
*  you ask a simple question, which is why has America become ungovernable? And you say it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=272.48s)]
*  not just the things that most people point to, the obvious things like Facebook or TikTok or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=280.0s)]
*  cable news. You say it is the caving in or the collapse of Christianity. And you talk [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=286.64s)]
*  about Christianity, and I love this metaphor, as a load-bearing wall. So, give us your thesis [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=292.4s)]
*  in a nutshell, please. Why is the decline of Christianity linked in short to our political [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=299.44s)]
*  decline? That's hard to nutshell, Barry. I'll do my best, but it's a multi-level answer. So, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  I'll try. And just cut me off or divert me if I start to filibuster. So, the first thing is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  what I just alluded to, which is that our society depends on organizations of faith. And in the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=322.32s)]
*  United States, that means overwhelmingly Christianity to perform a lot of basic social functions, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=329.36s)]
*  like socializing kids and giving people a sense of purpose and meaning in life, providing community, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=335.84s)]
*  group worship, providing outlets to places. A lot of people in the old days, when I grew up, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=342.56s)]
*  the first thing people asked each other wasn't often, where do you work or where are you from? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=349.28s)]
*  It was, what church do you go to? So, these were just pillars of our civic society, and they [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  crumbled. So, that's answer number one. Answer number two goes a little deeper, and that's that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  the founders warned us that they could give us a constitution, a structure for government, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=366.88s)]
*  but they warned us it could not last without what they called Republican virtue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  And they said to get that, you need to go to civil society. And by that, they meant, of course, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  family, community, schools, but they very significantly meant Christianity, meaning not [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=383.28s)]
*  that this is a Christian nation, but they assumed that Christianity would do this role of socializing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  people into the virtues. And that's what Sunday school and sermons were all about. And then, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=396.64s)]
*  there's a third level that's the deepest of all. And this one goes really deep. And for an atheist, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=402.64s)]
*  it's a little hard to admit, but I think it's true. There are two absolutely core questions [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=409.84s)]
*  in human existence that secularism cannot answer, but that religion can. And the first is, why am [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  I here? Is there a transcendent meaning in my life beyond just being a clump of protoplasm that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  appears one day and disappears the next? And the second is, what is good and evil? What is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=428.4s)]
*  morality rooted in that's more than just kind of a Nietzschean personal will to power? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=433.84s)]
*  We seculars can't answer that. We rely on religion, and that means Christianity to do that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  And we need that. We need that support. Okay. Before we get to the deepest level, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to stay on the second level for a minute, because the point you make on the founders, I think, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=452.4s)]
*  speaks to a kind of revisionist history that many of us who grew up in secularized America were [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=458.32s)]
*  taught. And that was basically, the pilgrims fled to America, they fled from England to escape [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=464.56s)]
*  religious persecution, and they founded the colonies, and they founded America on the idea [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=471.04s)]
*  of the separation between church and state. And you say that is far too simplified. Can you explain [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=476.0s)]
*  what that story that I think many of us were taught that essentially backfilled history in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  order to make an argument for the secular present, what that misses about the founders' worldview and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  their conception of the role of Christianity in America? Yeah, I should say in passing, I'm no [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  expert on the pre-revolutionary period, but the pilgrims and Puritans did not come seeking [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=502.96s)]
*  religious liberty for others. They came seeking it for themselves. They were quite intolerant. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=508.64s)]
*  But yes, the founders of our republic, especially Jefferson and Madison, who kind of invented the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=513.76s)]
*  concept of modern religious liberty, were very careful about distinguishing the church from the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=519.6s)]
*  state. They were called upon to Christianize America and to include the name of Jesus in [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=526.48s)]
*  the founding documents. There's a wonderful new book about this by Jerome Kapolsky called American [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=533.04s)]
*  Heretics about how the founders had to actually face down some attempts by Christians who were [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=538.08s)]
*  very unhappy that the country wasn't named as Christian. And yes, they believed, I think rightly, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=544.48s)]
*  that when the church and state intermingled, they both suffer. So all of that that we learned in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  civics is true. Yet it is also true at the same time that the founders had a pretty deep understanding [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=558.72s)]
*  of human psychology and that their legacy, the republic, if you can keep it, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  that Franklin spoke of, it's not self-sustaining. It needs outside support. It rests on a kind of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=574.48s)]
*  social substrate of what they called republican virtue, but that's things like in today's terms [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=582.16s)]
*  being well-informed, being tolerant, respecting other people's rights and freedom, respecting truth. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=588.0s)]
*  And these are things that the constitution itself doesn't teach. So what they were trying to do was [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=597.76s)]
*  draw on the resources of a Christian society, which in those days meant, let's face it, white Protestantism [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=603.36s)]
*  as the substrate for what they were doing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=611.6s)]
*  Why does that substrate level, you said before, it's Christianity, right? Why does it need to be [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  Christianity? Why can't Judaism be a bulwark for liberal democracy or maybe it can in other [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=620.4s)]
*  places? But what is it specifically about Christianity that you believe is essential [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  in America? Or is it just the fact that that's our history and so that's what we need to pull from? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  So once again, there's two true answers and they're both important, but one goes deeper than the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  other. And the first is what you just said. It is a Christian nation. It was founded by Christians [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  and the doctrines of the early liberal republic flow out of Christian doctrines at the time. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll come to that more, but yeah, to some extent it's an accident of history, but to some extent [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=659.2s)]
*  there was this deep interdependence between secular liberalism and Christianity. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=665.04s)]
*  So Christianity does play that special role in American society. It's apparently very challenging [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=671.92s)]
*  for an Islamic-based society to observe all the same rights and freedom. I think we've got a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=678.88s)]
*  Jewish society in Israel and it pulls it off. But in America, it turned out that the soil of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=685.6s)]
*  Christianity was good soil to grow a republic. Okay, so that's the more important but more [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=690.8s)]
*  superficial answer. So now let's go to the core argument of the book. This is not a book about [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=699.92s)]
*  religion is good, we need more of it. It's not a generic religion book. It's about Christianity, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=709.76s)]
*  it's addressed to Christians, and it says that the three core pillars that distinguish the Christian [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=715.52s)]
*  faith, and this is not coming from me, it's coming from theologians and pastors, those three pillars [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=722.24s)]
*  are also translated into three core pillars of liberal democracy. So they overlap and that's [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=730.4s)]
*  what Christianity brings. And in case you're wondering, those three pillars, number one, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=738.48s)]
*  don't be afraid. The most frequently repeated injunction in the Christian Bible, maybe the whole [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=744.88s)]
*  Bible. And that translates into sometimes you lose an election, it's not the end of the world. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=751.12s)]
*  Don't lie, cheat or panic. And resist demagogues who try to make you afraid, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=757.12s)]
*  something Hamilton and Lincoln warned us about. The second pillar of Christianity, be like Jesus, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=762.88s)]
*  imitate him. Jesus grounds his ministry in the care of the poorest, the weakest, the sickest, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=769.52s)]
*  the most marginal. That's a radical new view in human history. And that translates directly [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=776.8s)]
*  into modern secular liberalism of minority rights, which are enshrined in the Bill of Rights, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  and then the idea which comes from Kant and the other great liberal philosophers, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=789.04s)]
*  always treat people as ends in themselves, never as means to an end, respect the equal dignity [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=794.16s)]
*  of all human beings. That's Jesus's radical egalitarianism. The third pillar of Christianity [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=800.0s)]
*  is forgive each other, which is super, super hard to do and a very radical doctrine. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  And that translates into Madisonian liberalism, as sometimes you win an election, but the goal [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=815.2s)]
*  of politics is not to crush the other side and salt the soil with the tears of their women and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=822.48s)]
*  children. The goal is always to share the country and treat the other side as you will want them [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=828.24s)]
*  to treat you when they're victorious. And that's core to Republican virtue. You can't run a liberal [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=835.28s)]
*  democracy without those three Christian pillars. So that puts me in this weird position, Barry, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=840.4s)]
*  of reading the gospels and thinking about Christianity and saying, you know, by God, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  right here in Christian doctrine are the three elements that America needs more of right now, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  whether you're secular or Christian. Some people I think, let's, this might be impossible, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=858.48s)]
*  but let's put Jesus to the side for a second. I think many people who identify themselves as [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=865.36s)]
*  secular or maybe they call themselves secular humanists will hear the description of morality [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=872.24s)]
*  that you've just laid out with these pillars, forgiveness, not demonizing your opponents. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=879.04s)]
*  You didn't say the word compromise, but I think that was implicit in there. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yes. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=888.64s)]
*  Looking out for minority rights and say, I believe in all of those things and I don't need [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  Christianity to believe in all of those things. How do you respond to that argument? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  Barry Well, first of all, I don't believe in Christianity either and I do believe in all of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=899.44s)]
*  those things. And that's fine. But I mentioned earlier that my book is addressed to Christians [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=904.0s)]
*  and I mentioned earlier that Christianity is in crisis right now. I can read you the numbers, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=911.2s)]
*  but they're astonishing, the collapse that we've seen in Christianity in just the past 20 years. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=915.76s)]
*  Seems to have leveled off, thank goodness, the past two or three years. But this book is addressed [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=922.56s)]
*  to Christians because it says the people who most need those doctrines of Jesus right now [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=928.0s)]
*  are not secular Americans, but Christians. The church has drifted away from those three doctrines, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=934.88s)]
*  specifically the white evangelical church. And what I'm asking for is for Christians to become [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=941.36s)]
*  more Christ-like and bring that to politics. And as you say, it's pretty chutzpah-dick, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=950.16s)]
*  if that's a word. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=955.84s)]
*  Lauren Luzarovitz Chutzpah-dick. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  Barry Chutzpah-dick. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=957.52s)]
*  Lauren Luzarovitz It's creating the adjective version of chutzpah. People can look up the way [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  that Yiddish functions. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=963.84s)]
*  Barry If you have to look it up, you'll never understand it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=964.72s)]
*  You can chat GBT yet. Okay. Let's dive into why religion has declined in America, although later [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=968.48s)]
*  in the conversation, I think that there are some very, very interesting, you could call them [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=977.12s)]
*  green shoots, you could call them developments about the sort of revival of Christianity in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  America and beyond. But let's stay for a minute on the premise of your book, which is the decline [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=986.0s)]
*  of religion and how Christianity in America has drifted away from the three pillars that you [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  just laid out. You argue that white Protestantism was sort of the bedrock, the substrate of American [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=997.36s)]
*  life, but that it got, and this is your adjective, thin. So I want you to explain what thin Christianity [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  is and how thin Christianity came to conquer most of American Christianity and notably Protestantism. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1013.76s)]
*  Barry I distinguish here between two stories that are really one story, which is secularization. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1024.16s)]
*  And secularization is what happens when the church basically becomes like the surrounding society. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1030.16s)]
*  Christianity is a countercultural religion. Jesus was very much at odds with his own culture, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1039.52s)]
*  and Christianity is at its best and most attractive when it's countercultural and asking [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1046.08s)]
*  people to lead their lives in a way that's like Jesus and focuses on the next world, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1051.04s)]
*  and not the guy next door and focused on the here and now. When Christianity loses that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1056.0s)]
*  cultural distinctiveness and looks like everything else, it loses its appeal. So thin Christianity, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1063.6s)]
*  that's the wave of secularization that took place in the mainline Protestant churches, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1070.0s)]
*  the ecumenical churches in the last century, the second half of the century. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the United Methodists and the Episcopal Church and the Lutherans and all of those that [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1079.84s)]
*  we took for granted when we were kids. And they got, there's a lot of scholarship about this. I [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1086.56s)]
*  don't dive into it in any great detail, but they got unmoored from the teachings of the Bible. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  They kind of started pursuing a road of kind of social theology of doing good in society. Their [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1099.6s)]
*  pastorate became very left wing, more so than the people in the ranks. And it reached the point where [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1105.52s)]
*  a retired Presbyterian minister who I interviewed just three weeks ago told me, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  in the church groups, it was very common to never even hear the word God. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1118.08s)]
*  And when the church lost that distinctiveness and lost that grounding and cultural in the Bible and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1123.92s)]
*  that countercultural quality, people just kind of wandered off. If you want to just [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1129.36s)]
*  do volunteer work and be a good general person and have left leaning politics, you don't have [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1136.24s)]
*  to give up a Sunday. And that's the thin church when it becomes too thin to support the cultural [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1140.56s)]
*  teaching. Well, it's sort of like if I think this happened, frankly, in liberal Judaism over the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1146.4799999999998s)]
*  past decades as well, where it's almost the cyclical phenomenon where people are becoming [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1152.4799999999998s)]
*  less religious. And so the knee-jerk reaction is to make the church or the synagogue more relevant [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1157.92s)]
*  to people's contemporary problems by making it explicitly about social or political or culture [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1163.92s)]
*  war issues. But then I think the issue, and tell me if you disagree with this, is if you're going [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  to go to a march for against climate change, or if you're going to go to a pro-choice march, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1176.8000000000002s)]
*  that is going to be the stronger version of the heroin that whatever your pastor or your rabbi is [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1181.68s)]
*  ever going to be able to provide. And so in trying to imitate the thing that they feel perhaps they're [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1186.72s)]
*  competing with, although maybe they're not even thinking of it this way, they end up watering [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1194.32s)]
*  themselves down and just being the weaker version of the strong argument that people can get outside [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1198.8s)]
*  of the walls of church or synagogue. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And it's what [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1204.16s)]
*  sociologists say happened. It was not ill intention. I don't come at this as someone who [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1208.88s)]
*  believes there are a bunch of left-wing activists and wokesters who took things over. It came out [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1214.48s)]
*  of a genuine desire to be relevant to today's Americans. But I think it misjudged what Christianity, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1218.48s)]
*  again, I'm being pretty chutzpah-dick here, but I think we've coined a permanent new phrase. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1227.84s)]
*  But I think it ran counter to the appeal specifically of Christianity, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1234.16s)]
*  which is counter-cultural. I mean, think about it. This is a God who dies in the most painful way, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1238.88s)]
*  in the way slaves are punished. This is not something that's like the rest of society or [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1246.0s)]
*  our everyday assumptions at all. So correct me if I'm wrong, but thin Christianity is Christianity [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1253.1200000000001s)]
*  that has essentially been watered down. And this can happen on the right or the left, but has been [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1260.64s)]
*  watered down and sort of refashioned in order to, and from a well-intentioned perspective, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1268.16s)]
*  to speak to the political and cultural zeitgeist, but in effect, leaves the true message and the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  true pillars of Christianity behind. That's the thin version of Christianity. You also write in [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1280.3200000000002s)]
*  the book about what you call sharp Christianity. And sharp Christianity, I think you would argue, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1285.2s)]
*  typifies what has happened in the evangelical world. Talk to us about sharp Christianity and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1293.68s)]
*  what makes that different from thin Christianity that has perhaps typified the Protestant world. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1299.52s)]
*  Matthew 14 I mentioned two [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1304.5600000000002s)]
*  waves of secularization. They're both secularization, but they're very different in the way they [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  instantiate. The story in the late 20th century, the world that I and you grew up in, is the mainline [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1313.2s)]
*  churches are dying because they're not culturally relevant. But the evangelical church is growing [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1322.16s)]
*  and thriving because it is still countercultural on things like sexual mores, homosexuality, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  abortion, things that I disagree on, but they do distinguish it from the culture. And it is biblically [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  rooted. You cannot go to an evangelical service and not hear many quotations from Jesus and a lot of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1338.5600000000002s)]
*  talk about God. What we didn't realize would happen was the second great wave of secularization, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1344.4s)]
*  which comes in this century just over really between the period of 2000 and 2020. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1351.36s)]
*  And that's the rapid decline in the evangelical church. The percentage of people who define [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1357.76s)]
*  themselves as Christian between 2007 and 2021, that's only 14 years, it drops by 15 percentage [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1367.12s)]
*  points from 78% to 63%. And where did they all go? They go to no religion. And where are they [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1375.68s)]
*  coming from? White Protestantism almost entirely. Catholicism has been pretty stable. And so what [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1382.8s)]
*  happened there? The sharp church, starting in the 80s and then on into the 90s, you begin to get [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1388.88s)]
*  a large migration, a large movement of white evangelicals into partisan politics. And they [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1397.12s)]
*  kind of approach it with a gamble that if the church gets into politics, partisan politics, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1406.08s)]
*  that politics will be affected more than the church. And then they lose that gamble. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1413.6799999999998s)]
*  In this century, the white evangelical church becomes almost indistinguishable from the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1418.4799999999998s)]
*  Republican Party in terms of its views on things, in terms of its voting behavior. By the time of [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1425.44s)]
*  John McCain, it's voting 80 plus percent for every Republican presidential candidate. And then that [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1430.72s)]
*  turbo charges under Trump. And so as that church gets more and more politicized, people who are [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  not there for politics, again, you can do politics without giving up a Sunday morning, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1445.3600000000001s)]
*  they begin to drift away. And as Russell Moore, the editor of Christianity Today says, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1449.6s)]
*  a lot of the public begins to perceive hypocrisy in the church. They say, wait a minute, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  where are these values of Jesus? In the way you're approaching politics, we're seeing the same kind [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1462.32s)]
*  of partisan meanness and divisiveness and social media and in politics. Who needs the church for [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1468.08s)]
*  that? So as Russell says, when he asks, he's asked why young people are fleeing the church, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1474.16s)]
*  he says, look, if the only choice you're giving Christians, young Christians is between paganization [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  and secularization, they're going to choose one or the other. So that's the second big wave. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  And that leads us to where we are, where you've got a church that's too sharp, meaning it's very [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  polarized, very political and also diminished in size and you've got a church that's too thin. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1496.0s)]
*  And you've got a problem if you're depending on Christianity to do this social work that we rely [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1501.04s)]
*  on it for. We've talked about Protestants and evangelicals, where do Catholics fit into this? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1505.9199999999998s)]
*  Because bluntly, some of the most intellectual conservatives, many of the most intellectual [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1512.96s)]
*  conservatives I know, are either drawn to Catholicism or become Catholic. Where does the [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1521.36s)]
*  Catholic church fit into this landscape that you've laid out? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1526.64s)]
*  So the Catholic church is kind of off to one side in my narrative because it's an international [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1530.88s)]
*  church. It's a hierarchical church and it has been able to resist more of the secularization [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1538.0s)]
*  that we've seen in white Protestantism. Protestantism, after all, you know, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1547.2800000000002s)]
*  every congregation hires and fires its own pastors. So if the pastor's not political enough, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1551.0400000000002s)]
*  out he goes. Not true in Catholicism. Catholicism has also held more of its numbers. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1556.48s)]
*  Why? Why do you think it hasn't been susceptible to the thinning or the sharpening? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1564.48s)]
*  I think it's because, well, I'm no expert on this, but the main reason that I would cite [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1569.76s)]
*  is that it has a hierarchical order that keeps it grounded. It makes it harder to be sort of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1578.0800000000002s)]
*  permeated by local politics. You know, there's only, you can be a Catholic priest or a Catholic [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1584.08s)]
*  congregation in, you know, Shemokin, but there's only so much you can do to affect the doctrine of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1590.24s)]
*  the church and the way the service is going to go. So there's that kind of stability with [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1596.24s)]
*  Catholicism. And also we should add it's not America's founding religion. And so it's not [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  where the core of our crisis is right now. Let's talk about the story of [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1608.48s)]
*  evangelicals and how they came to be married, not just to the Republican party, but to Trump. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1614.08s)]
*  And of course, we're talking in like real generalities here. So I just want to caveat that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1621.76s)]
*  when I was coming of age, now I'm old, you know, that marriage broadly made sense. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1627.04s)]
*  In other words, a Republican party that is pro-life, that is anti-gay marriage, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1636.0800000000002s)]
*  that wants to put conservatives on the court, it's like, yeah, if you are a conservative, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1643.68s)]
*  evangelical, where else would you go other than the Republican party? To me, that marriage [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1649.44s)]
*  never seemed that uncomfortable or awkward or uneasy. That changed, of course, with the rise [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1655.28s)]
*  of Donald Trump, who was none of those things. And yet the church, again, I'm speaking very [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1662.8s)]
*  broadly, accommodated itself to Trump. How did he do it? You know, how did the least religious [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1668.48s)]
*  president, maybe in modern American history, come to capture the most fervent Christians in America? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1677.6s)]
*  Because I think the cynical view is, you know, you have one of two choices, and this was the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1684.96s)]
*  choice that was going to secure Christians the court. And if you ask many of them, they'll say, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1689.76s)]
*  yeah, like held our nose, voted for him, that choice paid off. Tell us that story of [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1696.0s)]
*  accommodation to Trump and where a lot of those people who you spoke to in the process of writing [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1703.6s)]
*  this book, whether or not they have regrets about it, just tell us this story. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1710.08s)]
*  Well, I should say that the initial attitude was accommodation with a certain amount of reluctance [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1715.12s)]
*  right at the beginning in 2016. But white evangelicals went on to embrace and in fact, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1720.8s)]
*  almost idolize Trump. They are now far more than any other group his base. Okay, so what happened [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  there? If you will indulge me, I'm going to go back to the Bible for that. Let's go to the source. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1734.24s)]
*  In Matthew four, Jesus having newly been baptized, begins his ministry, prepares for his ministry [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1743.76s)]
*  by spending 40 days and nights in the wilderness. And there he encounters Satan, who takes him to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  the top of the highest mountain and shows him all of human dominion and says, all of this will be [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1759.68s)]
*  yours if you will just bow down and worship me. And we know how that story ends. Jesus says, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1766.96s)]
*  go away, Satan, get thee behind me. He turns down that offer of power in this world [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1773.68s)]
*  at the expense of salvation in the next world. Fast forward to January of 2016. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1781.3600000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump is giving a speech at Dort College, which is an evangelical school in Iowa. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  And in that speech, he says two things. And I'll bet you did not know because I did not know until [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1797.92s)]
*  recently that he says both of these historic things in that speech. The first thing he says is, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1802.72s)]
*  if you vote for me, you will have power like you've never had before. Remember that. The second thing [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1810.56s)]
*  he says in that speech, you know, like half an hour later, is my supporters are the most loyal [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1818.0s)]
*  in the world. They're so loyal, I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and they wouldn't care. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1827.28s)]
*  And notice what he's doing here. The deal he's offering is I will give you power like you've [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1833.36s)]
*  never had before and you will give me unconditional loyalty. And that's the deal that they took. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1838.48s)]
*  It's the same deal Jesus rejected because he knew it could be corrupting. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1844.8s)]
*  Why did they take the deal? Actually, there's some good reasons to take it, right? Why do evangelicals, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  cultural conservatives feel embattled? And they have reason to feel embattled. You know, it's [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1855.6s)]
*  everything from there is no war on Christmas, but they fear for Christianity in the public square. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, if you're on social media all the time, you think maybe your kid's going to come home [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1866.48s)]
*  with a sex change there. It's a scary world if you're a cultural conservative. But so they decide [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1870.64s)]
*  the way to deal with that is power and Trump offers them power. And that's the deal they made. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1876.64s)]
*  What Russell Moore and many other Christians, you asked what do Christians think of this? A lot of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1882.0800000000002s)]
*  people in the pastorate are very unhappy about it because they do see it as rubbing against the grain [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1888.64s)]
*  of Jesus's teaching. And there is a price you pay for hypocrisy if you're a Christian or anyone else. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1897.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, you get some, you get political victories. But after a while, something else Russell Moore [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1904.0s)]
*  says, younger people who had been coming to him in the past saying they had left Christianity or [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1909.76s)]
*  become doubters because they no longer believed in what the church preached, started coming to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1915.8400000000001s)]
*  him saying that they were leaving the church because they no longer believed the church [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1921.52s)]
*  believed what the church preached. And when the church begins to follow someone who instead of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1925.84s)]
*  saying be not afraid, says be very afraid your country's being invaded only I can protect you. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1930.96s)]
*  When it follows someone who instead of saying be like Jesus and never use people as means to an end, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1937.2s)]
*  says things like categorizing a whole class of people as vermin. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1946.48s)]
*  And when instead of forgive each other, it follows someone who says I am your retribution. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1951.92s)]
*  That's very hard to square with the teachings of Jesus. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1958.0s)]
*  Nicole Soule One of the big stories for those who have [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1960.72s)]
*  been paying attention since Trump came to power are the sort of like internal battles in evangelical [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1964.0s)]
*  world about this. And there were people that did not go along broadly with the story that you're [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1970.32s)]
*  describing. Maybe tell us a story about one or two of them. Like, what happened to the people that [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1977.12s)]
*  didn't go along with Trump? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1982.3999999999999s)]
*  Russell Moore So I interviewed and have his personal friends, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1983.6799999999998s)]
*  a number of Christians who got crosswise with the political leanings of the large majority of their [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1987.6s)]
*  church. One of them is Russell Moore, who I spoke of earlier, someone I deeply respect and have [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=1994.16s)]
*  become friends with despite being very much on opposite sides of, for instance, the gay marriage [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2001.92s)]
*  debate back 15 years ago. And Russell is someone who both as a man of faith and also as a senior [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  leader of the Southern Baptist Convention became a kind of conscientious objector. First, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2018.32s)]
*  he never silenced himself about his reservations about Trump. And then a separate issue, he became [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2024.72s)]
*  outspoken on the need for the church to do more about problems with sexual abuse in the rank. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2031.52s)]
*  And the environment became so hostile to him. I don't remember the details, but essentially, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2037.84s)]
*  essentially he was driven out. Southern Baptist Convention essentially put him up to a trial. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2042.96s)]
*  He tells a very moving story about what his kids said and what his wife said, which is basically, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2051.92s)]
*  we don't see how you can keep doing this. So he left the Southern Baptist. He's still very [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2062.64s)]
*  much a Christian, but he's unaffiliated. We could talk about other people, many of whom are known [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2067.92s)]
*  to your readers, people like David French. But I think more common among the pastors I talk to [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2073.52s)]
*  are the very large number that kind of suffer in silence. So the very first way of politicization [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2084.08s)]
*  of white evangelical church comes from the top down. It's figures like Reverend Lou Sheldon, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2090.64s)]
*  Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson. But this wave, the big wave, the real embrace of [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2096.88s)]
*  Republican partisan politics in the age of Magnus coming from the bottom up. And these are people [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2104.2400000000002s)]
*  who are bringing politics to church and saying, we don't want to hear about turn the other cheek. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2110.8s)]
*  What's that? We want to hear about what we can do in this church to take our country back. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2115.28s)]
*  That's not why pastors are there. A couple years ago, a research group called BARNA [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2121.6800000000003s)]
*  asked pastors if they had seriously thought about quitting in the past [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2127.6s)]
*  one year. And 42% said yes. And the number three reason they gave, the first two I don't remember, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2131.92s)]
*  but there was something like long hours and low pay, stressful job, whatever. The number three [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2137.04s)]
*  reason was politics in church. They want to preach the gospel, but they find more and more [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2142.4s)]
*  resistance among church members. And that's demoralizing to them. And a lot of them just [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2148.8s)]
*  kind of retreat and pull back. I have to tell you the thing that I don't understand. Why wouldn't we [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2153.1200000000003s)]
*  expect Christians to fight for a culture that reflects and defends Christianity? Why wouldn't [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2160.96s)]
*  we expect Christians, let's just take COVID, you know, this is a country that broadly speaking, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2168.32s)]
*  shut down churches and synagogues and arrested people even that prayed in open parking lots [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2174.24s)]
*  and allowed bars to be open. And so to me, the argument that, you know, this is a country, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2180.72s)]
*  especially in those years, that betrayed its core principles of religious liberty, that, you know, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2187.6s)]
*  maybe put it in a more sharp way, turned its back against Christians or maybe to put it even [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2196.88s)]
*  more sharply, actively suppressed Christianity in favor of secular culture. Like, I see why that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2203.6800000000003s)]
*  argument has resonance. So it's one thing to say, you know, it's a little weird for people in a [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2213.04s)]
*  church to be looking to their pastor to get Donald Trump elected. But I think it's perfectly reasonable [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2218.7200000000003s)]
*  and sensible to say, hey, in a culture in which many of our core beliefs and even our ability to [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2225.2s)]
*  practice our faith is not being protected by the state and we need to fight for that. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2231.68s)]
*  Pete So, I am not and never have been the kind of secular hardliner who says no one should bring [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2236.64s)]
*  their religion to politics. I've always thought just the opposite. Of course, your religion, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2248.72s)]
*  your faith is a key part of your life. It informs your values and of course, it should [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2253.44s)]
*  inform your politics. And I'm also someone who says, I say in this book, I say every chance I get, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2257.68s)]
*  as hard as I am on Christians for some tragic choices that they made, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2264.96s)]
*  we secular liberals bear significant blame. For too long, we neglected Christianity, we took it [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2270.48s)]
*  for granted at best, or we were at worst overtly hostile to it. And we need to do better. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2277.84s)]
*  And we can talk about how to do better and that's an important thread. But okay. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2284.32s)]
*  So, to answer your question, let me avert to a pastor no longer on the pulpit but now leads a [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2289.92s)]
*  group called Redeeming Babel. His name is Curtis Chang. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2295.76s)]
*  Kirsten Khire Redeeming Babel? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  Pete Yep, Redeeming Babel. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2301.28s)]
*  Kirsten Khire That's a cool name. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2302.6400000000003s)]
*  Pete B-A-B-E-L. Yeah, they do some wonderful work. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2303.36s)]
*  So, as Curtis says, he's not alone, there's a lot of other people saying this, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2306.8s)]
*  but as he puts it, what we're talking about now is not the what of politics. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2314.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not whether you go in trying to get stuff done. It's the how of politics. It's how do you [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2320.1600000000003s)]
*  approach that mission? The big gap, the single biggest gap from, you know, now putting on my [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2326.6400000000003s)]
*  secular hat is someone who cares about governability. The core of the crisis has been that the church [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2333.28s)]
*  has been pretty good about what they call discipling people, spiritual formation. That's [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2339.92s)]
*  making people in the image of Jesus. They're pretty good at that in church life, family life, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2344.96s)]
*  community life, you know, when Hurricane Helene comes in Asheville, the churches are there. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2350.7200000000003s)]
*  What they have not done is just a huge gap is discipling people in how to be like Jesus [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2355.52s)]
*  in civic life, public life, and that's social media and politics. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2363.12s)]
*  And that's a question of how do you approach politics? Do you do it in a spirit of generosity [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2367.28s)]
*  or a spirit of fear? Do you do it in a spirit where you respect other people's fundamental [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2372.32s)]
*  rights and dignity? Or do you do it in a way that's name calling and vicious? Do you do it in a way [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2378.96s)]
*  that's forgiving, that maybe doesn't attribute the worst motives to people who take a different [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2386.96s)]
*  view? Or do you demand retribution? And that's where the church has really fallen down. And [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2392.32s)]
*  that's where I think it has the most to contribute, a more Christ-like tone of Christians in politics. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2399.04s)]
*  If Christians, especially if white evangelicals could move from modeling the behaviors of often [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2405.44s)]
*  the worst of social media to modeling in politics, the tone and behaviors of Jesus Christ, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2412.32s)]
*  I think that would do a lot to heal our country and maybe also even the church. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2418.4s)]
*  Lyle Lierman Just to try and articulate the steel man position for the other side, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2423.04s)]
*  those that perhaps you would say have given into a sharp Christianity, they would say, well, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2429.6000000000004s)]
*  civility is all well and good, Jonathan Rausch, but look where it's gotten us. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2435.92s)]
*  It hasn't worked. What do you say to that argument that they make often every day on social media? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2440.48s)]
*  Jonathan Rausch Well, the first response is David French's response as a Christian. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's it's not supposed to quote unquote work. That's not why you're here. This is about [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2451.04s)]
*  the next life, not the next election. And if you're a Christian, that means there's certain things [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2457.12s)]
*  you do because God wants you to do them, not because they work. And the whole way of talking [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  about does it work is offensive to people like Russell Moore and David French, because that's [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2466.72s)]
*  not what Christianity is about. But okay, set that to one side. I gave you some numbers earlier, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2472.9599999999996s)]
*  and I could give you many more on the collapse of the church, especially Protestantism in America. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2478.8799999999997s)]
*  So I would argue that when your church in terms of the population is falling by a percentage point [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2485.7599999999998s)]
*  a year, which is, as you know, in the world of social change, that is seismic. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2491.44s)]
*  When you're collapsing at that rate, guys, what you're doing is not working. This is not successful [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2498.1600000000003s)]
*  witness for Jesus Christ, even on its own terms, and becoming very small, while also being very [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2506.56s)]
*  partisan and divisive and controversial is not a recipe for even political success. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2513.76s)]
*  Let me just push back a tiny bit. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2520.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2521.8399999999997s)]
*  On the question of working, right, and how that's offensive. How can it, if you're a believing [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2522.3999999999996s)]
*  Christian, this is not my view, but if you're a believing Christian who thinks that abortion is a [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2527.52s)]
*  kind of genocide, and making sure that Roe gets overturned as the law of the land would prevent [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2533.68s)]
*  that, and you've done that by aligning yourself with Donald Trump, who appoints Kavanaugh and [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2541.2s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett, etc., etc., etc., how is that not an expression of your Christianity in the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2547.04s)]
*  world? Why is it offensive to think about it in that kind of, I don't know, pragmatic way? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2554.16s)]
*  Well, where am I wrong there? Like, what am I missing? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2563.2s)]
*  I guess it's a question of up to what point, and how much do you have to give up to get that win, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2566.72s)]
*  and why do you continue to support that kind of public leader in exactly the same way when [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2572.24s)]
*  you're given alternatives who are just as staunch on the issue? I noticed, I think a lot of people [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2580.8799999999997s)]
*  noticed, that Mike Pence ran for president in 2024. He's the real thing. He's a believing Christian. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2586.24s)]
*  He's firmer, I would argue, on those issues, and especially abortion than Donald Trump, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2593.4399999999996s)]
*  whose position now is basically pro-choice, you know, let the states handle it. We're not [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2600.24s)]
*  going to interfere if they want to kill children. That is not a position that's very consistent [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2604.16s)]
*  with a real opposition to abortion. So, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2609.9199999999996s)]
*  Pence gets how much traction? Does he even get 10 minutes? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2616.0s)]
*  No. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  So, what seems to have happened is that the church, members of the church, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2620.0s)]
*  are now seemingly identifying more with the MAGA movement and the Republican Party and a thing [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2625.44s)]
*  called Christian nationalism than they are with the teachings of Jesus. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2633.36s)]
*  All right. Well, that's a perfect transition because Christian nationalism is a rising phenomenon [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2637.84s)]
*  that, depending on who you ask, is one of the gravest threats to democracy or overblown, and [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2644.4s)]
*  I feel confused, frankly, about which it is right now, but it's something that I'm paying [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2651.52s)]
*  tremendous attention to, not least because many people that identify that way are pretty [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2656.7200000000003s)]
*  blatant anti-Semites of one kind or another. Talk to me about what you mean, Jonathan, when you [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2664.5600000000004s)]
*  say Christian nationalism. What does it mean to be a Christian nationalist? Who are people that [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2671.36s)]
*  listeners should know about that are the leaders of this movement? How big is it? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2677.2799999999997s)]
*  And how worried should we be about it? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2682.64s)]
*  Well, I also don't know what I mean by Christian nationalism. The problem with that term, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  a lot of scholars have looked at it, and it's just such a grab bag of different ideas that it's very [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  hard to pin down what it means, but two things seem to be generally true of it. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2700.88s)]
*  The first is that it's a doctrine that Christians need to win in politics and political life. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2709.84s)]
*  We're the winners, and God wants us to win. And the second thing that scholars say is true of it [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2716.64s)]
*  is it's not a religious movement. It's a secular movement. It's about political power. It appropriates [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2724.4s)]
*  Christian symbolism, but it rarely mentions Jesus. It rarely quotes the Bible, and in fact, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2731.36s)]
*  it's at odds with the teachings of Jesus who separated power in this world from power in the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2737.7599999999998s)]
*  next. So, it's very different from Christianity as the mainline church has traditionally understood [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2744.24s)]
*  it. So, okay, how important is it? Who are the people? The best person to talk to about that or [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2754.9599999999996s)]
*  read his book is a guy named Matthew Taylor who's got chapter and verse on the specific evolution [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2761.4399999999996s)]
*  of Christian nationalism. It is not new. It is very old. You can trace it back to the days of the [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2766.3999999999996s)]
*  founding, and I'm afraid I don't remember all the names offhand, but there are people most of your [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2771.6s)]
*  audience would not have heard of, names like, I think, Lance Wallnau, for example. How big and [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2777.92s)]
*  how important are they? They're pretty big. They are very influential in Trump world. Again, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2784.56s)]
*  Matthew Taylor has the chapter and verse on all of that. They're especially active in the [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2793.2s)]
*  Pentecostal church. They're especially active in non-denominational churches as opposed to [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2799.2s)]
*  the more traditional institutionalized churches. They're very tech savvy and plugged in. They're [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2805.9199999999996s)]
*  very globalized, and they are very determined to win, and for the most part, they have not [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2812.7999999999997s)]
*  bought into liberal democracy, per se. They have some vision or other of a Christian nation. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2818.72s)]
*  They seem to be quite influential in MAGA world. Taylor argues that they're very influential. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2825.36s)]
*  The reason I'm sounding a little bit hesitant is because I went in a different direction with this [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2831.04s)]
*  book. I figured there's so much about Christian nationalism, per se. I wanted to look at what's [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2838.88s)]
*  going on in your ordinary church in the ordinary ranks and how politics begins to see in among [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2845.28s)]
*  people who would not necessarily define themselves as Christian nationalists, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2851.2s)]
*  but who nonetheless have come to see their version of Christianity as coincident with [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2857.4399999999996s)]
*  a political movement for power de facto. That's a lot of very ordinary Christians. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2862.96s)]
*  That's a large number of people. Again, these are not the people who are out there on January 6th [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2870.56s)]
*  with the crosses and the Christian symbolism, but these are people who are driving a political [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2876.48s)]
*  agenda in the churches. Those are also the people who I think maybe could be reached by more Christian [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2883.92s)]
*  messages saying, hey, maybe there's a different way to do this, a way that's both more Christ-like and [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2891.84s)]
*  more successful. Okay. If you could, we've talked about [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2897.84s)]
*  thin Christianity and the threats of it. We've talked about sharp Christianity. I think anyone [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2905.12s)]
*  who has not been living under a rock will know exactly what you mean when you talk about the [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2910.0s)]
*  marriage between sharp Christianity and Mangaism or Trump. We've talked a little bit about Christian [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2913.52s)]
*  nationalism, although that clearly deserves its own episode and conversation. These transformations, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2921.04s)]
*  how have they directly impacted our democracy and our civic life? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2928.0s)]
*  Going back to the assumptions that you had when you were growing up in this country versus where [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2934.8s)]
*  we are now, draw a line because there's a lot of people that listen to the show be like, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2942.32s)]
*  interesting, curiosity, I'm learning a lot of new things. Never really thought that much about [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2946.6400000000003s)]
*  these developments inside American Christianity, but you're saying it's relevant to everybody, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2951.6s)]
*  regardless if you've ever set foot in a church. I want you to just really underline how that is. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2957.68s)]
*  This brings us back to our starting point, but hopefully with a little bit more depth [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2965.12s)]
*  of understanding. I think there's a crisis in America, and not just in America, by the way, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2971.8399999999997s)]
*  it's in pretty much to most of the liberal democracies, a crisis of governability. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2979.12s)]
*  In America, we see this in the form of extreme polarization, which is not about policy [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2985.6s)]
*  disagreement as it used to be. It's what's called affective polarization. It's literal fear and [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2991.6s)]
*  hatred of the other party. We're seeing politics being invested with the sanctimony of faith and [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=2996.88s)]
*  religion. We're seeing people pour their identities into partisan politics in the way that they once [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3005.28s)]
*  would have identified as a Lutheran, a Methodist, a Southern Baptist. We're seeing even worse than [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3012.32s)]
*  that, politics itself become a religion. Politics has to be about give and take. It's got to be [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3020.32s)]
*  about living together, about compromising, and making room for each other. When politics itself [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3026.2400000000002s)]
*  becomes a religion with apocalyptic stakes, so that if we on the left or we on the right lose [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3034.32s)]
*  the next election, we lose our country, we lose Christianity, we lose everything. Politics can't [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3040.56s)]
*  sustain that, and every election becomes apocalyptic. That's the world we live in. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3047.6000000000004s)]
*  That's why I wrote this book, Here I Am, the Atheistic Gay Jew, saying, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3055.28s)]
*  if there were two things I could fix right now to solve our politics and get ourselves back together, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3062.16s)]
*  the first would be Congress, which is broken at different conversations, and the second would be [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3067.68s)]
*  Christianity, because the teachings of Jesus Christ have so much that we secular Americans need [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3071.92s)]
*  right now, and the Christians especially need right now. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3078.16s)]
*  How do we fix it? How do we fix it? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3083.04s)]
*  I don't fix it, and you don't fix it because we're Jews. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3085.68s)]
*  How can the church reorient itself toward the pillars that you spoke about before, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3088.4s)]
*  the three pillars, or broadly the teachings of Jesus, rather than the road it's going down, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3095.36s)]
*  which is a kind of battlefield, zero-sum mindset? Is it possible? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3101.28s)]
*  I have to hope it's possible, but I don't honestly know the answer to that question. I know that [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3107.44s)]
*  secular person, as a Jew, as an outsider, the best I can do is try to explain, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  try to convince secular liberals, small illiberal, your audience knows what I mean, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3123.1200000000003s)]
*  people who believe in the Declaration and the Constitution and all that, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3129.5200000000004s)]
*  is try to convince secular liberals that we have a stake in the vitality of Christianity, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  and by that I mean Jesus-centered Christianity, and that we need to do more to create a welcoming [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3139.28s)]
*  environment for faith in our country. It is not necessary for us to insist that every single mom [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3146.0800000000004s)]
*  and pop bakery cater same-sex marriages. We just don't need to do that. We should include [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3152.0800000000004s)]
*  people of faith in our diversity and inclusion programs, the right kinds, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3160.32s)]
*  we're workplaces and universities, just make sure that people can feel relatively welcome. We [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3164.96s)]
*  should be curious about people of faith. I know a lot of Christians who told me when I started [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3169.36s)]
*  working on this book that they're on the down-low at work about their faith, not because of a war [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3175.44s)]
*  in Christianity, not because of discrimination, but just because it's seen as kind of weird. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3182.4s)]
*  I think the same is true of Orthodox Jews and a lot of other people. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3187.76s)]
*  You? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3191.36s)]
*  It's on us, I think, me specifically, to go out of our way to show curiosity about faith. It [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3192.56s)]
*  wouldn't hurt us to accompany a Christian to church, for example. So, secular America, I think [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3199.52s)]
*  it's starting to wake up. I'm just part of a movement. There are others who are saying, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3208.6400000000003s)]
*  hey, wait a minute, we missed the boat here in secular world. And then the other question is, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3213.36s)]
*  what can Christians do? And I guess that's really the question you're asking. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3218.24s)]
*  And there, even as chutzpah-dick as I am, I don't know how to- [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3222.08s)]
*  I've really unleashed a beast there. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3227.6s)]
*  I don't know how to prescribe to them. And I don't think they'd even listen to me. So, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3230.8799999999997s)]
*  my message to them is simpler. It's like, open your Bible, look at Matthew 4, look at the church, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3235.2s)]
*  ask yourself, is this what Jesus wants? And then maybe listen to the pleas of a secular American [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3242.64s)]
*  who says, guys, Christianity is the next great mission field of the church. That's how a [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3248.72s)]
*  evangelical pastor put it to me. It's about retaking evangelicals for the word of Jesus. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3255.7599999999998s)]
*  The best hope is that Christianity has run aground many times in the past. You know, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3266.72s)]
*  think about Christendom and the abuses of the church and indulgences and merger, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3271.36s)]
*  all of those things. And yet, one thing we know about the gospel of Jesus is that this incredible, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3277.44s)]
*  counterintuitive story of a God in human form who gives his life in the worst, most painful, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3285.76s)]
*  torturous possible way to redeem the people in hopes that they will imitate him, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3296.0s)]
*  this has proved to be the most powerful single narrative in the history of the world. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3303.92s)]
*  So, maybe it's not exhausted. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3308.16s)]
*  But how have you not convinced yourself early in this conversation you said, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3310.4s)]
*  there's two core questions in human existence that secularism cannot answer. Why am I here? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3314.8s)]
*  And what is good and evil? And you still, having written this book, identify yourself as a secular [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3321.12s)]
*  atheist. Why not become a part of the solution? Why not become a believer with the kind of values [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3329.92s)]
*  you're, you know, persuading others to abide by? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3337.44s)]
*  Well, I should say just for the record, and in defense of my tribal identity, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3341.12s)]
*  I'm also very much a Jew. And that would impede me from being a Christian. This is the faith of [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3345.84s)]
*  my ancestors. Going back 3,000 years, it's in my blood and it's not something that I feel can change. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3351.84s)]
*  And I think many of your listeners will understand that. So that's one reason. Another is that [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3358.32s)]
*  I realized three things very early in life, like grade school. One is this irrepressible attraction [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3366.48s)]
*  to boys and men at a very early age. Another was that I was Jewish. We had a good little tight [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3374.16s)]
*  Jewish community in Phoenix where I grew up. I went to Hebrew school for years. But the third [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3382.0s)]
*  was that I could not believe in God. And I did try at one point, it just never made any sense to me. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3387.68s)]
*  It didn't answer my questions. Like, why would a good, all-powerful God allow the Holocaust? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3392.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3398.96s)]
*  You know, where was he? Free will doesn't really get you there. It doesn't solve smallpox. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3399.28s)]
*  But I came to see the big change in me, Barry, which I think is reflected in this book, is [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3406.4s)]
*  at one point I was someone who is kind of smug about my atheism. I'm not one of those weak [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3413.28s)]
*  people who need the crutch of religion. I'm perfectly happy standing on my own two feet [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3418.72s)]
*  in a world that's full of mysteries and uncertainties. And that's still true to some extent, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3423.12s)]
*  but I have come to realize that what I have is it's like a kind of deficit. Maybe it's like [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3427.36s)]
*  being colorblind. There are dimensions of life, spiritual and moral dimensions of life, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3431.84s)]
*  that people who are way smarter than I am, Francis Collins, one of the great scientists of our time, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3438.96s)]
*  have the capacity to have faith and also be deeply grounded in the material world in the [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3445.76s)]
*  way that I just don't. And so I have just come to see, you know, I guess I'm not wired that way. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3454.0s)]
*  I would no longer dream of persuading a Christian to become an atheist. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3460.64s)]
*  You know, for the person that says, Donathan Rausch, how do you get off as a non-believing, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3465.36s)]
*  non-Christian telling us what to do inside our Christian world? Our belief, our world of [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3471.52s)]
*  believers, you're an outsider. You don't even believe in God. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3480.8s)]
*  I don't even believe in God. I'm not a Christian. Yeah, we've used the newly coined word, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3485.92s)]
*  many times, and I'm well aware of that. But my answer to that is that you don't need to [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  believe that Jesus Christ is your personal Lord and Savior to read the Gospels and see the profound [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3504.1600000000003s)]
*  importance and rightness of his teaching. Those three things I talked about earlier, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3510.56s)]
*  the pillars of Christianity that are also pillars of liberalism. Don't be afraid, be like Jesus, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3515.84s)]
*  especially be egalitarian and observe the rights of all and forgive each other. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3522.72s)]
*  I think those are important and may be crucial for all humans, whether Christian or not. And I think [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3528.48s)]
*  that secular people can and should look to Christian inspiration and have for many years. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3537.12s)]
*  And so when I say that I'm disappointed in the path that the church has taken away from [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3544.3199999999997s)]
*  what it says or its core values, I offer that as an observation, and maybe I'm wrong. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3548.88s)]
*  But I will stand on the ground as saying that you don't have to be a Christian to believe [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3556.16s)]
*  that Christ had some things, some very important things right. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3563.44s)]
*  There's a tweet that I thought a lot about since Ross Douthat, who was recently on this show, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3567.3599999999997s)]
*  put out, I think it was in 2016. And he said this, a thought sent back in time to the theocracy [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3575.12s)]
*  panic of 2005. If you dislike the religious right, wait till you meet the post-religious right. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3581.44s)]
*  And this is something I've been thinking about a lot because as, you know, I remember growing up [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3589.7599999999998s)]
*  and the demons, the villains of, you know, broadly liberal, certainly progressive [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3595.76s)]
*  culture. And that was, of course, my culture were people like Rick Santorum, people like Mike Pence. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3607.36s)]
*  Now they seem quaint to me when I look at the sort of Nietzschean, pagan, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3614.6400000000003s)]
*  almost neo-eugenicist movement that is rising on the right right now. And I would love to you just [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3622.64s)]
*  hear you reflect a little bit on that because, you know, that to me is one of the grave threats [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3630.24s)]
*  that is ascendant that I don't think most people fully understand of what could come after a kind [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3638.16s)]
*  of religious right. It's not what could come. It's what's coming right now. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3646.96s)]
*  So I especially address this to members of a free press audience because the free press has been in [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3653.6s)]
*  the forefront of exposing and sounding the alarm about the postmodern left. That's postmodern left [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  is not new. You know, it goes back to deconstructionists and you know all that back in the 70s. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3667.76s)]
*  But we've seen the corrosive effect that it's had in university world and increasingly in corporate [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3673.12s)]
*  world, media world and elsewhere. What we're looking at now is the postmodern right. And so [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3680.96s)]
*  there's a lot to that. We could talk about it for an hour. But to me, the simplest definition of [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3688.24s)]
*  postmodernism, whether on the left or the right is it subordinates truth to power. It says, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3693.52s)]
*  what we're all about is behind everything, everything is a mask for power. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3701.12s)]
*  And what you want is to maximize your power, your domination. And we're seeing that, I think, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3707.6s)]
*  maybe controversial, I don't know. But we're seeing that in the will to power of this administration. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3715.2s)]
*  We're seeing it in the subordination of truth to power. This is an administration that says, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3721.68s)]
*  we don't care about the actual facts. We're going to say that this person is a terrorist and deport [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3726.56s)]
*  him on that basis. And then when someone points out that that's not true, we're not going to say, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3731.92s)]
*  oops, we're going to say, we don't care. It's true if we say it. They pick this up from the left. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3736.08s)]
*  But now it's on the right. And wherever you see this kind of postmodernism will to power, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  you see a world in which the ordinary guardrails don't work, the appeal to truth, the appeal to [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3748.64s)]
*  liberal values, the appeal to minority rights, to restraint, to all of the things that we've [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3757.44s)]
*  been talking about for the last hour go out the window when you get into postmodern world. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3762.56s)]
*  So now I, and maybe you, and maybe a lot of people listening to this, find ourselves in [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3768.4s)]
*  this environment where we have the postmodern left on one side and we have the postmodern right on [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3772.48s)]
*  the other. And we are trying to recover the ground for liberalism. And my hope in writing this book [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3777.44s)]
*  is to bring more Christians and more of Christianity itself into that fight. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3785.84s)]
*  LW Thank you so much for coming on the show. It's a perfect place to end. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3791.44s)]
*  JN Thank you. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXGr8snJ5s&t=3796.96s)]
