On Tuesday night, president-elect Donald Trump announced that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will head a new initiative in the Trump administration: the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE.”

Aside from the very strange fact that internet meme culture has now landed in the White House—Dogecoin is a memecoin—more importantly, what the announcement solidifies is the triumph of the counter-elite. A bunch of oddball outsiders ran against an insular band of out-of-touch elites supported by every celebrity in Hollywood—and they won. And they are about to reshape not just the government but also the culture in ways we can’t imagine.

And there was one person I wanted to discuss it with. He is the vanguard of those antiestablishment counter-elites: Peter Thiel.

On the surface, Thiel is someone who seems full of contradictions. He is a libertarian who has found common cause with nationalists and populists. He likes investing in companies that have the ability to become monopolies, and yet Trump’s White House wants to break up Big Tech. He is a gay American immigrant, but he hates identity politics and the culture wars. He pays people to drop out of college, but, in this conversation at least, still seems to venerate the way that the Ivy Leagues are an indicator of intelligence.

But perhaps that’s the secret to his success: He’s beholden to no tribe but himself, no ideology but his own. 

Today: Thiel explains why so many of his peers have finally come around to Trump; why he thinks Kamala—and liberalism more broadly—lost the election; and why the Trump 2.0 team will be better than last time, with antiestablishment figures who are willing to rethink the system. We talk about the border, trade deals, student debt, Israel and foreign policy, the rise of historical revisionism, the blurry line between skepticism and conspiracy, and his contrarian ideas about what we might face in a dreaded World War III.

# Peter Thiel on the Triumph of the Counter-Elites
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y)
*  From the Free Press, this is honestly an I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump announcing the appointments of additional members of his administration today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4.0s)]
*  Tonight, Trump announcing that a Department of Government Efficiency will be led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=10.0s)]
*  On Tuesday night, Donald Trump announced that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=18.0s)]
*  along with entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, will head a new department in the Trump administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=23.0s)]
*  They're calling it the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=31.0s)]
*  DOGE coin is surging, as you might know, following the president-elect's victory, getting an extra boost following some headlines around Elon Musk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=36.0s)]
*  So we saw DOGE coin surge as much as 20% on Tuesday night, right after Donald Trump formally announced the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=43.0s)]
*  which he called DOGE in a hat tip to the dog-themed meme coin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=50.0s)]
*  Aside from the very strange fact that Internet meme culture has now landed in the White House, DOGE coin is a meme coin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=54.0s)]
*  And if you don't understand what I just said, fear not. I'm sure Nellie will cover it in TGIF tomorrow. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=61.0s)]
*  But what the announcement solidifies, if Trump's win hadn't already, is the triumph of the counter-elite. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=66.0s)]
*  In other words, a bunch of oddball outsiders pulled together, got behind Trump, and ran against an insular band of out-of-touch elites [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=73.0s)]
*  supported by every celebrity in Hollywood. And the oddballs won. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=83.0s)]
*  And they're about to reshape not just the government, but also American culture in ways I don't think we can fully imagine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=89.0s)]
*  How they did that and why is a question that I've been thinking about pretty much nonstop since last Tuesday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=98.0s)]
*  And there was one person, more than any other, that I wanted to discuss it with. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=105.0s)]
*  And that is the vanguard of those anti-establishment counter-elites, Peter Thiel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=110.0s)]
*  People describe the billionaire venture capitalist in very colorful terms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=116.0s)]
*  He's been called the most successful tech investor in the world and also a political kingmaker. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=120.0s)]
*  Others call him the boogeyman of the left. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=126.0s)]
*  But he is the center of gravity, at least in a certain part of Silicon Valley, and he's created a kind of world around him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=129.0s)]
*  There's the Thielverse, Thielbucks, and Thielus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=137.0s)]
*  To say he's an obsessive cult following would be an understatement. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=141.0s)]
*  If you listened to my last conversation with Thiel a year and a half ago on this show, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=145.0s)]
*  you'll remember that Peter was the first person in Silicon Valley to publicly embrace Trump in 2016. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm Peter Thiel. I build companies and I support people who are building new things from social networks to rocket ships. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm not a politician, but neither is Donald Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=165.0s)]
*  He is a builder and it's time to rebuild America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=170.0s)]
*  That year, he gave a very memorable speech at the RNC. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=174.0s)]
*  Every American has a unique identity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=179.0s)]
*  I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=182.0s)]
*  A speech that many in his orbit thought was a step way too far. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=187.0s)]
*  And he suffered for it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=192.0s)]
*  He lost business at the startup incubator Y Combinator, where he was a partner. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=194.0s)]
*  Many prominent tech leaders criticized him publicly, like VC and Twitter investor Chris Saka, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=198.0s)]
*  who called Thiel's endorsement of Trump one of the most dangerous things he had ever seen. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=204.0s)]
*  Jason Calacanis, one of the hosts of the All In podcast, wrote at the time, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=210.0s)]
*  If you are backing Trump, you are choosing the side of hate, racism and misogyny. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=214.0s)]
*  There is no compromise on this issue, Calacanis wrote. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=220.0s)]
*  It's not a difference of political opinion. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=224.0s)]
*  It's about what kind of human being you want to be. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, a lot has changed since then. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=230.0s)]
*  For one, Thiel has taken a step back from politics, at least publicly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=233.0s)]
*  He didn't donate to Trump's campaign this time around, and there was no big RNC speech. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=238.0s)]
*  But the bigger change, I'd argue, is a cultural one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=243.0s)]
*  Thiel is no longer the pariah of Silicon Valley for supporting Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=246.0s)]
*  There's Bill Ackman, Mark Andreessen, David Sacks, Sean Maguire, and of course, Elon Musk, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=250.0s)]
*  among many other tech titans, some of whom used to support the Democrats who have joined the Trump train. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=257.0s)]
*  On the surface, Thiel is someone who seems full of contradictions, or at least paradoxes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=263.0s)]
*  He's a libertarian who has found common cause with nationalists and populists. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=268.0s)]
*  He likes investing in companies that have the ability to become monopolies, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=273.0s)]
*  and yet Trump's White House wants to break up big tech. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=277.0s)]
*  He's a gay American immigrant, but he hates identity politics and also the culture wars. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=280.0s)]
*  He pays people to drop out of college, but also, in this conversation, seems to still venerate the Ivy League. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=286.0s)]
*  But perhaps that's the secret to his success. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=293.0s)]
*  He's beholden to no tribe but himself, no ideology but his own. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=296.0s)]
*  And why wouldn't you be when you make so many winning bets? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=301.0s)]
*  From co-founding the e-payment behemoth PayPal and the data analytics firm Palantir, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=305.0s)]
*  which was used to find Osama bin Laden, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=310.0s)]
*  to being the first outside investor in Facebook, Thiel's investments in companies like LinkedIn, Palantir, and SpaceX, to name a few, have paid off big time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=313.0s)]
*  His most recent bet, helping his mentee JD Vance get elected Senator of Ohio and then Vice President of the United States, seems to have paid off big time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=323.0s)]
*  I guess the next four years will determine just how high Thiel's profit margin will be. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=335.0s)]
*  Today, Peter Thiel explains why so many of his peers have finally come around to Trump, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=340.0s)]
*  why he thinks Kamala and liberalism more broadly lost the election. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=345.0s)]
*  We talk about the southern border, tariffs and trade deals, student debt, Israel and foreign policy, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=350.0s)]
*  the rise of historical revisionism on the right, the blurry line between skepticism and conspiracy, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=357.0s)]
*  and his contrarian ideas about what a dreaded World War III might look like. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=363.0s)]
*  This is a conversation you will not want to miss. Stay with us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=369.0s)]
*  Peter Thiel, welcome to Honestly. Thanks for having me, Barry. Thanks for making the time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=379.0s)]
*  Okay, we last spoke, I don't know if you remember this, we were in Miami. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=383.0s)]
*  It was May of 2023, and the world was a very different place. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=387.0s)]
*  Joe Biden was the president and he was the presumptive Democratic nominee. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=391.0s)]
*  There was a Republican primary underway. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=396.0s)]
*  You were supporting Ron DeSantis, but you weren't being very loud about it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=398.0s)]
*  And, you know, Trump was sort of on the outs with a lot of people. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=402.0s)]
*  The amount that has changed over the past year and a half is profound. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=407.0s)]
*  Six months after our conversation, October 7th happened. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=411.0s)]
*  It felt like the world sort of shifted on its axis. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=414.0s)]
*  Then Trump won the GOP nomination in July. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=418.0s)]
*  Biden dropped out of the race. Kamala was coronated. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=421.0s)]
*  Of course, Trump survived this wild assassination attempt near my hometown in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=424.0s)]
*  And then last week was the election. And Trump not only won the White House, he won the popular vote. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=430.0s)]
*  And now it looks like the Republicans are poised to control all three branches of government. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=437.0s)]
*  I think it's an understatement to say that we're living in a changed world. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=441.0s)]
*  I think, and the reason that I wanted to sit down with you today is that you saw so many of those changes coming. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=445.0s)]
*  And you can make an argument that you maybe saw them even too early. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=452.0s)]
*  So I want to start with kind of a broad question, which is how are you feeling about this political moment that we're in? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=456.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say I'm ecstatic, but I'm relieved. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=463.0s)]
*  I think I would be incredibly depressed if the election had gone the other way. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=466.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's probably a little bit asymmetric. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=470.0s)]
*  I'm less happy than I would be unhappy had it gone the other way. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=473.0s)]
*  You know, I never actually supported DeSantis. I did meet with him a couple of times, maybe toyed with the idea a little bit. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=479.0s)]
*  DeSantis felt promising in early 2021 when he was sort of the courageous COVID governor. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=486.0s)]
*  And by early 2023, it felt like he was a little bit too locked in on these on these culture wars. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=492.0s)]
*  And I didn't believe that that was, you know, they're important, but they're not the most important thing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=500.0s)]
*  And so it already felt very, very off in early in early 2023 to me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=506.0s)]
*  Were you surprised by what happened on Tuesday night? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=512.0s)]
*  Because some have credited you for predicting it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=515.0s)]
*  You said it was going to kind of be a blowout in one direction or the other. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=517.0s)]
*  I didn't think it was going to be that close. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=520.0s)]
*  And and I suppose I didn't think that Harris was going to win by a big margin. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=522.0s)]
*  So if you combine those two things, it's a way of saying that I thought it was going to be a solid win for Trump. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=526.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, he was way behind in the polls in 2016 and 2020, and both of those were, you know, extremely close. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=532.0s)]
*  And if you just believe that the polls hadn't been fully adjusted and they hadn't fully corrected whatever mistake they were making in the polling from four or eight years ago and the polls were even, that suggested, you know, that's just it was going to be a very, very solid win. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=541.0s)]
*  And then and then on some level, I think it was just a collapse of liberalism. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=557.0s)]
*  Say more. I mean, of liberalism or of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=562.0s)]
*  I think it's too narrow to blame it on, you know, a somewhat senile Biden and a somewhat goofy Kamala Harris. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=567.0s)]
*  And it was sort of just a, you know, somehow it was just this much broader collapse. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=576.0s)]
*  It feels like a much more decisive election. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=581.0s)]
*  You know, in a way you can say in 2016, Trump beat the Republicans, the Bush Republicans, and he sort of maybe lucked out or snuck by Hillary and she didn't take him seriously at all. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=583.0s)]
*  You can't say that about 2024. Everyone knew it was going to be the Midwest states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=597.0s)]
*  The Democrats gave it their all. They spent two or three times as much money as Trump spent the last three, four months. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=604.0s)]
*  And it just didn't work. They certainly the institutions tried to prosecute him, prosecute him criminally. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=611.0s)]
*  They tried to take him off the ballot. They tried to stop him in every way possible. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=619.0s)]
*  And so unlike 2016, this time it was Trump against the Democrats. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=624.0s)]
*  The Democrats gave it their all and it just collapsed. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=629.0s)]
*  You know, one other dimension of it that's so many different observations one can make, but one other dimension of it that I find striking is that if we talked about this in 2016, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=634.0s)]
*  would be, you know, the Republicans are this party of white voters and old voters and they're going to die. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=645.0s)]
*  And eventually they'll be replaced by younger and more diverse Democrats. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=652.0s)]
*  This is the whole demographics is destiny argument. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=657.0s)]
*  And so for Trump to be able in eight years is actually a long time. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=659.0s)]
*  And there are, you know, a lot of Republican voters from 2016 who are not alive anymore. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=663.0s)]
*  And so for Trump to be able to win in 2024 and by a much more significant margin, at least in the popular vote than in 2016, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=668.0s)]
*  it means you had to change the minds of millions of people and you had to do something that if you believe that demographics destiny or identity politics means that people cannot listen to reason. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=679.0s)]
*  And it's all subject to these sub rational factors like your race or your gender or your sexual orientation or something like this, then nobody would ever be able to change their mind. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=690.0s)]
*  You exploded the lie of identity politics that, you know, your identity matters more than the argument or the case. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=700.0s)]
*  And Trump made an argument. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=710.0s)]
*  J.D. Manz made an argument. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=712.0s)]
*  They made a made a strong case. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=714.0s)]
*  And I think there was no argument on the Democratic side. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=716.0s)]
*  It was it was free of substance, free of ideas. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=720.0s)]
*  You know, people people say that that that Harris struggled in saying how she was different from Biden, how she was substantively different from Biden. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=723.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's that that's that's too narrow way of putting it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=733.0s)]
*  She had nothing to say of substance on anything. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=737.0s)]
*  So obviously, if you have zero substance, there's also zero substantive difference with Biden. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=740.0s)]
*  I want to pick up on the idea of the Democratic Party, maybe even liberalism collapsed. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=744.0s)]
*  It's one striking there's there's so many striking visuals of this campaign. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=748.0s)]
*  I think one of them is when you look at the murderers row of celebrities and the pretty people that were lined up behind the Democratic ticket, whether it's it's literally everyone. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=754.0s)]
*  It's Oprah. It's Beyonce. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=767.0s)]
*  It's you name a Hollywood celebrity. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=768.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=770.0s)]
*  And on the other side, yes, you had a few sort of dissidents from the elite like Elon Musk. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=772.0s)]
*  But you had, you know, podcasters. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=778.0s)]
*  You had my pillow guy. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=781.0s)]
*  You had, you know, not anyone that people would maybe choose if they were thinking about who to to seek endorsements from this sort of Curry's popular favor. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=783.0s)]
*  What does that say about like where the culture is? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, these things are always very overdetermined. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=796.0s)]
*  But but I would say it tells us that celebrity isn't what it used to be. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=799.0s)]
*  And celebrity used to have a certain mystique. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=804.0s)]
*  And it has been somewhat deconstructed. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=807.0s)]
*  And we, you know, we think of a lot of the Hollywood celebrities, a lot of the, you know, music celebrities as as just these, you know, left wing ditto heads. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=811.0s)]
*  And, you know, they may be smart people. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=824.0s)]
*  They're not allowed to articulate smart things. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=827.0s)]
*  They're not allowed to be individuals. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=830.0s)]
*  And, you know, one of the striking thing is I don't think there is room for individual thought left on the left. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=832.0s)]
*  And it's certainly not in Hollywood. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=842.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, Hollywood in the 1990s, it was liberal. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=845.0s)]
*  But, you know, behind closed doors, you could say very transgressive things. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=848.0s)]
*  And you realize it was this liberal show you were putting on. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=852.0s)]
*  And then there are parts of it you believed and parts of it that you could question. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=855.0s)]
*  I don't think people are able to have conversations, even in small groups at dinners behind closed doors in a liberal context. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=858.0s)]
*  People are not allowed to think for themselves. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=866.0s)]
*  Same thing for university professors. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=869.0s)]
*  You know, when I was I know when I was at Stanford in the 80s, early 90s, it was overwhelmingly liberal. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=872.0s)]
*  But you had a lot of thoughtful liberals. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=880.0s)]
*  There were still such a thing as an eccentric university professor. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=882.0s)]
*  And that's a species that's basically gone extinct. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=886.0s)]
*  And and then we can go down, you know, down the list of institutions. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=889.0s)]
*  You know, there were, you know, there were elder statesmen type figures. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=894.0s)]
*  People have been in the government for a long time and were very thoughtful and had had a good nuanced perspective. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=898.0s)]
*  And there are all these ways this was more true on the left, on the Democratic side, on the liberal side than the Republican side. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=905.0s)]
*  The progressives thought of themselves as more elite and the smarter people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=913.0s)]
*  And and and but there's just no individuality left whatsoever. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=917.0s)]
*  And then, you know, the story of people like Elon or Tulsi Gabbard or R.F.K. Junior, maybe yourself is is at some point this sort of straitjacket where you're just joining the Borg is not what you signed up when when you started as liberals. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=924.0s)]
*  You know, I've known Elon since 2000, 24, almost 25 years. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=944.0s)]
*  And, you know, he was not never doctrinaire, but for the first 20 years, you know, he was left of center. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=949.0s)]
*  You know, it was Tesla's clean energy electric vehicle company. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=958.0s)]
*  The Republicans were these people who didn't believe in climate change. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=965.0s)]
*  And so it was it was sort of naturally much more comfortable in sort of deep blue, Democratic California. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=969.0s)]
*  And then at some point, Elon shifted and it's overdetermined why he shifted or why you shifted or some of these other people did. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=978.0s)]
*  I didn't shift, Peter. Everyone else just moved. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=987.0s)]
*  But everyone feels that way, of course. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=990.0s)]
*  But but but and I know these things are overdetermined, but I but I keep thinking part of it is just this sort of straitjacket is not what you all signed up for. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=993.0s)]
*  This intellectual straitjacket where you're not allowed to have ideas, even if you agree with 80 percent, it's never enough. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1003.0s)]
*  You have to be 100 percent. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1009.0s)]
*  And one of the other metaphors I've used is that, you know, the left, the Democratic Party, it's like the empire. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1011.0s)]
*  They're all imperial stormtroopers. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1020.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're we're the ragtag rebel alliance. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1023.0s)]
*  And it is a it's a uncomfortably diverse heterogenous group. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1026.0s)]
*  And you have, you know, I don't know, a teenage Chewbacca and Princess Leia type character. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1031.0s)]
*  And then we have, you know, we have a autistic C3PO policy wonk person. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1038.0s)]
*  And it is a, you know, it's a ragtag rebel alliance against the empire. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1044.0s)]
*  I thought a lot about I don't know if you were into the Hunger Games in the same way you were into Star Wars. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1050.0s)]
*  But like a lot of to me, like the people that I know that either sat out this that were reliable Democrats and liberals who either sat out this election or voted Trump for the first time did not do it because they like Donald Trump. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1054.0s)]
*  Most of them find him abhorrent. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1068.0s)]
*  They did it because they wanted to give a middle finger to the Capitol, like in the Hunger Games analogy, because they felt all of the things you're describing. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1071.0s)]
*  And I think one of the things I'm thinking about in the aftermath of the election is, you know, will the Democrats sort of double down on all of the narratives and the myths that have landed them in this place? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1080.0s)]
*  You can watch it right now on MSNBC, where they're still talking about they're somehow finding a way to look at black voters going to the right Latino men, especially going to the right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1094.0s)]
*  And somehow it's still a story of misogyny and white supremacy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1105.0s)]
*  Or are they going to sort of spend their time in the wilderness regrouping in much of the way the Democrats did sort of after Carter's loss? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1108.0s)]
*  And then, of course, you have like, you know, Al Fromm and James Carville, et cetera, building the Clinton machine. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1116.0s)]
*  Yeah, that took that took 12 years. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1122.0s)]
*  It took took a long time. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1124.0s)]
*  I don't I don't know, but I I wonder, I worry that the sort of skill for introspection reflection thought has just really, really atrophied. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1128.0s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's, but isn't losing a very good lesson in it should be. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1142.0s)]
*  It should be. But, you know, somehow the Democrat, it's a long history. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1149.0s)]
*  But, you know, the Clintons in the 90s, it was it was triangulation, which was maybe a little bit nihilistic, moderate compromise seeking. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1153.0s)]
*  But behind closed doors, I think you had, you know, very smart people in the Clinton administration who had debates and were able to articulate things. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1163.0s)]
*  Then you got to some centrist consensus view. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1172.0s)]
*  And there was a big shift with Obama in 2008. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1176.0s)]
*  And, you know, in a way, you could say there were only two people in the Obama administration, two two individuals, him and her. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1179.0s)]
*  And, you know, everybody else was just an NPC. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1187.0s)]
*  You were just going with the Borg. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1192.0s)]
*  And it was it was very quickly figured out what the consensus was. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1194.0s)]
*  And then it was rigidly enforced. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1199.0s)]
*  And it had a certain power. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1202.0s)]
*  But then there were all these ways it went very wrong. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1205.0s)]
*  And and then, you know, and then the Obama legacy was that, you know, you got Hillary Clinton in 2016. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1209.0s)]
*  You know, probably Biden was their best candidate in 2020 was almost blocked by Obama. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1217.0s)]
*  And then in twenty four, you ended up with with Harris, who, you know, was sort of pushed by Obama and both as VP and then for president this last summer. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1222.0s)]
*  For my mom, who I know listens to the show and NPC as a non-player character, it's sort of like a zombie. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1232.0s)]
*  It's like a zombie like a zombie. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1238.0s)]
*  I think in 2020, everyone, maybe not everyone, but many people, even those who supported Trump, could tell themselves a story that his presidency was some kind of anomaly. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1240.0s)]
*  Now, I think with this overwhelming victory, historians are going to be telling themselves a very different story. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1252.0s)]
*  Well, it was the 2020 was the fluke. Right. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1259.0s)]
*  Explain that. Well, it's this is what seemed important to me about the 2024 election, because I think the Hollywood movie termination. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1262.0s)]
*  The Hollywood movie term is red conning, retroactive continuity. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1269.0s)]
*  And it's it's like you have a you have a popular character who dies in an avalanche, but the people want him back. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1273.0s)]
*  And then we somehow find a way for him to survive and make it back. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1278.0s)]
*  And you may and then you come up with a way to make it retroactively continuous. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1282.0s)]
*  So we have to tell a story of what happened the last eight years. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1287.0s)]
*  And if Harris had won, the story would have been 2016 was a fluke. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1291.0s)]
*  We can ignore it. And, you know, liberalism is basically fine. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1298.0s)]
*  And we can go back to the sort of somewhat brain dead, but comfortable Obama consensus. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1303.0s)]
*  And and it seems to me that the straightforward, retroactively continuous story is that 2020 was the fluke. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1310.0s)]
*  And it was it was one last time for this on scene regime with, you know, on scene President Biden to daughter over the finish line one last time. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1320.0s)]
*  But it was not, you know, it's not a sign of health at all. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1334.0s)]
*  You were able to put it together through all these paradoxes. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1338.0s)]
*  You know, maybe one of the one of the crazy paradoxes of of the diversity politics is that it is that if one of the lessons of the last three elections for Democrats is maybe they can only elect old straight white men. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1343.0s)]
*  And and the logic of it would be that if you if you if you go with a diverse person, you always have to go with a specific category. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1362.0s)]
*  Say Kamala Harris is a black woman. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1372.0s)]
*  But maybe that doesn't mean that much from myself as a gay guy or maybe maybe it's alienating to Latinos or something like this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1375.0s)]
*  And so as soon as you concretize this abstract idea of a diverse person into a specific person, you lose way more people than you get. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1385.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. It's maybe seven percent of our population are black women. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1394.0s)]
*  And so maybe Harris helps with seven percent. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1399.0s)]
*  And but then isn't the logic of identity politics that it should hurt you with the other 93 percent? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1403.0s)]
*  If you say you should vote for candidate X because candidate X shares your trait. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1409.0s)]
*  But I think one of the interesting things about this election, unlike the Hillary Clinton election, which was all about sort of girl boss lean in female power empowerment, Kamala Harris, you know, almost didn't talk about it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1415.0s)]
*  No, it obviously didn't work anymore. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1428.0s)]
*  But I think I think the last time the identity politics worked for real was probably the 2008 election with with Obama. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1431.0s)]
*  And it worked because in 2008, we're still in a pre Internet world and a pre Internet world meant you could tell one message to one group of people and a different message to a different group of people. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1439.0s)]
*  And so for black voters, Obama could say he was a black person and they should vote for him because he was black like them. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1452.0s)]
*  And to white voters, Obama could say he was a post racial person and they should vote for him because he was post racial. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1458.0s)]
*  By the time you get to 2016, it doesn't actually work. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1465.0s)]
*  Yeah, Hillary can't tell, you know, women to vote for her because she's a woman and men to vote for her because she's a post gender person or something like that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1470.0s)]
*  And, you know, the sort of micro targeting Mark Penn political strategy from the 90s was way past its sell by date 2016. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1481.0s)]
*  So, yes, somehow, although I will say both presidential candidates, interestingly, in this election sort of had one message for Arab Muslim voters, certainly in parts of Michigan and a very different message for Jewish voters in the same state. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1490.0s)]
*  So I'm just wondering if the rule always holds. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1506.0s)]
*  That one is that one is complicated, I suppose. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1510.0s)]
*  And we can analyze in a lot of ways, but I suppose it's it's it's evidence of just the total collapse of the Democratic Party. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1516.0s)]
*  If you lose ground among both the Jews and Muslims, how do you do that? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1525.0s)]
*  And and and I can come up with all sorts of ways to explain it. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1530.0s)]
*  But let's just say as a fact, it sort of suggests to you that while if you can't even game with one of those groups at the expense of the other, this whole identity politics thing has gone super, super haywire. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1536.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's you know, Kamala didn't know how to how to talk about it in the right way. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1550.0s)]
*  And maybe maybe there was there was no way no good way to do it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1557.0s)]
*  But but I don't think this is a conversation they can have on the Democratic side because Biden was the compromise. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1561.0s)]
*  He was the old straight white male. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1567.0s)]
*  And the promise was he's going to be the last one we'll ever have. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1570.0s)]
*  We need him this one time to get through in 2020. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1573.0s)]
*  So somehow they knew that this was the most electable person in 2020. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1575.0s)]
*  And then, of course, we'll get a more diverse person after Biden. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1580.0s)]
*  But then sort of two, three, four, twenty, twenty three. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1584.0s)]
*  Wow. It's anybody post Biden is worse than Biden. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1588.0s)]
*  And then it's only when the senility really, really catches up that we have to do something. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1591.0s)]
*  And then and then somehow the consensus shifted very quickly to we don't have time for a primary. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1597.0s)]
*  Therefore, we have to go with Kamala Harris. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1603.0s)]
*  Harris, therefore, we have to have this wishful thinking that she's the most wonderful candidate ever, even though that's not something we believe for the three and a half years before. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1606.0s)]
*  And and then, you know, it works for a few weeks, but then unravels pretty, pretty badly, as we all saw. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1614.0s)]
*  Just one hypo. And then I'll move on. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1621.0s)]
*  I guess I'm curious if you think the X factor in this election was Trump or Kamala's weakness. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1624.0s)]
*  In other words, if Trump had been running against, let's say, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro or someone like a Westmore or perhaps even a Gavin Newsom, would it still have been a blowout? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1630.0s)]
*  It's always hard to do these counterfactuals, but my intuition is that it was it was a it was a broader failing of the Democratic Party was not just Biden's fault. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1641.0s)]
*  It was not just Harris's fault. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1653.0s)]
*  I don't think I think all these people are not that impressive. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1656.0s)]
*  You know, if we if we go with elite credentialing, you know, J.D. Vance went to Yale Law School. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1662.0s)]
*  If President Trump were here, he would tell you he went to Penn. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1671.0s)]
*  It's an Ivy League school. Yes, he would. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1675.0s)]
*  You can't you can't be a dummy. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1677.0s)]
*  And they only take the smart as the smart people there. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1679.0s)]
*  And he would tell you that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1681.0s)]
*  And and, you know, I don't know, in the 90s, you know, I think it was the first time that I've ever seen a president like that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1683.0s)]
*  I don't know. In the 90s, Bill Clinton was Yale Law Rhodes Scholar. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1690.0s)]
*  Obama was Harvard Law. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1695.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was Yale Law. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1697.0s)]
*  They had impressive elite credentials. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1699.0s)]
*  And there was a collapse with Biden. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1702.0s)]
*  I think in retrospect, we can say it was a transition from smart to dumb or elite to non-elite. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1705.0s)]
*  And it was University of Delaware. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1712.0s)]
*  And then Kamalo is Howard, UC Hastings Law School, Walsh, even dumber, even more mediocre. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1714.0s)]
*  And there is nothing elite left. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1724.0s)]
*  And I think I, you know, I don't know. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1726.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom was University of Santa Clara. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1728.0s)]
*  Not a very elite place at all. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1730.0s)]
*  Shapiro was a little bit smarter, but it's like Georgetown Law School, which is still a lot less elite than than. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1733.0s)]
*  This is hilarious because you're someone who does not believe in the like in the fact that these places should still hold the prestige that they do. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1742.0s)]
*  You think that they're corrupt and rotten. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1750.0s)]
*  So square the paradox that's coming through here. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1752.0s)]
*  I can believe they're corrupt and rotten and that they still select for very smart people and and and find it amazing that the Democrats no longer believe in them and that they've come around to my point of view, that there's or maybe that they're so rotten. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1756.0s)]
*  That they are no longer good places to learn how to defend liberalism. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1771.0s)]
*  Maybe maybe they're good places for training conservatives. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1776.0s)]
*  You know, if you go to Yale Law School, if you're one of, you know, five people in the class of one hundred seventy who's still conservative at the end, you'll be pretty good at understanding what's wrong with liberalism. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1779.0s)]
*  You'll have thought about it a lot and you'll be a more thoughtful person. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1791.0s)]
*  And so it will actually train you well to be a conservative. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1794.0s)]
*  And we're right to to value the, you know, the small number of conservatives who come out of that that gauntlet as quite talented people. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1797.0s)]
*  But, you know, if you're if you're a liberal and you graduate from from any of these places, I don't think you would do a better job defending liberalism. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1805.0s)]
*  And it wouldn't sound, you know, so I don't know. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1815.0s)]
*  I know who the smartest young liberals are. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1817.0s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg. If you try to make him square the circle and defend the incredible deficits, the inflation, you know, the out of control border, you know, all the substantive policy that were wrong, it would be more embarrassing than Harris because we expect Buttigieg to be smart. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1819.0s)]
*  And it would just show how incoherent it is. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1836.0s)]
*  You know, if it's word salad coming out of Harris, maybe we can blame it on Harris. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1839.0s)]
*  If you had someone really smart, it would be more embarrassing. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1844.0s)]
*  So maybe maybe the liberals were correct to say they could no longer pick someone from an elite school because it would it would sort of blow up all of liberalism, whereas now we can still pretend that it was just the fault of Biden or Harris. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1847.0s)]
*  I think although I think it was much broader than that. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1860.0s)]
*  I think I think the whole thing is how you go bankrupt gradually, then suddenly. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1863.0s)]
*  And at some point, it's just past the sell by date and it's over. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1867.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's somehow I don't know the 20th century lasted. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1874.0s)]
*  It was it went on in this zombie way for like another 20 years, the 2000s and 2010s. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1879.0s)]
*  And somehow, you know, the 20th century is actually over. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1885.0s)]
*  And and this sort of New Deal liberalism, political correct leftism, this whole consolation of, you know, the progressive cult that is the university. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1889.0s)]
*  You know, these things have have finally unraveled. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1902.0s)]
*  And there are there are people like me who are in some ways oppositional to this or fighting this for a long time. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1906.0s)]
*  And and and it's it's it's often felt like, man, this stuff never changes. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1914.0s)]
*  I started I started the Teal Fellowship to encourage kids to drop out of college in 2010. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1921.0s)]
*  I remember 2019 nine years later, I was at this event at MIT and the university president was talking. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1926.0s)]
*  It was all these bromides. It was like it was 2005. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1932.0s)]
*  And some men were never going to make progress. These institutions, you know, they're unreformable, but they don't need to reform. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1935.0s)]
*  And and five years later, you know, the collapse has been has been pretty big. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1942.0s)]
*  And it's it's it's hard. I don't see how it recovers. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1947.0s)]
*  You know, they will they will figure something out. But it's not obvious how they will. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1951.0s)]
*  I mean, something I've been thinking about a lot since Tuesday night is like, does Peter Teal feel vindicated in this moment? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1956.0s)]
*  I I. Sure, sure. But you know, I think that an embarrassing thing to answer. Yes, too. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1971.0s)]
*  Well, it's it's you. You must feel vindicated. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1985.0s)]
*  I mean, here's here's how I was thinking about it. Like in 2016, you were the boogeyman. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1989.0s)]
*  OK, I'm sure you were called that in a million articles, but that's what it was. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=1995.0s)]
*  And you were sort of alone as the maybe the way I think about you is like the vanguard of the counter elite. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2000.0s)]
*  You were you made history. You were at the RNC with the first gay man to ever speak at the RNC. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2007.0s)]
*  And it didn't lead to a cascade of other people, let's say, standing with you. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2012.0s)]
*  And this election, you have Bill Ackman, Mark Andreessen, Elon Musk. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2017.0s)]
*  I want to talk in a little bit about what created that shift. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2023.0s)]
*  But you were ahead, arguably, by eight years. There's no in my view. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2026.0s)]
*  There's no way you couldn't feel vindicated. Yeah, I think I think the well, I think the fantasy I had in 2016 was something like there were there were all these deep substantive problems that I think existed. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2030.0s)]
*  I think our society, our society is too stagnant. We're not making enough progress. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2046.0s)]
*  There's a way the intergenerational compact has broken down. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2051.0s)]
*  The younger generations finding it much harder to get their footing. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2054.0s)]
*  And and yeah, there's sort of all these ways that our society is no longer progressing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2058.0s)]
*  The economy is not doing as well. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2065.0s)]
*  All sorts of different variations of this problem of stagnation or even outright decline that I had been talking about for a while. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2067.0s)]
*  And and I think my fantasy in 2016 was that Trump was a way for us to force a conversation about the stagnation, you know, make America great again was the most pessimistic slogan that any presidential candidates, certainly any Republican candidate had had in a hundred years. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2075.0s)]
*  Because it was maybe you're going to make it great again, but you're going to start by saying we are no longer a great country. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2100.0s)]
*  I felt it was a political it was this powerful political way of articulating this problem stagnation. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2107.0s)]
*  You know, what do you do about it? Hard to say. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2114.0s)]
*  First step is you talk about it first. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2116.0s)]
*  How do we make our country great? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2118.0s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2120.0s)]
*  But probably first step is not as great as we think we are. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2121.0s)]
*  And then maybe we can become great again if we sort of level set and admit where we are. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2125.0s)]
*  And and so that was sort of my fantasy. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2130.0s)]
*  And then I don't think I don't think the country was remotely ready for this and certainly not the Democratic part of the country. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2134.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're I don't know if the Democrats are ready for it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2141.0s)]
*  I think the country as a whole is. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2145.0s)]
*  And and and so there you know, there is there is sort of some admission that man, there was a lot of stuff that Trump was right about. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2147.0s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff where things sure feel like they're on the wrong track. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2154.0s)]
*  And and I think that's where we are in a very, very different place. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2159.0s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the shift that happened in Silicon Valley. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2165.0s)]
*  OK, because I think what happened is what's called a preference cascade. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2169.0s)]
*  You probably know that term better than me. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2173.0s)]
*  But it's essentially when when several people, maybe a group of people around the same time, realize they're not the only one. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2175.0s)]
*  And in fact, you know, maybe they represent, if not a majority, a powerful minority. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2183.0s)]
*  And I remember I remember it very clearly because it was the day our son was born. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2189.0s)]
*  Our son was born. And a few hours later, Trump got shot at in Butler. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2194.0s)]
*  And I watched as people who had sort of all of the aesthetics had been indicating to me that they were Trump supporters. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2199.0s)]
*  But all of a sudden, with the picture of Trump and all of them retweeting it, it became, oh, my God, like abundantly clear as one after the other sort of started to basically endorse him with this picture. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2206.0s)]
*  Yes. Explain that phenomenon to me, because like me, I'm sure you know, lots of people who have sort of like once politics on Signal or WhatsApp. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2217.0s)]
*  And another politics in public. And I felt like over the course of basically from July to the election, the gap between those things sort of radically narrowed. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2228.0s)]
*  What happened? Yes. It's probably something like what you described. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2238.0s)]
*  It's there was some degree to which it was safer for people to speak out when other people were speaking out. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2245.0s)]
*  You know, once once you know you're lying and you know that everybody's lying and you know that everybody knows that everybody knows that everybody's lying. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2253.0s)]
*  You know, at some point it becomes pretty unstable and it can just all of a sudden, you know, shift pretty fast into was on the critical ingredient. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2263.0s)]
*  Did he give people cover? I think Elon was incredibly important to it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2273.0s)]
*  I think there was a there were a lot of pieces that had that had built built up in in Silicon Valley. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2282.0s)]
*  There was a you know, there's always there's always a way where for many years people had been doubling down on the wokeness, the political correctness inside these companies. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2289.0s)]
*  And and and then it's always an ambiguous thing. If something is not working, let's say wokeness isn't really working. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2302.0s)]
*  It's not making your employees happier and more productive and more constructive. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2311.0s)]
*  And it's instead deranging it. But the ambiguity is, does that mean you need to have more wokeness or do you need to cut it out altogether? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2316.0s)]
*  And for you know, for a number of years, the intuition was, well, we just have to do a little bit more. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2325.0s)]
*  We have to try a little bit harder and do a little bit more. And then, you know, there's there's some point where it just got exhausted. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2332.0s)]
*  And and certainly, certainly a lot of the the the top tech founders and CEOs felt comfortable telling me this behind closed doors. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2340.0s)]
*  Maybe they're just telling me things that I want to hear. But I tend to think they're telling me what they really think. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2352.0s)]
*  And and so I was yeah, was very aware of this incredible disconnect. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2357.0s)]
*  It was in Silicon Valley. I think a lot of it was experienced as corporate governance, as you know, how ridiculous it's gotten to manage these ideologically deranged millennial employees. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2361.0s)]
*  And, you know, you know, I want I'll try not to name names, but, you know, one of the bigger companies that was in San Francisco, you know, people in 2017, the founders told me it was, you know, they weren't sure they could take any more money from me. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2376.0s)]
*  Because I supported Trump and it was sort of difficult to explain to their employees. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2391.0s)]
*  But it was about a 12 month period by by 2019. You know, they hadn't shifted to being pro Trump, but it was they really appreciated my courage. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2395.0s)]
*  And they they they organized their company where, you know, they had the hiring goals were to shift employees away from San Francisco Bay Area as fast as possible. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2403.0s)]
*  So we are we have X percent of people working in San Francisco and we want to reduce that percentage as quickly as possible for a company as big as we are. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2414.0s)]
*  And and that was and then, you know, if we if we build our employee workforce in any place other than San Francisco, it'll be less woke and less crazy and more productive. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2425.0s)]
*  And so this was the kind of just very prosaic conversation had about, you know, how to how to manage a company. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2437.0s)]
*  And then and then at some point at some point we got the preference cascade that was was twenty twenty four. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2444.0s)]
*  But yeah, obviously, Elon gave gave people a great deal of cover. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2451.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, it certainly it certainly seemed incredibly dangerous to me what he did, incredibly courageous. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2457.0s)]
*  You know, what would have happened to him if if if Trump would have lost. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2465.0s)]
*  And then and then and then certainly it it was well, you know, maybe all all the rest of us can be a little bit more courageous than we otherwise were going to be. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2470.0s)]
*  But he gave cover to everybody. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2480.0s)]
*  One of the things that was being said on both sides before the election by Oprah and Elon, and they sounded different saying it, but it was the same message was that if their candidate didn't win, this was going to be the last American election. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2482.0s)]
*  I thought that was totally nuts, but maybe you don't. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2499.0s)]
*  Or maybe you hear it differently. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2505.0s)]
*  Let me I I didn't want to believe Elon when he said this. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2507.0s)]
*  And I, you know, I I texted him a few weeks before the election and told him, you know, I hadn't believed you when you said this at first. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2515.0s)]
*  But it's but I think it's because psychologically, I don't want to believe that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2522.0s)]
*  I don't want to believe that the country's so far gone. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2526.0s)]
*  That you have to leave the country or something. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2530.0s)]
*  And but then it was the sense in which I felt that he was he was correct was that if if Trump with what I think but much better substance, much better on so many things could not win in 2024 against the machine. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2533.0s)]
*  If if Trump with what I think but much better substance, much better on so many things could not win in 2024 against the machine. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2545.0s)]
*  The machine would always win and the machine always wins. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2561.0s)]
*  You no longer have a democracy. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2564.0s)]
*  You know, you certainly no longer have a democratic process within the Democratic Party. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2566.0s)]
*  You know, we always debate the election shenanigans in November of 2020. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2570.0s)]
*  The far more extraordinary thing was March of 2020, where Biden comes in fourth place, fifth place in Iowa, New Hampshire, and then somehow gets rammed through South Carolina. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2574.0s)]
*  All the other candidates drop off. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2584.0s)]
*  So the extremely non-democratic primary in the Democratic Party in 2020 and then an even less democratic process by which Biden was replaced with Harris. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2586.0s)]
*  And and yeah, it was going to be this. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2597.0s)]
*  And if the machine could could defeat Trump, I thought it was reasonable that it would gain even more power and somehow be unbeatable. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2600.0s)]
*  And, you know, the country would be would become California, become a one party state. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2611.0s)]
*  We far worse than California because the constraint on California's people can leave California. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2617.0s)]
*  It's much harder to leave the US. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2622.0s)]
*  Say the machine. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2624.0s)]
*  Explain what you mean by that. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2625.0s)]
*  It's well, it's it's it's it's sort of a question of what it what is actually going on in the Democratic Party or in this progressive cult that is the left. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2627.0s)]
*  And maybe a cult is is too kind a word because, you know, a cult normally has a cult leader. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2644.0s)]
*  It's one person who's thinking inside a cult, the cult leader. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2649.0s)]
*  And it is again, it's a machine because there are no individuals. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2653.0s)]
*  And it's like, you know, it's like you are just a small cog in the machine and you're destined to become an ever smaller cog in this ever bigger machine. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2659.0s)]
*  And that's that's kind of that's kind of the vibe of it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2669.0s)]
*  And and it doesn't you know, ideas don't matter. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2673.0s)]
*  Debates don't matter. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2678.0s)]
*  You know, speech doesn't matter. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2680.0s)]
*  It's it's it's it's it's just some kind of fast consensus formation process. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2682.0s)]
*  We we get to an answer and then and then we we rigorously enforce it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2689.0s)]
*  You know, it's it's always too extreme to describe like the Communist Party or something like this, but it is it's just this extremely regimented process that's, you know, somehow not very Democratic, not very thoughtful, not very Republican, not very American. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2695.0s)]
*  OK. One of the things that interested me about your role in this election cycle is, you know, when you look back at 2016, you were all in. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2713.0s)]
*  All in. Right. You gave, you know, tens of millions of dollars between Trump and then I think 16 Republican candidates, including Senator now VP elect J.D. Vance, who will get to. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2723.0s)]
*  But you sat this presidential election cycle out and you were at the Aspen Ideas Festival, not a place that I expect to see you. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2735.0s)]
*  And you said this, if you hold a gun to my head, I'll vote for Trump, but I'm not going to give any money to his super PAC. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2742.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2749.0s)]
*  The Aspen Ideas Festival, it's a 75 percent liberal audience. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2751.0s)]
*  So even in front of it's way big, way more than 75 percent. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2755.0s)]
*  I will say when I showed up there, I was like the most right wing person. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2759.0s)]
*  If you take me literally, Barry, I'll just make this point. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2762.0s)]
*  And you held a gun to my head in front of a liberal audience. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2767.0s)]
*  And I would say I'm still voting for Trump, even if you hold a gun to my head in front of this very liberal audience. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2770.0s)]
*  You better believe that I'm very, very pro Trump. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2775.0s)]
*  I also said that I, you know, I I didn't think the money would make that much of a difference. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2778.0s)]
*  And it turned out really not to write. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2785.0s)]
*  It was it was it was, you know, Trump was insanely outspent and it it didn't matter. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2789.0s)]
*  And but, yeah, I I think what I mean is like you're all in in 2016 and then it feels like you sort of retreated. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2796.0s)]
*  Other people stepped into the breach, but you retreated. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2805.0s)]
*  And if I see a pattern to your life and the bets you make, you're often very early and very ahead. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2808.0s)]
*  And so I guess I wonder what that pulling back indicates. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2815.0s)]
*  I I don't know. I I I articulated in various contexts why I thought Trump is going to win, why he should win. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2820.0s)]
*  You know, what I went on to discuss at the at the Asmodeus Festival. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2830.0s)]
*  The probably the thing I said that was the most scandalous was just descriptively he's going to win. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2834.0s)]
*  He's going to win by a big margin because for that audience, you know, it's always Hegelian. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2839.0s)]
*  The actual is the ideal. And so his you know, and so if you say that Trump's going to win, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2844.0s)]
*  that's the way of saying Trump should win and he deserves to win. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2851.0s)]
*  And that was the and so the most scandalous thing I could have told those people was not I'm going to work really hard for Trump. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2856.0s)]
*  And I may or may not succeed. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2863.0s)]
*  The most scandalous thing I could tell them was, you know, Trump is on the winning side of history. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2865.0s)]
*  He's going to crush it whether I help him or not. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2870.0s)]
*  So that was the most shocking thing. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2872.0s)]
*  And there were like audible gasps when I said that to that audience. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2874.0s)]
*  You said in one interview in twenty twenty three that the Trump administration was crazier and more dangerous than you expected. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2878.0s)]
*  What do you mean by that? It felt very unstable. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2885.0s)]
*  It felt it felt dangerous for the people who got got involved. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2889.0s)]
*  You know, there were there were all sorts of people got prosecuted. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2893.0s)]
*  People went to jail. You know, they probably did things that were wrong. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2897.0s)]
*  They were also subject to crazy double standards. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2903.0s)]
*  And and so, yeah, there were sort of there were aspects of it that felt like, you know, a circular firing squad where, you know, it was I know this. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2907.0s)]
*  You know, and so, yeah, there were all sorts of things where it felt like there was a lot of uncompensated volatility for the people that that that got that got involved at the time. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2919.0s)]
*  I. I still I still have some worries that I'm I'm certainly will be much improved this time. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2933.0s)]
*  I still worry it will not be improved by enough or a different way of formulating it would be that one of the paradoxes of our elections is the elections are always relativistic exercises. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2943.0s)]
*  It's basically two candidates. Which one do you like more? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2955.0s)]
*  Which one do you hate less? It's more and more negative. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2959.0s)]
*  Which one do you hate less? And and and then once the election's over, we have just one president. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2961.0s)]
*  And then that person gets put on this pedestal and they are always found to fall way short of that standard. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2970.0s)]
*  So elections are relativistic after the elections. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2977.0s)]
*  It's it's absolute. And so I I have I have a worry in the back of my head that there are elements of that that will repeat that, you know, on a relative basis, Trump was. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=2981.0s)]

*  Is he good enough to stop us from Armageddon? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3047.0s)]
*  I hope so. Not 100% sure that he's good enough. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3049.0s)]
*  One of the, I think, very proper fears of those that oppose Trump was the fact that in the first administration, he had a lot of people around him who, perhaps some on the right would view them as swamp creatures, but perhaps other people, me included, would view them as public servants that were trying to keep this thing on the rails. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3051.0s)]
*  who, perhaps some on the right would view them as swamp creatures, but perhaps other people, me included, would view them as public servants that were trying to, sort of keep this thing on the rails. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3063.0s)]
*  who, perhaps some on the right would view them as swamp creatures, but perhaps other people, me included, would view them as public servants that were trying to, sort of, keep this thing on the rails, many of whom were burned, or fired on Twitter, or suffered, as you said, reputational damage, and the idea is that he's burned through the A-list, the B-list, the C-list, and who's left. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3069.0s)]
*  He had a lot of people around him that I thought about aswoan, but even in his words he seems owns me. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3078.0s)]
*  Do you share that fear? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3087.0s)]
*  Do you think that that's well founded? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3089.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3095.32s)]
*  Really, okay. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3096.52s)]
*  I don't know, I think they'll have [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3097.36s)]
*  a much stronger bench this time. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3101.6s)]
*  I think a lot of the, I don't know, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3104.28s)]
*  sort of, let's say establishmentarian, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3108.32s)]
*  swamp creature people they ended up with, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3111.28s)]
*  were not that good. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3114.88s)]
*  I don't know, I don't wanna pick on too many individually, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3117.4s)]
*  but someone like General Mattis at Defense, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3120.24s)]
*  as the Defense Secretary, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3123.2s)]
*  how bad your people skills have to be [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3127.94s)]
*  that you fall for the Elizabeth Holmes Theranos fraud [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3130.92s)]
*  and you're on the board of her company? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3134.6s)]
*  Well, George Shultz fell for that too, to be fair. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3138.04s)]
*  I don't think you consider him a- [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3140.48s)]
*  He was a lot older. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3141.96s)]
*  I expect a general, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3144.52s)]
*  in the probably ways they're too regimented, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3148.0s)]
*  I expect them to have good skills at judging people [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3149.84s)]
*  and leading people, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3153.52s)]
*  and there aren't that many frauds in Silicon Valley [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3155.04s)]
*  that you fall for the biggest one in the last decade. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3158.48s)]
*  Maybe FTX- [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3165.08s)]
*  I just don't know if that's the fair litmus. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3165.92s)]
*  I mean, Rupert Murdoch fell for it too. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3167.56s)]
*  He invested in it, he was not on the board. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3169.64s)]
*  But I think there were all these ways. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3173.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think these people were that good, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3179.92s)]
*  and they were not good at rethinking [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3184.32s)]
*  some of the priorities. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3189.92s)]
*  There are ways that Trump does not have [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3195.7200000000003s)]
*  a overarching ideological agenda. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3199.96s)]
*  It's not Reaganite, it's not a programmatic agenda, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3203.76s)]
*  but it is sort of a, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3207.76s)]
*  there is a direction that the neocon interventionism [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3211.6400000000003s)]
*  went wrong. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3219.04s)]
*  It needs to be, we need to rethink the failures, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3220.1200000000003s)]
*  especially the Bush Republican era. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3224.84s)]
*  There's a sense that the globalization project [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3228.4s)]
*  has gone very haywire. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3233.44s)]
*  Again, it's not clear what you do instead, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3234.84s)]
*  and there's a part of globalization in theory [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3238.7200000000003s)]
*  was a good thing, a borderless world, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3241.04s)]
*  a world in which there are no boundaries to trade, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3243.64s)]
*  the movement of goods, immigration, the movement of people, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3246.2000000000003s)]
*  capital, the movement of finance and the power of banks, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3250.44s)]
*  and ideas, free flow of information, the internet. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3255.52s)]
*  So this was globalization in theory, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3258.72s)]
*  and then in practice, so much of it somehow got hijacked [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3261.68s)]
*  by corrupt actors, actors that are adversarial to the US. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3266.6s)]
*  The WTO is a free trade organization that by 2001 [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3271.7599999999998s)]
*  was hijacked by communist China. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3276.64s)]
*  And then there was some way [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3280.28s)]
*  the stuff needed to be rethought. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3282.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think had a great ideology on this, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3284.6s)]
*  but directionally, I believe he was correct [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3288.68s)]
*  that we needed to somehow rethink these things. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3291.16s)]
*  And the place where the swamp preachers [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3293.16s)]
*  were very unhelpful is they didn't want to rethink things. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3296.48s)]
*  And I do think this is where [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3301.88s)]
*  the second Trump administration will be in a different place. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3303.48s)]
*  But Trump's almost 80 years old. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3307.7599999999998s)]
*  He's not gonna change his character and who he is. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3308.96s)]
*  And if you're someone, let's say, who has a great life, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3311.44s)]
*  maybe you're in Silicon Valley, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3314.96s)]
*  maybe you're looking and thinking, wait, wow, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3318.16s)]
*  maybe I could make a big difference in this administration, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3320.08s)]
*  and you just see the way that he churns through people, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3323.12s)]
*  what's gonna make you overcome this theoretical person [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3327.04s)]
*  to decide to kind of move to Washington, DC [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3331.28s)]
*  and give it a shot? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3335.32s)]
*  Like, I just don't see that aspect of it changing. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3338.16s)]
*  You know, I don't think Trump is going to change [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3340.64s)]
*  his views that strongly, but again, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3347.4s)]
*  I don't think he's that pro... [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3349.4s)]
*  I mean his character, not his views, his character. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3351.16s)]
*  But I think he was right to fire. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3354.56s)]
*  They were wrong to hire a lot of the people they hired. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3357.36s)]
*  They were right to fire a lot of them [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3360.88s)]
*  because they were not aligned, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3362.96s)]
*  they were not remotely aligned with the administration. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3364.56s)]
*  You know, there's some way to do it [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3367.36s)]
*  and there's some way not to do it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3369.56s)]
*  It was, I don't wanna pick on too many individuals. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3370.84s)]
*  Bolton, as national security advisor, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3373.92s)]
*  he was picked because he agreed with Trump on one thing, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3376.56s)]
*  which was that Iran was a problem. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3380.12s)]
*  And he disagreed with Trump on everything else. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3382.2799999999997s)]
*  And... [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3384.92s)]
*  China? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3386.2799999999997s)]
*  I think Bolton didn't have a terribly well-formed [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3388.44s)]
*  set of views on China. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3394.84s)]
*  And... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3396.88s)]
*  And it was not a priority. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3399.0s)]
*  So he probably disagreed with it as a priority, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3400.84s)]
*  if nothing else. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3402.88s)]
*  And then, yeah, maybe Trump should have known this [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3404.2400000000002s)]
*  and should not have hired Bolton. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3407.32s)]
*  Or Bolton should have been aware of it [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3409.76s)]
*  and should have been able to figure out a way to, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3411.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, to work, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3415.8s)]
*  you know, within, you know, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3418.76s)]
*  the rough direction that had been set by Trump. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3420.8s)]
*  And it just blew up. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3423.88s)]
*  So, yeah, my hope is there will be way fewer firings [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3425.88s)]
*  and they'll do a better job the first time around. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3431.28s)]
*  In 2016, you had a hand in suggesting candidates [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3434.44s)]
*  for Trump's administration. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3439.56s)]
*  Vanity Fair, which I'm sure you don't read, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3440.76s)]
*  called you the shadow president. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3442.88s)]
*  Who's in that role this time? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3445.48s)]
*  Some people, you know, see Elon Musk camped out at Mar-a-Lago [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3446.6800000000003s)]
*  and saying it's him. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3449.36s)]
*  Other people are watching as, you know, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3450.36s)]
*  potential appointees like Bridge Colby [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3452.4s)]
*  are making their way to pilgrimage [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3456.16s)]
*  in Tucker Carlson's house in Maine. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3457.24s)]
*  Is it him that's calling the shots? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3459.84s)]
*  Who are the people that are most influential [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3461.84s)]
*  in Trump's year right now? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3463.88s)]
*  I think Trump is calling the shots. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3465.56s)]
*  I think President Trump is calling the shots. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3467.4s)]
*  He's probably thought about it a lot more than he did [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3469.16s)]
*  when he came in in 2016. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3474.36s)]
*  I'm not sure he'll get everything right, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3476.88s)]
*  but I think he is going to be much more focused [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3478.88s)]
*  on bringing in people that are, you know, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3483.28s)]
*  roughly in sync with the program. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3487.0400000000004s)]
*  And I'm hopeful it'll be often a much better start. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3489.1600000000003s)]
*  But I think, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3492.36s)]
*  the buck stops with Trump. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3494.6000000000004s)]
*  And this is a way where it is very different from Biden [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3496.4s)]
*  or whatever the last four years we just had were. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3499.44s)]
*  Okay, I want to talk about some of Trump's policies. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3503.8s)]
*  He campaigned on a few policies [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3506.6400000000003s)]
*  that seem very inconceivable to me. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3508.84s)]
*  One of them is this 20% tariff on all goods [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3512.4s)]
*  from other countries and a 60% tariff on goods from China. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  Should we take him, you know, seriously, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3518.7200000000003s)]
*  but not literally there? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3520.44s)]
*  Is that going to happen? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3521.6400000000003s)]
*  And if so, what does that look like? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3522.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know, Barry, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3526.52s)]
*  there's so many levels one can go through this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3530.92s)]
*  There are- [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3533.84s)]
*  Well, then maybe let's start with this. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3534.6800000000003s)]
*  Are those tariffs a good idea, in your view? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3536.2400000000002s)]
*  They are, I think directionally, they are a good idea. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3539.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3544.44s)]
*  In practice, you probably want to be more nuanced [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3545.28s)]
*  in, you know, there's some things you want to tariff, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3550.2000000000003s)]
*  some things you want to be more careful about. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3552.4s)]
*  But, you know, there's a way free trade theory [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3556.6s)]
*  from the classical economics, the 19th century works, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3559.88s)]
*  and it's countries trade with each other, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3562.8s)]
*  but it assumes, what it assumed was that you had [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3565.52s)]
*  comparable labor standards, comparable regulations, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3569.8s)]
*  you had free flow of capital, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3574.4s)]
*  so if you make money, you can invest it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  And then the free trade theory, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3578.76s)]
*  it implied that things would be near equilibrium, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3582.8s)]
*  that you wouldn't have countries [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3585.96s)]
*  with chronic trade surpluses or chronic trade deficits. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3588.16s)]
*  If you have a chronic trade deficit, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3592.4s)]
*  as the United States has, it tells you, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3595.28s)]
*  I think that there's, you know, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3600.36s)]
*  something incredibly off in the dynamics. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3601.84s)]
*  There's a political way to think about this too, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3607.84s)]
*  which is, and I'll use free trade and scare quotes. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3610.44s)]
*  There is a way that free trade, as it currently operates, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3615.48s)]
*  benefits certain parts of the US and hurts other parts. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3619.52s)]
*  We have a very strong dollar. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3623.28s)]
*  In some ways it helps Silicon Valley, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3626.0s)]
*  in some ways it helps Wall Street and the financial system [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3628.08s)]
*  because the trade deficit, the current account deficit, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3633.68s)]
*  gets recycled into the US. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3637.08s)]
*  So if you have a multi-hundred billion dollar [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3639.08s)]
*  trade deficit and China ends up [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3643.4s)]
*  with hundreds of billions of dollars [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3645.12s)]
*  that it doesn't want to spend on US goods or services, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3647.44s)]
*  it's only choice at the end of the day [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3650.16s)]
*  is to invest that money in the US. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3651.44s)]
*  The money gets invested through the banking system [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3653.8s)]
*  and the banks make money. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3657.6s)]
*  So in a way you can think of the Wall Street banks [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3658.92s)]
*  are long the trade deficit. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3660.96s)]
*  The bigger the deficit, the more money they make. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3663.4s)]
*  When the deficits go down, the banks blow up. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3665.32s)]
*  And something similar happened between 2006 and 2009. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3668.48s)]
*  2006 we had an 800 billion dollar current account deficit [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3671.56s)]
*  and basically you had to have 800 billion dollars [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3675.44s)]
*  of fake financial products that Wall Street had to sell [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3678.04s)]
*  where it's like a triple A rated subprime mortgage bond [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3680.64s)]
*  that some clueless bank in Denmark buys up from the US [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3684.2400000000002s)]
*  and at some point, okay we don't really wanna buy [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3689.2400000000002s)]
*  these bonds and maybe we don't wanna sell goods to the US [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3691.32s)]
*  because there's nothing we can do with the dollars. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3695.04s)]
*  The trade deficit, current account deficit collapsed [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3696.96s)]
*  and then we had the 2008 global financial crisis [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3699.48s)]
*  which again was at the time centered on the US banks. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3702.8s)]
*  So there's sort of a way, maybe these deficits are good [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3707.0800000000004s)]
*  but the sectoral effect in the US is that it really helps [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3710.92s)]
*  certain parts of the US economy at the expense of others. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3715.0800000000004s)]
*  One of the sectors that's hurt the most [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3722.96s)]
*  are these swing states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3724.88s)]
*  Wisconsin where they were in the business of manufacturing, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3728.88s)]
*  of building goods that in some sense had to be competitive [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3735.0s)]
*  in this global market and politically, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3739.32s)]
*  one way to analyze the elections in 2016 was that Trump, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3747.04s)]
*  in 2016 said we're gonna do something about [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3752.1200000000003s)]
*  this rust belt problem in the Midwest [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3754.96s)]
*  and they failed to do much in the next four years [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3758.16s)]
*  and then those states reverted to the Democrats [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3761.3199999999997s)]
*  and then four years later, in a way the Biden people [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3764.8799999999997s)]
*  did even less and so Trump's been given another chance [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3768.3199999999997s)]
*  to do something. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3771.3599999999997s)]
*  So there's sort of a political economy way of thinking [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3772.2s)]
*  of the trade deficit where if you say what Trump needs to do [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3776.3999999999996s)]
*  or what JD Vance needs to do to get elected president in 2028 [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3781.08s)]
*  is to fix the rust belt problem in the Midwest [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3785.84s)]
*  and maybe the tariffs are bad in some aggregate sense [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3789.28s)]
*  but just for the Republicans to politically win, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3792.2000000000003s)]
*  you have to do something for those parts of the country. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3794.76s)]
*  But I think, look, I think the other theory on this [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3799.88s)]
*  is that there's a game theory to it as well [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3804.76s)]
*  where if you have counterparts that are engaged [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3808.1600000000003s)]
*  in extremely unfair trade, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3811.88s)]
*  maybe you have to threaten tariffs [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3814.84s)]
*  as a way to get them to open up. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3816.56s)]
*  If you're always saying we're never gonna do anything, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3818.68s)]
*  you will end up with a very subpar kind of a free trade [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3822.84s)]
*  world and so this is where even if in theory [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3827.04s)]
*  we believe in free trade, I never want free trade treaties [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3829.56s)]
*  negotiated by people who are ideological free traders [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3832.7599999999998s)]
*  because they will always think they don't need [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3836.12s)]
*  to negotiate anything and then there's so many other points [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3838.56s)]
*  Let me make one last point on this is if you did 60% [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3841.8799999999997s)]
*  across the board tariffs on China, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3848.3999999999996s)]
*  it probably would be very, very bad [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3853.2799999999997s)]
*  for Chinese companies and China. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3859.0s)]
*  It would only be mildly bad for US consumers [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3863.0s)]
*  because an awful lot of stuff would get shifted away [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3867.4399999999996s)]
*  from China and because trade is not, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3870.36s)]
*  we always model it as between two countries. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3873.1600000000003s)]
*  Well the thing people say to scare people is, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3875.44s)]
*  do you wanna be, yeah, sorry. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3877.96s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of stuff [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3880.6s)]
*  that doesn't get shifted back to the US. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3881.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't believe that's what happens. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3883.48s)]
*  So the iPhone, you can't bill those economically in the US [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3884.76s)]
*  so it doesn't get shifted from China to the US. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3888.7200000000003s)]
*  If you put 60% tariffs on iPhones [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3891.1200000000003s)]
*  and it costs twice as much to make them in the US [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3894.76s)]
*  then they just cost more. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3897.6800000000003s)]
*  But what I think will happen is you shift the iPhones [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3899.2s)]
*  to Vietnam or India or places like that [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3902.96s)]
*  and maybe our trade deficit doesn't go down [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3906.92s)]
*  but we at least aren't helping our geopolitical rival. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3910.8799999999997s)]
*  Vietnam is an evil communist country [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3915.12s)]
*  but it's not bent on world domination. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3918.08s)]
*  So if you shift manufacturing from China to Vietnam, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3921.3199999999997s)]
*  that hurts China. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3926.4s)]
*  It is maybe mildly negative for American consumers. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3928.0s)]
*  It's really good for Vietnam [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3932.8s)]
*  but in this geopolitical calculus [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3934.56s)]
*  that seems very much in the American interest. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3936.7200000000003s)]
*  Trump has promised not just to close the border [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3940.44s)]
*  which I think everyone can now acknowledge [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3943.7200000000003s)]
*  after the election has become extremely chaotic [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3946.4s)]
*  and dangerous but he's promised to deport [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3949.0s)]
*  something like 11 million people. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3951.84s)]
*  Do you think that's actually gonna happen? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3954.52s)]
*  I don't think they're literally going to do that [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3961.16s)]
*  and then at the same time, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3968.7599999999998s)]
*  there's some big way these things need to be rethought a lot [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3971.48s)]
*  and like trade, there's a theory [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3978.96s)]
*  of immigration where it somehow grows the GDP, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3984.92s)]
*  it's grown the economy and I always think [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3989.32s)]
*  one of the differences in immigration debates [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3994.44s)]
*  between Europe and the US is in Europe, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=3996.72s)]
*  immigration is mainly a cultural issue [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4000.16s)]
*  and you end up with a lot of immigrants [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4004.24s)]
*  who maybe don't share European cultural values [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4007.48s)]
*  and then Europe's societies are bad [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4011.4s)]
*  at culturally assimilating these people [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4014.0s)]
*  and there's sort of a set of cultural challenges [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4016.32s)]
*  with immigration. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4019.7200000000003s)]
*  I think the US is still pretty good [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4021.7200000000003s)]
*  at assimilating people culturally [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4025.08s)]
*  even with a lot of the ways our public schools [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4027.64s)]
*  and other institutions aren't working [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4029.88s)]
*  as well as they used to [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4031.6s)]
*  but I think the challenges with immigration [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4033.56s)]
*  are more of an economic nature in the US [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4036.28s)]
*  and that even though there are ways [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4040.0s)]
*  that immigrants can grow the pie, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4044.04s)]
*  it also has these effects of creating incredible skews, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4046.68s)]
*  incredible winner-loser dynamics in the US. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4053.88s)]
*  And I go through all these different variations of it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4060.4s)]
*  I myself am an immigrant, my parents, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4063.56s)]
*  I was born in Germany, we immigrated to the US [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4066.76s)]
*  in 1968, sort of the craziest year ever, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4069.12s)]
*  people thought my parents were out of their mind [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4074.2s)]
*  to leave Germany and come to the US, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4076.08s)]
*  the 1968 year the country was self-destructing [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4077.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm very fortunate they did [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4080.92s)]
*  and so I can't be sort of a categorical [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4084.56s)]
*  anti-immigrant person or at least it would be sort of weird [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4087.12s)]
*  pulling the ladder up behind me type of dynamic. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4092.04s)]
*  But at the same time, I think [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4094.92s)]
*  one should somehow be able to talk about all the ways [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4097.8s)]
*  that it creates these incredible economic skews [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4102.8s)]
*  and distortions and I'll just go down one particular vertical [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4106.56s)]
*  that I think is pretty important which is Henry George [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4111.8s)]
*  is this late 19th century economist [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4117.28s)]
*  who was considered quasi-socialist [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4120.56s)]
*  in the late 19th century, he's considered semi-libertarian [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4123.8s)]
*  in the early 21st century which maybe tells you something [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4126.5199999999995s)]
*  about how our society changed [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4128.799999999999s)]
*  but the basic Georgist obsession was real estate [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4131.0s)]
*  and it was if you weren't really careful, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4135.48s)]
*  you would get runaway real estate prices [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4138.0s)]
*  and the people who owned the real estate [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4141.2s)]
*  would make all the gains in a society [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4143.599999999999s)]
*  because there's something extremely inelastic [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4146.04s)]
*  about real estate and especially if you have [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4148.839999999999s)]
*  strict zoning laws or things like this, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4150.759999999999s)]
*  the dynamic ends up being that you add 10% [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4157.24s)]
*  to the population in a city [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4161.599999999999s)]
*  and maybe the house prices go up 50% [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  and maybe people's salaries go up [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4167.04s)]
*  but they don't go up by 50% [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4170.36s)]
*  and so the GDP grows but it's a giant windfall [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4172.48s)]
*  to the boomer homeowners and to the landlords [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4177.28s)]
*  and it's a massive hit to the lower middle class [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4180.839999999999s)]
*  and to young people who can never get on the housing ladder [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4185.36s)]
*  and there's sort of a way that I model [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4188.599999999999s)]
*  what's happened in the US, in Britain, Canada, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4192.36s)]
*  a lot of the Anglosphere countries [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4197.44s)]
*  is a Georgist real estate catastrophe [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4199.44s)]
*  where basically, there's sort of ways I can describe this [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4203.36s)]
*  in Los Angeles where we live, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4209.5599999999995s)]
*  all sorts of places where the real estate prices, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4212.6s)]
*  the rents have gone up more and more. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4216.92s)]
*  We talk about the inflation problem, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4219.08s)]
*  it was inflation and immigration [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4221.4800000000005s)]
*  but there's a way you could talk about inflation [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4223.400000000001s)]
*  in terms of the prices of eggs or groceries [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4226.96s)]
*  but that's not that big a cost item [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4231.64s)]
*  even for lower middle class people. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4234.52s)]
*  The really big cost item is the rent [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4237.08s)]
*  and I think in some ways, Trump and JD Vance [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4240.08s)]
*  did manage to shift the conversation a little bit [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4245.84s)]
*  to this real estate problem [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4249.32s)]
*  and again, I don't wanna blame it all on immigration [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4251.16s)]
*  but if you just add more people to the mix [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4253.5199999999995s)]
*  and you're not allowed to build new houses [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4259.08s)]
*  because of zoning laws or it's too expensive [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4261.84s)]
*  or it's too regulated and restricted, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4263.88s)]
*  then the prices go up a lot [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4266.04s)]
*  and it's this incredible wealth transfer [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4268.64s)]
*  from the young and the lower middle class [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4271.76s)]
*  to the upper middle class and the landlords and the old [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4275.240000000001s)]
*  and there are reasons you might not wanna do that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4278.8s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons you might not wanna do it [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4281.280000000001s)]
*  so that's sort of a very, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4282.6s)]
*  there's no invidious distinctions involved, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4285.360000000001s)]
*  this is just sort of a basic econ one point [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4287.84s)]
*  that we can't even make. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4291.04s)]
*  I think most Americans though, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4293.08s)]
*  when they're thinking about the border and immigration, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4294.68s)]
*  are thinking about particular stories [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4297.24s)]
*  that were I think rightly made a big deal in this campaign. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4300.639999999999s)]
*  They're thinking about criminals and drug cartels [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4304.92s)]
*  and sex trafficking and things like that. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4307.92s)]
*  They are not thinking, I don't think, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4309.92s)]
*  we should deport the Mexican grandmother [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  living in West Hollywood or whatever [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4317.679999999999s)]
*  and is that what we're gonna see? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4320.4s)]
*  Well, I would say that the incredibly open border [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4322.84s)]
*  has put an incredible stress on the social fabric [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4328.0s)]
*  in a lot of ways and yeah, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4334.08s)]
*  there's definitely the fentanyl crisis, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4336.72s)]
*  there are the narco drug gangs, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4338.8s)]
*  there are all these sort of crazy extreme stories [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4345.28s)]
*  that shouldn't happen at all [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4348.56s)]
*  and that tells you something's very off. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4350.0s)]
*  But then I think there's also a general version where, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4352.84s)]
*  I don't even know what the numbers are, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4358.36s)]
*  but you have a Los Angeles public high school system [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4359.56s)]
*  which you have to teach in 30 different languages [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4362.12s)]
*  or something like that and in which [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4364.72s)]
*  the public schools aren't working [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4368.88s)]
*  and then the amount people have to spend on rent [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4370.72s)]
*  in these places is so much higher than it was 30, 40, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4376.280000000001s)]
*  50 years ago as a percent of income [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4383.280000000001s)]
*  and that's a stress on immigrants, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4385.320000000001s)]
*  it's a stress on the people they're competing with directly. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4389.360000000001s)]
*  This is a sense in which if you say that the immigrants, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4393.320000000001s)]
*  let's say lower middle class Mexican immigrants [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4400.280000000001s)]
*  are competing with lower middle class Mexican people in LA [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4403.96s)]
*  then as an economic matter, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4408.76s)]
*  those are the people who should be the most anti it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4411.1s)]
*  If we go with identity politics, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4413.32s)]
*  they should say, well, we want more Mexicans [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4415.08s)]
*  but if you actually think of it in econ one terms, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4417.2s)]
*  maybe you don't want more people competing [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4422.08s)]
*  for your two bedroom apartment [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4424.06s)]
*  and driving up the rent even more [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4427.06s)]
*  or even more people crowding in [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4428.84s)]
*  and paying money to the landlord. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4431.12s)]
*  If you're a Bangladeshi Uber driver in New York City, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4435.84s)]
*  do you want a lot more Bangladeshis? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4440.16s)]
*  This is always the point I make about cloning [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4442.08s)]
*  where we can have all sorts of ethical debates [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4445.44s)]
*  about cloning but the econ one intuition [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4447.76s)]
*  is if we came along with 100 clones of Barry Weiss [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4450.84s)]
*  with competing talk shows, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4454.24s)]
*  you might say, well, I can't debate the ethics of this [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4456.62s)]
*  but we should be talking about the economics [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4461.5s)]
*  and you would be right saying, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4463.62s)]
*  I'm kind of nervous about the economics. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4465.74s)]
*  Ban cloning. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4467.18s)]
*  I'm just saying we should at least be able [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4469.74s)]
*  to talk about the economics. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4471.22s)]
*  Let's talk about education, an issue you care a lot about. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4472.58s)]
*  Trump has promised to get rid of the department of education [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4475.42s)]
*  saying it's unnecessary and effective [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4478.18s)]
*  and a tool of the world culture wars [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4479.94s)]
*  and he's also threatened to cut funding for higher education [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4481.9800000000005s)]
*  and I guess I wanna ask you a first principles question [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4485.5s)]
*  which is should taxpayer dollars go to support [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4488.42s)]
*  private universities like Harvard [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4492.820000000001s)]
*  and do you think that getting rid of [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4494.860000000001s)]
*  the department of education would be a good thing? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4496.58s)]
*  Yes, it would be a good thing. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4500.46s)]
*  I think you have to pick the battles of what you can do [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4501.7s)]
*  and where you can change things. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4506.22s)]
*  I think there are, I don't know, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4509.139999999999s)]
*  there are a lot of indirect ways you can shift things. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4513.0599999999995s)]
*  There is the NIH gives research grants. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4516.58s)]
*  A lot of those go to university scientists [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4521.099999999999s)]
*  and then there is a overhead budget [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4523.82s)]
*  which is typically something like 40%. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4526.5s)]
*  If you get a million dollar grant, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4529.339999999999s)]
*  maybe 40% of that or like 66% overcharge [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4530.86s)]
*  gets charged by the university in overhead. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4535.36s)]
*  I believe that number can be arbitrarily reset [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4539.58s)]
*  and you can reset that as a much, much lower number [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4541.94s)]
*  and it seems to me, and so a nuanced argument would be [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4545.5s)]
*  I want more money to go to the scientists [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4549.54s)]
*  and I want less money to go to the woke administration [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4551.82s)]
*  and diversity and what we know is this bloated [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4555.62s)]
*  diversity machine overhead [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4559.74s)]
*  and we won't defund the universities simply [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4562.34s)]
*  but we're gonna change the overhead expensing [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4567.3s)]
*  and I believe that number can be unilaterally [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4570.5s)]
*  zeroed out by executive order or changed by executive order. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4574.42s)]
*  I think the Department of Education [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4581.74s)]
*  is one of these weird departments [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4582.860000000001s)]
*  where very little can be done and very little changed [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4583.9400000000005s)]
*  but there are things like that that can be done [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4587.4400000000005s)]
*  that are quite dramatic. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4589.5s)]
*  There's obviously a student debt crisis [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4591.06s)]
*  that's completely out of control. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4594.42s)]
*  It was 300 billion in student debt in 2000. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4597.9400000000005s)]
*  It's now approaching $2 trillion [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4600.58s)]
*  and there's a way that it's crept up on people [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4606.38s)]
*  that is sort of subtle. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4609.34s)]
*  I was looking at this the other day. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4611.02s)]
*  So if you look at it by cohort, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4612.14s)]
*  if you graduated from college in 1997, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4614.18s)]
*  12 years later, 2009, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4618.58s)]
*  you'd paid off most of your student debt. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4623.22s)]
*  It took you a long time, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4625.46s)]
*  so probably the student debt meant [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4626.7s)]
*  you were slower to start a family, to buy a house. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4628.3s)]
*  It sort of probably in some ways [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4630.54s)]
*  had this deleterious effect on your career [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4632.74s)]
*  but there was some way that you took on all this debt [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4635.4400000000005s)]
*  and you could gradually get out of the hole [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4637.9400000000005s)]
*  and then gradually the debt grew faster [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4640.54s)]
*  than the value of the college degree grew economically [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4644.14s)]
*  and by 2009, the graduates of 2009 are the first cohort [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4647.72s)]
*  where the median student with debt in 2009, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4653.240000000001s)]
*  when you look at them 12 years later in 2021, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4656.92s)]
*  the debt's higher, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4660.4800000000005s)]
*  which means that you can't even keep up [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4662.740000000001s)]
*  with the interest payments on the student debt. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4665.12s)]
*  It's so big and the value of your college degree [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4667.8s)]
*  for the most part is so low. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4671.240000000001s)]
*  You got an English PhD, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4673.400000000001s)]
*  you end up as a barista at Starbucks or something like this [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4674.4400000000005s)]
*  and there are obviously some exceptions [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4677.92s)]
*  like computer science, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4679.68s)]
*  but most degrees had so little value, the debt was so big [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4681.04s)]
*  but then it takes 12 years to realize [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4685.4400000000005s)]
*  that it's not working like it used to [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4689.12s)]
*  because for a long time the colleges can just say, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4690.860000000001s)]
*  well, it eventually pays off, it takes a while [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4694.200000000001s)]
*  and maybe that's true but if it's no longer true, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4697.52s)]
*  man, are you in a deep hole by the time you realize it. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4701.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's something that's very off with it. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4703.400000000001s)]
*  I'm actually somewhat sympathetic to the Biden policy [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4709.0s)]
*  that maybe on some level you need to just forgive [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4716.44s)]
*  the student debt because people will never be able [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4720.08s)]
*  to pay it off and we need to have some realistic [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4722.04s)]
*  level setting. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4725.44s)]
*  I don't think that should be bailed out by the taxpayers [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4727.16s)]
*  and I think some of it should be, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4730.5199999999995s)]
*  some of it has to be hit to the bondholders of the debt [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4734.48s)]
*  and some of it has to be hit to the colleges [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4737.46s)]
*  and probably a lot of colleges, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4741.9800000000005s)]
*  if the colleges were even partially liable [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4743.82s)]
*  for all these unpaid debts, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4746.9800000000005s)]
*  most of them would be out of business [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4748.46s)]
*  and so there's something, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4750.58s)]
*  so there are a number of these things that, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4753.22s)]
*  they're coming to a head regardless. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4756.54s)]
*  I don't think Trump needs to particularly do anything. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4758.5s)]
*  Let me give you- [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4761.1s)]
*  Like it's gonna implode on itself. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4761.94s)]
*  It's an exponentially growing student debt problem. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4763.38s)]
*  It's an exponentially growing debt problem generally [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4767.66s)]
*  and we had for many years you could kick the can [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4770.7s)]
*  down the road but eventually end up with a pile of cans [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4775.58s)]
*  and no road and that's sort of where we are [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4778.38s)]
*  with the student debt thing or another. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4780.18s)]
*  I think this was a very strange 2024 election [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4782.62s)]
*  where there were all these big issues [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4785.66s)]
*  that I think were not being discussed. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4788.78s)]
*  So one other, this is what I speculate [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4791.46s)]
*  was one of the really big issues, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4795.94s)]
*  even bigger than just the student debt problem [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4799.1s)]
*  is maybe the bankruptcy of a number of blue states [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4801.14s)]
*  and blue cities, Illinois, Chicago, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4805.7s)]
*  probably the tri-state area, New York City, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4809.4s)]
*  maybe even San Francisco, maybe Los Angeles [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4812.96s)]
*  and what we did in 2020 was we used COVID [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4816.82s)]
*  as a cover to bail all these places out. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4823.099999999999s)]
*  Then 2021, they spent even more money [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4825.099999999999s)]
*  in this runaway Biden spending and part of it was [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4827.7s)]
*  a way to bail out all these failed blue cities [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4832.5s)]
*  and blue states and we should not be throwing [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4836.139999999999s)]
*  good money after bad and all that Trump, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4840.22s)]
*  Trump doesn't need to do something heroic [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4843.22s)]
*  like shutting down the Department of Education [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4845.22s)]
*  or getting Congress to reduce appropriations. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4847.58s)]
*  All he has to do for the blue cities [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4851.66s)]
*  and blue states to blow up is sit on his hands [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4854.7s)]
*  and do nothing. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4857.780000000001s)]
*  There was a 1970s history in the Ford administration [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4859.42s)]
*  where New York City almost went broke [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4862.7s)]
*  and Ford sat on his hands and it was the most popular thing. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4866.02s)]
*  Ford was down 30 points, came back to almost winning [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4870.22s)]
*  the reelection in 1976 and one of the main, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4874.14s)]
*  it was very popular not to bail out New York City [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4877.660000000001s)]
*  because people know we don't want to throw [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4881.42s)]
*  good money after bad and so I think there are, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4884.3s)]
*  this is sort of, if you look at the possibilities [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4891.42s)]
*  of changing the system, there's a way the inertia [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4894.740000000001s)]
*  seems so high that if we have to get rid [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4898.58s)]
*  of the Department of Education, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4900.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think that will ever happen [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4901.9400000000005s)]
*  and then I think the Democrats have nothing to worry about [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4903.38s)]
*  because Trump won't really do anything [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4906.06s)]
*  but if actually for the system to continue, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4908.34s)]
*  you need to get crazy new spending approved [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4911.42s)]
*  and all that Trump has to do is not approve [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4914.14s)]
*  the new spending, that's where I think you're gonna be able [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4916.46s)]
*  to force radical change, radical change in California, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4918.5s)]
*  in New York, in Illinois where these places [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4922.9400000000005s)]
*  have to reform themselves or go bankrupt. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4926.9800000000005s)]
*  I wanna talk a little bit about JD Vance [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4929.74s)]
*  whose name has come up a few times. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4931.3s)]
*  You gave $15 million to help him get elected [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4933.860000000001s)]
*  in the 2022 midterms, it might be the best $15 million [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4937.9400000000005s)]
*  arguably that you've ever spent but you'll tell me [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4941.38s)]
*  and I think you introduced Trump to JD Vance [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4943.860000000001s)]
*  in 2021 at Mar-a-Lago. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4946.3s)]
*  Now at this time, JD Vance was singing [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4948.18s)]
*  a very different tune, he had called Trump reprehensible, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4950.66s)]
*  he had talked about him as being America's Hitler. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4953.58s)]
*  Obviously, we've come a long way in those three years. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4956.38s)]
*  And I guess I wanna ask, what did you see in him [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4961.42s)]
*  that made you bet so big on him? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4963.42s)]
*  Well, I first met him in 2011 when I met a group of people [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4968.22s)]
*  at Yale Law School and did a small lunch [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4976.66s)]
*  with the Federal Society group there [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4978.78s)]
*  and he worked for one of my venture funds [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4980.54s)]
*  and we became friends over the years [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4984.58s)]
*  and he was, I don't know, just a very thoughtful person [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4987.9400000000005s)]
*  who thought very deeply about a lot of these issues [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4994.02s)]
*  and I'm probably, I don't know, I'm probably always [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=4999.06s)]
*  a sucker for smart, thoughtful people. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5002.740000000001s)]
*  But in 2011 when you meet a young JD Vance, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5005.3s)]
*  were you thinking future president of the United States? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5007.700000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I don't think, but no, I thought he was, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5010.14s)]
*  he made a great first impression and then, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5017.740000000001s)]
*  yeah, we sort of worked together for a number of years [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5021.9800000000005s)]
*  and I got to know him better over time. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5025.820000000001s)]
*  I do think there are probably all these different ways [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5031.580000000001s)]
*  that JD would do a better job articulating [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5036.580000000001s)]
*  his shift since 2016 and I think, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5039.580000000001s)]
*  I don't think he was saying things like that [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5045.58s)]
*  in 2018 or 2019, I think it was more sort of in the 2016 [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5047.74s)]
*  around the time when he wrote the Hillbilly Elegy book [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5053.82s)]
*  and he was sort of, in some ways became [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5056.98s)]
*  the way to explain Trump to liberals, liberal elites [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5066.22s)]
*  and there was sort of a part of that that I think felt [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5072.22s)]
*  very good to JD and then there was some part [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5081.46s)]
*  where at some point he felt like they weren't really [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5087.22s)]
*  interested in anything he had to say [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5090.9400000000005s)]
*  and maybe it was just sort of like a prop [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5093.34s)]
*  where if we bought his book, we understand, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5098.38s)]
*  we don't need to read it, we don't need to actually [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5104.02s)]
*  think about anything in it, but if we bought his book, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5105.54s)]
*  we've understood this as well as we need to [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5109.900000000001s)]
*  and so I think the personal version [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5114.34s)]
*  on the JD Vance story was on some level in 2016 [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5120.42s)]
*  he believed there was a way to convince liberals [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5128.22s)]
*  to figure out a way to solve some of these deep problems, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5132.42s)]
*  immigration, economics, the crisis of the Midwest [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5138.9800000000005s)]
*  and then at some point he thought they weren't really [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5144.78s)]
*  interested in solving them at all and that maybe [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5149.5s)]
*  Trump's somewhat more adversarial approach [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5153.1s)]
*  was actually more correct than he first thought. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5156.18s)]
*  One of the shifts that we're seeing inside [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5158.780000000001s)]
*  the Republican Party is not just on sort of [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5160.860000000001s)]
*  doctrinaire free trade, but is on foreign policy [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5164.3s)]
*  and there's a shift I would say from, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5169.14s)]
*  let's call it, I don't know what to call it, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5171.46s)]
*  like the neocon world view that typified the Bush years [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5172.780000000001s)]
*  to something that I don't think is quite isolationist [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5177.18s)]
*  but is different, right, you have someone like JD Vance [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5180.3s)]
*  saying I gotta be honest with you, I don't really care [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5182.9400000000005s)]
*  what happens to Ukraine and I wonder how you're making sense [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5186.26s)]
*  of that shift because at the All In Summit a few months ago [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5190.42s)]
*  and you referenced it already in this conversation [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5194.38s)]
*  you said we're sleepwalking into Armageddon [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5196.099999999999s)]
*  and from my perspective when I hear different versions [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5199.099999999999s)]
*  of America's trying to do too much, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5204.139999999999s)]
*  America should not be the world's policeman, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5207.139999999999s)]
*  America needs to kind of pull back from the world [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5209.0599999999995s)]
*  and if we're focused inward, my visceral reaction is [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5211.14s)]
*  well then someone's gonna fill that vacuum [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5215.22s)]
*  and it worries me and I don't think that makes me [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5217.820000000001s)]
*  some kind of neocon warmonger to be concerned about that [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5221.34s)]
*  and I worry that there's a kind of caricature [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5224.42s)]
*  of a debate happening right now where anyone [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5227.72s)]
*  that feels concerned about the decline of American power [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5230.34s)]
*  or defensive of American muscularity gets easily dunked on [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5234.860000000001s)]
*  because it's not the cool thing right now to say [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5239.66s)]
*  on the right and so I would love for you to make sense [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5243.22s)]
*  of where you think the right is shifting [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5246.0199999999995s)]
*  and how you think this administration [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5250.38s)]
*  is gonna conduct foreign policy. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5253.54s)]
*  Well I do think probably a lot of these things are [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5256.44s)]
*  more subtle and more nuanced and it's probably best [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5262.82s)]
*  to always talk about particular countries [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5268.7s)]
*  and particular situations. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5272.58s)]
*  I don't exactly know what you're supposed to do [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5275.46s)]
*  about the Ukraine right now. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5278.66s)]
*  I'm not sure that the Trump administration has a [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5280.82s)]
*  strongly set policy on that at all. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5285.219999999999s)]
*  There's definitely a historical thing where one can say [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5288.679999999999s)]
*  that the relentless NATO expansion [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5293.139999999999s)]
*  might not have been a good idea and there were ways that, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5296.64s)]
*  I don't know, we don't want the Russians to have troops [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5304.400000000001s)]
*  in Cuba or Mexico and maybe if NATO has troops in the Ukraine [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5306.320000000001s)]
*  should we have thought a little bit about how far we [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5313.400000000001s)]
*  how far we pushed that envelope and then at the same time [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5317.400000000001s)]
*  there's a part of it where we are where we are in 2024 [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5323.16s)]
*  and you probably can't simply retreat from the Ukraine [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5329.0s)]
*  without it just becoming a route and I don't think Trump, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5336.16s)]
*  President Trump wants a repeat of what happened [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5340.2s)]
*  with Biden in Afghanistan. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5342.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know, in the Middle East context I always think [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5346.08s)]
*  there's an isolationist approach, there is an idealistic [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5351.12s)]
*  almost utopian neo-con approach as was articulated by [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5357.0s)]
*  Bush 43 in a second inaugural address in 2005 which was, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5361.32s)]
*  I mean it was just going to transform the whole world [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5365.4s)]
*  in a way that was fantastical and just you could tell [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5368.48s)]
*  was not going to end the way it was advertised [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5375.44s)]
*  and then there's again sort of this in between messy [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5378.64s)]
*  dealing with the reality of the Middle East approach [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5381.76s)]
*  and I don't know, I don't think the US and Israel are [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5383.88s)]
*  perfectly in sync but I do think that if we simply deferred [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5391.96s)]
*  to Israel and on things related to the Middle East [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5399.12s)]
*  we'd have a far saner policy, we'd have a far more [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5404.200000000001s)]
*  realistic policy and the Israel, in a way the neo-cons [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5407.44s)]
*  were pro-Israel, the Israelis didn't trust the neo-cons [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5411.759999999999s)]
*  because Israel's a small country, it needs to be realistic [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5415.48s)]
*  and the neo-cons were these crazy idealists and so [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5419.08s)]
*  the Israeli view, it's complicated. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5422.879999999999s)]
*  You thought about this so much. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5426.08s)]
*  The way I would summarize the Israeli views, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5428.04s)]
*  what do you think about Syria? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5430.2s)]
*  They're no good rebels, everybody in Syria is bad, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5432.28s)]
*  we don't like Assad, we don't like the ISIS people, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5435.76s)]
*  maybe you can be somewhat involved, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5440.88s)]
*  you don't want to be that involved in Syria. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5442.12s)]
*  The Saudis, yeah it's a feudal monarchy, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5444.84s)]
*  it's better than the alternatives and the problem, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5448.0s)]
*  the one problem is Iran because if they get nuclear weapons [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5454.360000000001s)]
*  it changes the playing field in the whole region [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5459.88s)]
*  and so when I first met Netanyahu in January 2009, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5462.8s)]
*  one month before he came back as Prime Minister, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5466.92s)]
*  the only thing he wanted to talk about was Iran [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5469.56s)]
*  and that's the sense in which I think the Trump [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5471.76s)]
*  foreign policy with the Middle East will be pretty closely [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5478.8s)]
*  in sync with Israel where you'll at least be focused [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5482.4400000000005s)]
*  on the same problem, the same question [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5485.24s)]
*  and the reason we don't want Iran to get nuclear weapons, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5487.4800000000005s)]
*  maybe it's a crazy theocracy and it will use them [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5493.0s)]
*  but even if Iran doesn't use them, just having them [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5496.4400000000005s)]
*  will somehow change the whole playing field [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5500.08s)]
*  and I think one of the international things [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5502.16s)]
*  a president was supposed to do post 1945 [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5504.400000000001s)]
*  was stop nuclear proliferation because if too many countries [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5507.52s)]
*  get nuclear weapons that's one of the ways [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5510.92s)]
*  we sleepwalk to Armageddon because eventually something, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5512.96s)]
*  if you have 100 countries with nuclear weapons [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5515.6s)]
*  I don't think that's a stable game theory equilibrium [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5517.72s)]
*  of the world and one of the lessons I take [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5521.0s)]
*  of the mid 20th century was every time a country [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5525.08s)]
*  got a nuclear weapon, we got a regional war. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5528.12s)]
*  The Soviet Union gets the bomb in 1949, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5531.16s)]
*  the Korean War starts in 1950 because when the Soviet Union [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5533.84s)]
*  backs North Korea, we can't bomb Russia [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5537.8s)]
*  and then they can back North Korea with impunity [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5541.52s)]
*  and we get a massive, massive regional war [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5543.96s)]
*  and that's in a way the price for being asleep [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5546.96s)]
*  and letting the Soviets get the bomb. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5551.240000000001s)]
*  1964, communist China gets the bomb, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5553.320000000001s)]
*  Vietnam War explodes in 1965 and again, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5556.52s)]
*  China can back North Vietnam with impunity, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5560.280000000001s)]
*  we can't reciprocate and then the way I understand [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5563.400000000001s)]
*  why would an Iranian nuclear bomb be a catastrophe [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5569.0s)]
*  because the degree to which Iran can support this [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5573.16s)]
*  and you know, plethora of bad actors, the Houthis, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5578.2s)]
*  the Mos people and Hezbollah and on and on [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5582.12s)]
*  throughout the Middle East, you could not retaliate [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5586.8s)]
*  against Iran. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5589.4s)]
*  If they are nuclear power, you can't retaliate [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5591.44s)]
*  against Iran and then the degree to which they will support [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5593.72s)]
*  the whole Middle East will explode and so we don't have [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5598.24s)]
*  to go to the sort of crazy theocracy that's gonna, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5602.5599999999995s)]
*  that said they'd use the bomb and would use it. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5607.72s)]
*  I think it's just the nature of it and I think there's a way [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5610.04s)]
*  that Israel understood this and there's a way the neocons [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5613.96s)]
*  lost the forest for the trees. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5618.84s)]
*  There were ways the Israelis and the Saudis [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5622.0s)]
*  probably had misgivings about the Iraq war [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5624.56s)]
*  because Iraq was the country that's blocking Iran [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5627.04s)]
*  and if you weaken Iraq, aren't you strengthening Iran [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5630.4800000000005s)]
*  in the end? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5633.88s)]
*  In some sense. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5635.320000000001s)]
*  In some sense, that's what happened over 20 years. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5636.639999999999s)]
*  Trump over the past 48 hours has made a number of appointments [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5640.4s)]
*  on this score. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5643.4s)]
*  It looks like Marco Rubio is gonna be the secretary [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5644.24s)]
*  of state, Michael Walls is gonna be a national security [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5647.16s)]
*  advisor, Elise Stefanik is going to the UN. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5650.2s)]
*  That's a pretty hawkish group. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5654.0s)]
*  I think they're all pretty hawkish on China [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5657.68s)]
*  and I think that is probably, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5660.5599999999995s)]
*  that's probably the other place where, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5663.080000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna say things are coming to a head, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5673.120000000001s)]
*  but where we have to really find a better balance [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5674.52s)]
*  than we've found in the past few decades. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5685.68s)]
*  I think, I think, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5693.080000000001s)]
*  I believe all of them, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5699.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say that they will prioritize China [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5702.96s)]
*  at the expense of everything else, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5705.160000000001s)]
*  but I think they will prioritize China [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5706.92s)]
*  more than the Biden administration [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5714.360000000001s)]
*  and more than the Europeans would. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5716.92s)]
*  One last question and then I wanna talk about [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5720.6s)]
*  sort of the future of the right and populism. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5723.0s)]
*  There's a sort of grotesque thing happening [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5725.56s)]
*  in certain precincts of the right [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5727.88s)]
*  where I guess the way to describe it would be [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5729.96s)]
*  sort of like a revival of Patrick Buchanan's view [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5732.72s)]
*  of things like World War II that felt pretty settled. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5736.72s)]
*  Hitler's the villain, Churchill saved the West. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5740.64s)]
*  I'm sure you've noticed some of this. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5743.400000000001s)]
*  And I wonder where that historical revisionism [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5745.64s)]
*  is coming from and why you think it's so seductive [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5749.88s)]
*  to people in this moment. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5753.76s)]
*  Man, these things are always difficult to score culturally, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5758.92s)]
*  but I'm tempted to say that the, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5769.08s)]
*  I mean, you never wanna defend the Nazis [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5773.92s)]
*  and you never wanna defend Hitler. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5776.76s)]
*  And it's just, there are probably some fringe people [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5778.72s)]
*  who say they're on the right that do this, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5784.64s)]
*  but isn't this 90% a left-wing Psy-op of sorts [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5786.84s)]
*  where it is, I don't know, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5792.8s)]
*  the first rule of high school debate is whoever, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5797.08s)]
*  brings up Hitler first loses. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5801.2s)]
*  Hitler loses, right. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5802.24s)]
*  And this was in a way what. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5803.08s)]
*  But a lot of people on the right [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5804.44s)]
*  are bringing up Hitler on their own. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5805.4s)]
*  You don't see it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5808.599999999999s)]
*  I don't see people doing it in a positive way. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5809.44s)]
*  Here's how I would put it. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5817.68s)]
*  Let me maybe. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5818.76s)]
*  You have to, yeah, I want you to give me [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5819.599999999999s)]
*  the actual quotes where. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5822.88s)]
*  Okay, let me phrase it another way. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5824.8s)]
*  And I don't think even Buchanan would do this. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5826.44s)]
*  I challenge you to come up with even a Buchanan quote. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5830.4400000000005s)]
*  He wrote a lot over decades where. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5833.4800000000005s)]
*  Let me phrase it another way. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5837.2s)]
*  There's a strain on the right right now. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5838.96s)]
*  To go back to what you said about how make America great [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5842.32s)]
*  again was sort of the ultimate, I've never heard that. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5844.68s)]
*  It's really insightful. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5846.88s)]
*  Like the ultimate pessimistic slogan. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5848.76s)]
*  I think there is a group on the right [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5851.24s)]
*  that feels so, let's be generous, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5853.4400000000005s)]
*  alienated, enraged, frustrated [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5857.84s)]
*  at the direction of the country [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5861.6s)]
*  that they've given into a kind of nihilistic, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5863.320000000001s)]
*  we deserve for everything to fail. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5867.4400000000005s)]
*  We deserve for everything to burn it down. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5869.52s)]
*  I don't think that's correct. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5874.16s)]
*  And certainly there's a way that's all that can be [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5876.64s)]
*  is like a negative, self-fulfilling, new age, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5881.4400000000005s)]
*  bad prophecy. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5884.8s)]
*  Where if you're a white supremacist who thinks [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5885.96s)]
*  that the white people are all gonna be losers, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5889.72s)]
*  I don't know if you're correct, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5894.24s)]
*  but what I suspect you personally will do [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5895.92s)]
*  is you will eat a lot of donuts and move into a trailer. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5898.24s)]
*  And so it's a self-fulfilling negative prophecy [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5901.16s)]
*  about what will happen in your life. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5904.8s)]
*  And so yes, I don't believe in doing [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5907.16s)]
*  anything like that at all. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5910.24s)]
*  I think there are ways that the US is overstretched. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5913.64s)]
*  There are ways that we have to, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5919.0s)]
*  I'm not sure prioritize, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5922.96s)]
*  but there are some kind of constraints. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5924.04s)]
*  There's some kind of way in which we don't have the money. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5928.320000000001s)]
*  There's no money left. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5931.72s)]
*  And there is the budget deficits, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5933.160000000001s)]
*  there are things like this. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5936.84s)]
*  There are certain types of constraints. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5937.68s)]
*  If I had to do the history, the 20th century history, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5940.32s)]
*  and I don't think this is revisionist, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5947.0s)]
*  but the way I would tell the history of the 20th century [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5948.4s)]
*  is that we had two World Wars. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5952.92s)]
*  And the thing that's extremely confusing [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5955.2s)]
*  about the two World Wars [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5958.32s)]
*  is that they teach diametrically opposite lessons. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5960.08s)]
*  And the lesson of World War II [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5963.44s)]
*  is you do not appease dictators. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5966.56s)]
*  And if you give an inch, they will take a mile. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5972.52s)]
*  And you let Hitler take the Sudetenland, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5974.8s)]
*  and then it was all Czechoslovakia, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5977.76s)]
*  and then Austria, and then it just went on and on and on. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5979.56s)]
*  And then, but World War I teaches the opposite lesson, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5987.320000000001s)]
*  which is you don't want to have a network [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5992.92s)]
*  of secret alliances, entangling alliances [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=5997.36s)]
*  with hair trigger mobilization and escalation schedules, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6001.24s)]
*  where you have this tinderbox in Sarajevo, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6006.36s)]
*  where the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6010.24s)]
*  somehow triggers this four-year conflagration [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6013.08s)]
*  that destroys Europe. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6018.36s)]
*  And that in a way, the place where appeasement [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6020.080000000001s)]
*  came from in the 1930s, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6027.160000000001s)]
*  and in part it was because it felt like there was no money, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6029.360000000001s)]
*  the Depression, everybody was bankrupt, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6031.8s)]
*  you couldn't spend money on the military, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6034.280000000001s)]
*  you couldn't spend money on anything. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6035.52s)]
*  But part of it was, okay, this is the way we course correct [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6037.04s)]
*  for World War I, we're not gonna have [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6040.72s)]
*  this hair trigger escalation. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6043.160000000001s)]
*  And then the difficult paradox [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6045.16s)]
*  is if we're going to avoid World War III, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6050.48s)]
*  I think you somehow have to learn the lessons of both wars. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6054.639999999999s)]
*  And so somehow you can't have excessive appeasement, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6058.96s)]
*  and you also can't go sleepwalking into Armageddon, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6064.96s)]
*  and they're in a way opposite lessons. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6068.5199999999995s)]
*  And then perhaps, I won't say [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6071.12s)]
*  that you should be 100% World War I [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6076.12s)]
*  and 0% World War II, but my contrarian intuition [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6077.84s)]
*  where I'd be maybe 60, 70% focused on World War I [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6081.96s)]
*  and 30 or 40% on World War II, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6086.64s)]
*  is I think we always have a recency bias. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6089.24s)]
*  We're always fighting the last war. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6091.88s)]
*  And the last World War was World War II, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6094.360000000001s)]
*  and so that's the one we're obsessed with [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6098.08s)]
*  drawing the lessons from. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6099.84s)]
*  And my contrarian intuition is that if we have a World War, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6103.24s)]
*  it'll be more like World War I. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6107.56s)]
*  It'll look like what's been happening the last few years [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6109.400000000001s)]
*  where it's this gradually escalating conflagration, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6111.84s)]
*  but it will happen overnight. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6115.360000000001s)]
*  World War II people could see coming for a long time. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6121.6s)]
*  World War I had this crazy feeling. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6124.68s)]
*  The other thing that's more like World War I [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6128.56s)]
*  than World War II is World War I, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6130.6s)]
*  the pre-World War I world, was one [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6134.160000000001s)]
*  that was incredibly connected through globalization, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6136.84s)]
*  through trade and finance. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6140.200000000001s)]
*  One of the books that I think's always [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6141.8s)]
*  a super interesting one to read is 1910, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6143.160000000001s)]
*  Norman Angel wrote this book, The Great Illusion. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6146.240000000001s)]
*  What was The Great Illusion? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6150.0s)]
*  It was this best seller, sold books around the world, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6151.120000000001s)]
*  all the countries that would eventually fight World War I. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6154.96s)]
*  What was the thesis? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6157.360000000001s)]
*  The Great Illusion was that there could be a World War, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6158.8s)]
*  and there could not be a World War [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6163.2s)]
*  because everybody would lose. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6166.599999999999s)]
*  And it would make as much sense, according to Norman Angel, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6169.4s)]
*  for the UK to go to war with Germany [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6172.2s)]
*  as it would make sense for London [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6177.16s)]
*  to invade the county of Hertfordshire, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6179.8s)]
*  the adjacent county to London, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6185.24s)]
*  because the stock market in London would go down [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6187.32s)]
*  more than the value of any property [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6190.5599999999995s)]
*  could grab in Hertfordshire. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6192.679999999999s)]
*  In a world that was connected through finance and trade, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6194.44s)]
*  and that felt very global like it was in 1913, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6198.5199999999995s)]
*  it was obviously insane to have a World War. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6203.719999999999s)]
*  And then it nevertheless happened. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6207.04s)]
*  And then I think there's a way [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6209.44s)]
*  that the globalization regime was deeply unhealthy, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6212.54s)]
*  deeply unstable, and those are the kinds of lessons. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6216.08s)]
*  I definitely think there are, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6223.08s)]
*  you don't wanna be Chamberlain, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6225.04s)]
*  you don't wanna sort of be doing those mistakes [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6226.36s)]
*  from the 1930s at all. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6231.28s)]
*  I also think it's worth thinking very hard [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6233.28s)]
*  about where was Norman Angel wrong? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6236.72s)]
*  And why did The Great Illusion turn out [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6240.0s)]
*  not to be a great illusion at all? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6245.28s)]
*  Populism is in vogue right now. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6247.96s)]
*  And populism is something that always makes me wary, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6250.8s)]
*  because populism leads to scapegoating, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6254.72s)]
*  and scapegoating leads to blaming minority groups, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6257.4s)]
*  and often Jews. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6260.48s)]
*  And I see this sentiment, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6261.6s)]
*  and you're seeing it playing out on Twitter all the time, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6264.48s)]
*  people love this phrase, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6266.44s)]
*  a lot of people on the right, popularly Vox Dei, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6267.56s)]
*  voice of the people is the voice of God. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6270.32s)]
*  And I can't think of a wronger thing [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6271.88s)]
*  that has been said, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6274.84s)]
*  I don't think the voice of the people [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6276.4400000000005s)]
*  are the voice of God. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6277.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6280.16s)]
*  I wonder if, you're someone who looks back to history, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6283.0s)]
*  obviously, how do you contain populist energies [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6286.6s)]
*  and harness them in a productive way [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6291.28s)]
*  without them running roughshod [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6294.04s)]
*  over any number of minority groups? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6297.12s)]
*  Well, let me start in a slightly [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6300.04s)]
*  different way, and this is plagiarizing sort of an idea [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6305.400000000001s)]
*  that Eric Weinstein likes to popularize a lot, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6307.76s)]
*  but it's this thing called a Russell conjugate, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6309.88s)]
*  which is two words that are synonyms, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6313.0s)]
*  but are emotional antonyms. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6319.360000000001s)]
*  And so a think and a whistleblower, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6322.12s)]
*  maybe it's the same thing, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6326.4400000000005s)]
*  but a whistleblower is a good person, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6327.8s)]
*  and a think is a bad person. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6329.400000000001s)]
*  So they're emotional antonyms, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6330.84s)]
*  even though they're kind of the same thing, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6332.28s)]
*  if you think about it. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6335.28s)]
*  And I would submit that a Russell conjugate of sorts [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6336.679999999999s)]
*  is populism and democracy. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6342.88s)]
*  And democracy is good, populism is bad, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6346.2s)]
*  and it's democracy when people vote the right way, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6351.12s)]
*  and it's populism when they vote the wrong way. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6354.08s)]
*  And what that tells us is that [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6357.32s)]
*  there's probably a lot in these concepts [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6362.36s)]
*  that needs to be really, really unpacked. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6366.28s)]
*  I share your concerns about populism. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6380.12s)]
*  I also have concerns about democracy [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6384.599999999999s)]
*  for the exact same reason. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6387.4s)]
*  If everyone just gets to vote on everything, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6389.84s)]
*  that's just rampant majoritarianism, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6394.08s)]
*  and there obviously are all sorts of ways [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6396.92s)]
*  that minority rights get oppressed, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6399.400000000001s)]
*  or the libertarian version is that wealthy people [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6402.76s)]
*  probably just have their property voted away from them, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6405.88s)]
*  so they don't respect property rights, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6407.88s)]
*  minorities get trampled on, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6409.88s)]
*  so there are all sorts of ways [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6411.56s)]
*  in which we're not supposed to have rampant majoritarianism. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6413.28s)]
*  And then the kinds of checks on that, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6418.08s)]
*  it was republicanism is supposed to be a check on democracy [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6423.64s)]
*  where the people don't vote on things directly, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6427.2s)]
*  they vote on them indirectly, and you elect representatives. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6430.44s)]
*  And then the constitution is supposed to be [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6433.04s)]
*  a check on republicanism, where even the legislature [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6435.12s)]
*  can't just do whatever it wants, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6438.24s)]
*  and it has to still be compatible with the constitution. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6439.5199999999995s)]
*  And then that's kind of the intuition [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6442.639999999999s)]
*  I would have about our society. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6450.12s)]
*  Now I do wonder if this is not that accurate [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6451.879999999999s)]
*  as a description of the United States. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6458.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think we are too populist or too democratic, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6461.879999999999s)]
*  because yeah, maybe there's a mob of voters, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6466.5599999999995s)]
*  but they don't really get to do all that much [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6469.5599999999995s)]
*  on a day-to-day basis. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6473.0s)]
*  And the problem, I would say, is maybe more [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6473.92s)]
*  that we're less of a constitutional republic [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6477.96s)]
*  than we used to be. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6481.84s)]
*  And it hasn't shifted from the constitutional republic [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6483.04s)]
*  to this mob of voters, but it's shifted [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6486.44s)]
*  from the constitutional republic [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6489.24s)]
*  to this sort of unelected technocratic bureaucracy, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6491.12s)]
*  the deep state, things like that. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6496.28s)]
*  And maybe that's what you need to have [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6499.44s)]
*  in a technologically advanced society, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6500.8s)]
*  where you need experts, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6503.28s)]
*  you need a central intelligence agency, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6505.24s)]
*  you need to have secrets, secrets about nuclear weapons, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6507.96s)]
*  secrets about other things. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6510.52s)]
*  And so there are all kinds of ways [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6511.84s)]
*  that an advanced technological society, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6513.64s)]
*  by its very nature, is far less populist or democratic [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6517.16s)]
*  than the US was even in its 18th century conception. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6523.6s)]
*  One of the things I've been thinking about since Tuesday, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6527.64s)]
*  but really over the past few years, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6531.4400000000005s)]
*  is this sort of intramural fight between the elites, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6533.8s)]
*  what you've called the Borg or the NPCs or the Blob, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6540.64s)]
*  the group think that controls so many of our institutions [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6544.88s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6548.360000000001s)]
*  and then what you've described as the Rebel Alliance. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6550.04s)]
*  There's a debate, I think, happening inside [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6553.64s)]
*  the Rebel Alliance, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6557.2s)]
*  between people who are maybe on the more radical fringe of it, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6558.16s)]
*  who say, we don't need institutions really, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6561.04s)]
*  we don't need gatekeepers, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6564.12s)]
*  or there's something about gatekeeping in and of itself [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6565.32s)]
*  that's corrupting. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6568.0s)]
*  And I think you can see this, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6570.36s)]
*  let's just, I'll use a specific example. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6571.48s)]
*  Part of this whole like, make America healthy again, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6574.92s)]
*  MAHA movement, RFK phenomenon, I think is very healthy, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6577.24s)]
*  and it's about a skepticism of big pharma, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6581.96s)]
*  and a skepticism, an idea that, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6584.32s)]
*  why should we go along with the fact [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6587.08s)]
*  that there's chemicals in all of our food? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6588.44s)]
*  Why shouldn't we be skeptical of the fact that, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6590.2s)]
*  35% or something crazy like that of American kids [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6593.84s)]
*  have pre-diabetes, these crazy health outcomes, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6596.96s)]
*  so let's be skeptical. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6599.4s)]
*  But then it can tip just so fast [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6600.96s)]
*  into vaccines cause autism territory. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6603.32s)]
*  And I guess I wonder how you think about the fine line [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6606.28s)]
*  between skepticism of maybe an elite [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6609.68s)]
*  whose gatekeeping has been too strident, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6614.84s)]
*  or too zealous, or too narrow, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6618.400000000001s)]
*  and falling into a rabbit hole, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6620.72s)]
*  or falling maybe off the map, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6623.6s)]
*  where you're in a place where there's sort of, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6626.360000000001s)]
*  no gatekeeping, and no institutional authority at all. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6630.400000000001s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6635.08s)]
*  Yeah, these are not, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6636.08s)]
*  man, you always ask really easy questions, Barry. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6637.4s)]
*  I've just been thinking about this one so much, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6640.72s)]
*  because I've watched the understandable emotional arc, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6643.04s)]
*  where people who were told you're a conspiracy theorist, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6647.44s)]
*  only to have their conspiracy, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6651.24s)]
*  let's say about the origins of COVID be proven right, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6652.68s)]
*  but by that time they've already fallen off [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6655.2s)]
*  into the deep end, where they're trafficking, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6657.0s)]
*  and all kinds of things that seem truly crazy. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6659.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, let me articulate [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6663.16s)]
*  all these different types of institutions. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6668.44s)]
*  You can do this with intelligence agencies, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6670.2s)]
*  or with, I don't know, environmental institutions, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6672.3s)]
*  but maybe one kind of institution [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6678.92s)]
*  where you can ask this question about is science [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6681.74s)]
*  as an institution. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6684.12s)]
*  And the way I always think of the history of science [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6685.76s)]
*  was that it started as a two-front war [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6690.46s)]
*  against both excessive dogmatism and excessive skepticism. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6694.86s)]
*  And so if you are, in the 17th and 18th century, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6701.42s)]
*  a scientist was a heterodox thinker [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6705.5s)]
*  who didn't believe in, let's say, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6708.82s)]
*  the decayed Aristotelian scholasticism [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6710.92s)]
*  of the Catholic Church, and you were, maybe, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6714.06s)]
*  were empirical, and there were these dogmas [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6717.42s)]
*  that you were open to questioning. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6720.46s)]
*  But you also couldn't be extremely skeptical. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6722.26s)]
*  So if you can't trust your senses, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6726.099999999999s)]
*  and if I don't believe you're sitting there, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6731.34s)]
*  extreme skepticism was also incompatible with science. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6733.84s)]
*  So extreme dogmatism was incompatible, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6736.54s)]
*  extreme skepticism is incompatible. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6738.76s)]
*  And the problem is, yeah, it's easy to be against one, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6741.54s)]
*  but if you're always just against dogmatism, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6746.38s)]
*  then maybe you're too skeptical of everything. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6751.02s)]
*  And if you're always against skepticism, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6753.32s)]
*  maybe you're too dogmatic. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6756.5s)]
*  And so there's this very complicated balance [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6758.62s)]
*  where we need to be both anti-dogmatic and anti-skeptical. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6762.38s)]
*  And probably, my feel for it would be [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6767.74s)]
*  that in the 17th and 18th century, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6772.74s)]
*  it was probably more anti-dogmatic than anti-skeptical, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6777.46s)]
*  but it was some of both. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6780.099999999999s)]
*  But if we fast forward to 2024, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6782.26s)]
*  and you asked scientists, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6785.74s)]
*  where is science too dogmatic, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6790.46s)]
*  and where are people too skeptical, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6793.9s)]
*  where are people being too dogmatic? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6797.62s)]
*  And I think there are a whole long list of things [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6799.78s)]
*  where they say there are climate change skeptics, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6803.74s)]
*  there are vaccine skeptics, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6807.0599999999995s)]
*  there are Darwin skeptics, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6809.0199999999995s)]
*  there are all these people who are too skeptical, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6812.86s)]
*  and the skepticism is undercutting science. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6818.179999999999s)]
*  So we're on war of skeptics of all sorts. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6820.099999999999s)]
*  And then if you asked the scientists, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6824.8s)]
*  where are the scientists too dogmatic, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6826.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think they could tell you a single thing [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6830.34s)]
*  where science is too dogmatic. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6833.96s)]
*  And doesn't that tell you [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6836.46s)]
*  that we have completely lost the sense of balance, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6838.94s)]
*  and we are way too, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6842.12s)]
*  that what has become science, [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6844.62s)]
*  you square quotes around science, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6848.34s)]
*  is something that is more dogmatic [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6850.259999999999s)]
*  than the Catholic Church was in the 17th century, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6853.179999999999s)]
*  and that at the margins, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6856.34s)]
*  yeah, you can't go all out skepticism, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6863.620000000001s)]
*  and obviously there's a slippery slope to nihilism, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6866.860000000001s)]
*  and that doesn't work, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6869.9800000000005s)]
*  but directionally that's where we have to course correct. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6871.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6877.660000000001s)]
*  and then you have to go through all these specific issues [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6878.780000000001s)]
*  and think about it. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6881.900000000001s)]
*  I don't particularly think that vaccines lead to autism. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6883.74s)]
*  If they did, I don't think our science [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6889.54s)]
*  is capable of figuring it out, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6891.7s)]
*  because the results would get suppressed, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6893.179999999999s)]
*  because it would undercut the lobby for vaccinations, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6895.139999999999s)]
*  and there obviously are a lot of good vaccines too, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6902.26s)]
*  and if there was some truth to it, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6904.82s)]
*  that would undercut it, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6910.38s)]
*  and I'm pretty sure that question isn't being investigated. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6912.34s)]
*  There has been a dramatic increase in autism [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6915.98s)]
*  in recent decades. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6920.0199999999995s)]
*  We don't have particularly good explanations for it. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6921.42s)]
*  Surely it's something we should be thinking about more, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6924.54s)]
*  and yeah, so again, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6927.86s)]
*  I don't think vaccines lead to autism. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6929.9s)]
*  I do think it's the sort of question [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6933.94s)]
*  that it would be healthy if we were allowed to ask [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6937.16s)]
*  a little bit more than we are. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6938.9s)]
*  And of course, there were all, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6942.5s)]
*  we just went through this crazy exercise [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6945.78s)]
*  with the COVID epidemic, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6948.22s)]
*  where we somehow cut off skepticism so prematurely, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6950.94s)]
*  so many times, where not only was the skepticism healthy, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6957.06s)]
*  but the skeptics were right, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6961.46s)]
*  and so people were skeptical of the, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6963.14s)]
*  eating the bat from the food market, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6968.38s)]
*  and no, you need not be so dogmatic [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6970.26s)]
*  about the bat, eating bats theory, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6976.740000000001s)]
*  and it was no, it was actually the whole hand lab. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6979.18s)]
*  And somehow the eating bats theory [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6980.02s)]
*  was the politically correct theory, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6981.42s)]
*  which is kind of unbelievable. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6982.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's disgusting to be a bat. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6984.18s)]
*  What sort of a society is it where people are starving [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6985.26s)]
*  so much they need to eat bats? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6987.76s)]
*  But I think the fear is if you go down the, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6989.42s)]
*  hey, maybe vaccines cause autism, please, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6993.780000000001s)]
*  you can wind up very, very quickly in a place [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6995.9800000000005s)]
*  where polio is back and measles are back, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=6998.22s)]
*  because you see what I mean. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7001.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7003.46s)]
*  How do you know when you've gone too far [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7005.7s)]
*  in the skeptical direction? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7006.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I conceded there is a point where you go too far, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7009.58s)]
*  but at the same time, my feel for it is that directionally, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7015.38s)]
*  the science establishment is way too far [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7022.12s)]
*  on the dogmatic side, way too little on the skeptical side. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7026.14s)]
*  Maybe we take climate change as an issue. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7031.38s)]
*  Maybe there's some part of it that I believe is true, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7036.860000000001s)]
*  but there are a lot of parts that are open for debate. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7044.46s)]
*  Maybe methane is a bigger greenhouse gas [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7049.46s)]
*  than carbon dioxide, in which case [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7051.9800000000005s)]
*  cows flatulating in the Amazon are worse than [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7055.02s)]
*  when cars running on oil. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7060.38s)]
*  And then you have all sorts of questions about, [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7065.34s)]
*  all sorts of layers of things that can't be discussed. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7072.9400000000005s)]
*  So my intuition is these institutions have gotten [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7079.1s)]
*  very, very unhealthy. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7083.06s)]
*  There's always a culture wars riff I have on this, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7085.38s)]
*  where those of us on the conservative side [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7087.620000000001s)]
*  who critics the universities often focus on the humanities [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7093.22s)]
*  as the part that's most corrupt, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7097.38s)]
*  and it's most transparently corrupt. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7101.9800000000005s)]
*  But the sciences are more esoteric. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7104.18s)]
*  If the cancer researchers haven't made any progress [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7109.26s)]
*  in curing cancer in 50 years, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7113.42s)]
*  or the string theorists made even less progress in physics, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7114.54s)]
*  but these things are so esoteric, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7119.219999999999s)]
*  isn't that a hint that maybe the sciences [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7121.78s)]
*  are even more corrupt? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7123.5s)]
*  The government analogy I always use is, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7125.139999999999s)]
*  which is the most messed up agency in the government? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7128.7s)]
*  Is it the post office, the DMV, or the NSA, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7132.82s)]
*  the National Security Agency? [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7136.78s)]
*  And I would submit it's obviously the NSA, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7138.54s)]
*  because you can go to the DMV and the post office, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7141.9s)]
*  and you can see that people are sitting around [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7144.62s)]
*  loping all day and not doing much work, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7146.38s)]
*  and it's obviously corrupt and non-functioning, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7148.139999999999s)]
*  and it's so transparently corrupt [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7150.74s)]
*  that it's maybe not that bad. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7152.82s)]
*  At the NSA, we have no clue what they're doing, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7154.299999999999s)]
*  and then my political intuition is that that's a clue, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7156.98s)]
*  that it's probably more corrupt, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7161.139999999999s)]
*  more mismanaged than the post office or the DMV. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7164.38s)]
*  We had two, the Harvard versus Stanford tale [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7168.18s)]
*  of the two university presidents that were fired, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7172.38s)]
*  I went to Stanford, it was Claudine Gay at Harvard, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7174.26s)]
*  it was the diversity woman who plagiarized [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7178.900000000001s)]
*  all these things, and everybody could see [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7183.62s)]
*  that there was a lot that was ridiculous, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7187.42s)]
*  it was transparent that she deserved to be fired. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7189.1s)]
*  Same year, Mark Tessier-Levin, the neuro white male [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7191.820000000001s)]
*  neuroscientist, who as far as I can tell, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7198.54s)]
*  all of his research was multi-decade fraud, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7201.780000000001s)]
*  stole tens of millions of dollars, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7205.22s)]
*  but it's like, it's this complicated question of, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7207.54s)]
*  are you gonna go through all these papers [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7214.820000000001s)]
*  and show that the photos were doctored in a certain way? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7217.06s)]
*  I'm not saying the sciences are necessarily worse [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7223.740000000001s)]
*  than the humanities, but they both failed. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7226.66s)]
*  It's just harder to see, you're saying, if it was. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7229.9s)]
*  And then my intuition is that that has to be [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7232.22s)]
*  a really important part of the story of what's gone wrong [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7234.22s)]
*  with the universities, with our society, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7237.94s)]
*  and there's probably some part where we haven't asked [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7247.34s)]
*  enough questions, we haven't been skeptical enough. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7252.66s)]
*  And this is where, I don't know, not sure RFK or Joe Rogan [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7256.26s)]
*  or any of these people are correct about everything, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7263.46s)]
*  but it's so much fresher, so much healthier [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7269.46s)]
*  than this incredible echo chamber [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7273.3s)]
*  that is the consensus mainstream media, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7278.54s)]
*  or that is the group think of peer-reviewed science. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7282.74s)]
*  Even if that skepticism and the freshness is coming [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7286.62s)]
*  as it is right now with a lot of, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7291.58s)]
*  there's a lot of ugliness that's attendant to that, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7296.38s)]
*  flinging open of the gates. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7298.7s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7301.3s)]
*  Yeah, although I wanna say maybe we're exposing [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7302.98s)]
*  the ugliness that is unfortunately part of these things [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7307.82s)]
*  that are not quite working as well as they're supposed to, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7312.1s)]
*  and that maybe these institutions have been really, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7315.620000000001s)]
*  really broken for a while, and we need to somehow [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7319.9800000000005s)]
*  find a way to have this conversation. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7323.820000000001s)]
*  Let's imagine 100 years from now, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7325.3s)]
*  and someone's looking back at this whole, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7327.38s)]
*  at the story of the late 20th century, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7330.820000000001s)]
*  and then of course the 21st century [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7332.820000000001s)]
*  that I think you would argue sort of started late. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7334.620000000001s)]
*  If we boiled it all down, is it really just all the story [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7337.9800000000005s)]
*  of the technological revolution of the internet [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7342.66s)]
*  that has fundamentally changed our politics, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7345.82s)]
*  the tone of it, the language of it, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7348.78s)]
*  that it led to Trump's rise, that it has brought [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7351.7s)]
*  the collapse of so many of our institutions? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7354.0599999999995s)]
*  Is that the headline story [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7356.98s)]
*  that you think is gonna be written? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7358.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm always a little bit hesitant [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7362.219999999999s)]
*  to make it completely about tech, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7364.94s)]
*  because in a way that's the, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7367.5s)]
*  when you say the tech is omnipotent, omniscient, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7369.86s)]
*  if it's not omnibenevolent, it's omnimolevolent, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7375.58s)]
*  and it's sort of, you sort of turn it into [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7378.299999999999s)]
*  the Judeo-Christian God or something like that, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7382.339999999999s)]
*  and then it's always my Gerardian cut is [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7386.54s)]
*  if you make something into God, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7389.58s)]
*  you are making it into a scapegoat [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7392.099999999999s)]
*  for all the problems too, and so that's sort of where [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7393.66s)]
*  I'm always, that's where I'm instinctively hesitant [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7396.42s)]
*  to do this, but with that qualification, yes, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7399.58s)]
*  I think it's an incredibly important change. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7403.74s)]
*  I think there are ways the internet made things transparent [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7408.74s)]
*  that were not transparent, and there are a lot of things [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7413.02s)]
*  that did not work, do not work as well [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7418.18s)]
*  when they're made transparent. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7421.14s)]
*  Markets become more efficient [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7423.3s)]
*  if they're made more transparent, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7424.7s)]
*  and then scapegoating probably works less well [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7427.74s)]
*  if it's transparent, if we think that [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7430.82s)]
*  we have a psychosocial problem, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7434.62s)]
*  we need to pretend someone's a witch to solve it, [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7436.22s)]
*  it's probably, we're gonna be less motivated witch hunters, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7438.7s)]
*  and it will not have the kind of cathartic effect [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7441.38s)]
*  it might have still had in some medieval society, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7444.26s)]
*  and the question is always, is politics like markets, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7447.82s)]
*  or is it like scapegoating? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7452.38s)]
*  The internet in some ways has deconstructed, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7453.66s)]
*  exposed the politicians, there's a way Trump [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7459.099999999999s)]
*  was the first internet president, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7465.46s)]
*  and this was a thought I had already in 2016, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7467.62s)]
*  man, all the other people, they didn't realize [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7471.3s)]
*  how fake they looked, they don't realize [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7473.18s)]
*  how incredibly fake they are, and yeah, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7475.78s)]
*  you can do this fakeness in this pre-internet world, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7478.62s)]
*  even television was a deconstructive medium [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7482.86s)]
*  which was hard for them to master, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7485.299999999999s)]
*  but the internet was, it really exposed the fakeness, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7488.7s)]
*  and then there is a part of it that feels lossy [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7493.179999999999s)]
*  because these institutions don't work as well anymore, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7497.5s)]
*  and I don't think we can do without them, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7500.98s)]
*  and we haven't quite figured out [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7502.78s)]
*  how to get through to the other side, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7504.219999999999s)]
*  but I also have this, this is the place where I have it, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7507.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know, historicist, even progressive view, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7513.46s)]
*  I don't think you can go back, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7516.139999999999s)]
*  and you can't un-invent the internet, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7517.86s)]
*  and so we have to find a way through it, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7521.82s)]
*  but yeah, I think it changed things in very, very big ways, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7526.46s)]
*  and certainly one can focus on the economics [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7533.54s)]
*  and the incredible wealth creation, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7536.7s)]
*  but I think it was also this thing [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7540.46s)]
*  that was socially and culturally significant. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7542.9800000000005s)]
*  There's always a science fiction riff I have on it, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7546.82s)]
*  I'm never quite sure this is completely correct, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7549.14s)]
*  but I think in a way, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7551.54s)]
*  all these science fiction books that are written, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7555.3s)]
*  there are books where they anticipate things [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7557.1s)]
*  sort of like the internet, where you have like, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7559.34s)]
*  you can go on your computer and you can read books on it, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7561.86s)]
*  but this sort of small packet modality of information [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7564.42s)]
*  is like 140 characters on Twitter, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7568.94s)]
*  and the ways in which this would radically change [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7571.58s)]
*  the nature of society, I don't think it was anticipated [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7574.419999999999s)]
*  by any science fiction novel to speak of, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7578.86s)]
*  and so maybe the internet was the biggest invention [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7582.099999999999s)]
*  that was not anticipated [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7586.419999999999s)]
*  by any science fiction writer at all, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7588.7s)]
*  and what I submit that might tell you [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7591.82s)]
*  is that it represented sort of a change [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7595.46s)]
*  in the nature of human consciousness [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7597.42s)]
*  or the structure of a society that's more radical [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7599.82s)]
*  than we think, because it was not anticipated by anybody. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7602.9400000000005s)]
*  But your famous line, of course, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7607.5s)]
*  is we were promised flying cars [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7610.9800000000005s)]
*  and all we got is 140 characters, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7613.14s)]
*  but maybe what you're saying is the 140 characters [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7614.9800000000005s)]
*  are more revolutionary. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7617.06s)]
*  They are revolutionary on a social, cultural level. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7621.5s)]
*  I always question how much they added to GDP, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7627.46s)]
*  how much they add to economic growth. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7633.38s)]
*  There's a way, as human beings, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7636.9400000000005s)]
*  I always think we're material, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7639.3s)]
*  we're embedded in an atomic world, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7640.82s)]
*  and so if you have a shiny surface on your iPhone [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7643.22s)]
*  and the screen you're addicted to [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7648.66s)]
*  and you don't notice you're in a subway in New York [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7649.86s)]
*  that's falling apart and you're in a decrepit apartment [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7652.38s)]
*  with lots of rats in it, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7655.9800000000005s)]
*  this world of bits is not really a substitute [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7660.82s)]
*  for the world of atoms. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7664.38s)]
*  So there's a way in which I still stick with that concern. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7665.9s)]
*  I would like us to be making progress [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7672.54s)]
*  on all these other fronts, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7674.14s)]
*  but I don't want to minimize the way [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7675.54s)]
*  in which the internet was significant, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7680.1s)]
*  politically and culturally, [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7681.26s)]
*  even if it didn't make the millennials [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7682.9s)]
*  much wealthier than the boomers. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7686.66s)]
*  Peter, given the fact that you were, [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7688.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I would say predicted this moment, [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7690.62s)]
*  but you were definitely, definitely early. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7693.299999999999s)]
*  And given how right you are in the bets that you make, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7695.54s)]
*  I think people would love to know, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7698.259999999999s)]
*  what are maybe the books or the essays that you read [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7700.62s)]
*  that you think best either predicted this moment [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7704.179999999999s)]
*  or explain the moment that we're living in? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7707.259999999999s)]
*  Wow, I'm so bad at that. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7709.179999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you mine. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7711.179999999999s)]
*  I think Martin Gurey's book, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7712.9800000000005s)]
*  The Revolt of the Public was extraordinary. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7714.780000000001s)]
*  Trump's not mentioned in the book, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7720.5s)]
*  it came out before the whole Trump phenomenon. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7722.18s)]
*  He focuses on the Arab Spring [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7724.54s)]
*  and really just the way that the tension [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7726.42s)]
*  between the center and the periphery [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7730.700000000001s)]
*  or maybe what Neil Ferguson would call it, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7732.18s)]
*  the tower and the square and the way that the center, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7734.14s)]
*  the square sort of sees power. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7737.02s)]
*  That's the book I'm recommending a lot to people right now. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7741.1s)]
*  Maybe I'll give a negative answer. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7743.66s)]
*  The one that somehow, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7746.38s)]
*  The contrarian as always. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7747.18s)]
*  The one that somehow I think got it completely wrong, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7748.700000000001s)]
*  but I still don't know what it means, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7753.900000000001s)]
*  is the Fukuyama book, The End of History. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7755.900000000001s)]
*  And history was supposed to end [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7764.02s)]
*  in this sort of social democratic liberalism. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7765.78s)]
*  And it's sort of unclear [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7770.259999999999s)]
*  and this seemed very correct in the 1990s. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7775.86s)]
*  And then obviously 9-11 sort of suggested [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7778.78s)]
*  that things can move in a somewhat retrograde direction. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7782.78s)]
*  And then of course, the rise of China, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7787.3s)]
*  it didn't seem exactly liberal, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7791.179999999999s)]
*  but people had hopes that as China became wealthier, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7792.54s)]
*  it would become more Western and more liberal. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7795.9s)]
*  And then I always say, Xi comes to power in 2012, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7799.06s)]
*  but 2017 is when he's made president for life. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7803.54s)]
*  And in some sense, 2017 is maybe the year [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7807.22s)]
*  that the end of history comes to an end. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7811.06s)]
*  And then it's very confusing what this means [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7817.14s)]
*  because we do wanna make sense of our history [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7820.06s)]
*  and where it's going. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7822.9400000000005s)]
*  And if it's not over, if it's open, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7824.820000000001s)]
*  I always come back to its, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7832.46s)]
*  we can talk about trends and forces, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7835.660000000001s)]
*  but it does matter what people do. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7838.02s)]
*  And there's room for human agency, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7841.820000000001s)]
*  for individual agency, for thought. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7844.18s)]
*  And I think part of what will shape it, I hope, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7846.58s)]
*  are conversations like the one we had today. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7851.5s)]
*  Peter Thiel, thank you so much for coming on Honestly. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7854.0199999999995s)]
*  Honestly. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7856.74s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43Y&t=7857.66s)]
