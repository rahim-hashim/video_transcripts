In 2023 and 2024, there were many things that were unsayable. Perhaps the most unsayable—at least in legacy media circles—was this: The President of the United States was not capable of being president because he was no longer mentally fit.
Those people who did break the taboo—who dared to notice Biden’s countless gaffes and stiff gait, those who recognized the reality of old age—including special counsel Robert Hur—were written off or smeared. Videos of the president—clips of Biden tripping and misspeaking—were rebranded by The New York Times as “cheap fakes.” People were told to disbelieve their eyes and ears.
It’s now the spring of 2025. Donald Trump is the president. And now the unsayable things are being said—most dramatically in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book, Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.
Tapper, a CNN anchor, and Thompson, an Axios reporter, interviewed more than 200 people for this book, which illuminates Biden’s mental decline, his enablers, and how the country was effectively run by committee in the midst of his clear cognitive impairment.
For those of us who thought it was bad—it was actually so much worse than anyone could have imagined.
Alex and Jake have chosen to call the effort to hide Biden’s decline a “cover-up.” Those are choice words from two mainstream media insiders, invoking memories of Watergate and Iran-Contra. And the cover-up they are referring to, of course, is that of the Biden family and the close circle of advisers around them, many of whom are still delusional about Biden’s state.
But cover-up might be the term that many Americans would use to describe the press’s coverage of Biden. How did ordinary people see more than people with White House press passes? And what does this all say about human nature, transparency, and groupthink?
This is a really illuminating conversation about presidential power, the lengths some will go to keep it, and how the media failed to report the story of a lifetime.

# The Great Biden Cover-Up | Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0)
*  From the Free Press, this is honestly an Einberg Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=0.0s)]
*  In politics in America in 2023 and 2024, there were many things that were unsayable. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4.0s)]
*  Perhaps the most unsayable, at least in legacy media circles, was this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=11.0s)]
*  The President of the United States is not capable of being the President. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=16.0s)]
*  And that is because he is no longer mentally fit to serve. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=21.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be Vice President. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=24.0s)]
*  I think she's not qualified to be President. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=28.0s)]
*  America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=30.0s)]
*  I was going to put him in the... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=34.0s)]
*  Thanks to all the members of Congress and Homeland Security Secretary, I'm not sure I'm going to introduce you all the way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=37.0s)]
*  Those people who said so, the people that broke that taboo, who dared to notice Biden's gaffes, his stiff gait, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=45.0s)]
*  those who recognized the reality of old age, including special counsel Robert Herr, were written off or smeared or said they were right-wing conspiracy theorists. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't think that Herr is a good-faith actor, and I think that 345 pages of that show that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=65.0s)]
*  I mean, he's not a neurologist, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=71.0s)]
*  Do you think Herr editorialized? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=73.0s)]
*  Oh, he definitely did. That report needed an editor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=75.0s)]
*  This kind of editorializing is unusual, peculiar, frankly, there's just no role for it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=78.0s)]
*  Videos of the president, clips of Biden walking to Air Force One, tripping, misspeaking. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=83.0s)]
*  They were rebranded by the New York Times as cheap fakes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=89.0s)]
*  Ordinary people were told to disbelieve their own eyes and ears. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, it's now the summer of 2025. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=98.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the president, Joe Biden lost, and now the unsayable things are being said. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=101.0s)]
*  Perhaps most dramatically in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book, Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, its cover-up, and his disastrous choice to run again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=107.0s)]
*  Tapper of CNN and Thompson of Axios interviewed more than 200 people for this book, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=119.0s)]
*  which illuminates Biden's mental decline, his enablers, and how the country was effectively run by a committee in the midst of Biden's clear cognitive decline. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=125.0s)]
*  For those of us who thought it was bad, and I was one of those people, it was way worse than I imagined. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=137.0s)]
*  Alex and Jake have chosen to call the effort to hide Biden's decline a cover-up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=145.0s)]
*  And those are choice words from two mainstream media insiders invoking memories of Watergate in Iran-Contra. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=151.0s)]
*  The cover-up they're referring to, of course, is that of the Biden family and the close circle of advisors around them, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=158.0s)]
*  many of whom, according to Thompson and Tapper, are still delusional about Biden's mental state. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=165.0s)]
*  But cover-up might be the word that many Americans would use to describe the legacy press during Biden's presidency and his reelection campaign. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=172.0s)]
*  How did ordinary Americans, tens of millions of them, see more than people with White House press passes and deep sources in Washington? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=181.0s)]
*  That question has driven a lot of the reaction to this book, including the backlash. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=190.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has got cancer. He's written off. He's in decline. The family is disgraced. It's easy now to write about that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=197.0s)]
*  It was hard and would have required intellectual courage, moral fortitude to say this when he was the most powerful man in the world. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=205.0s)]
*  And so, Jake Tapper, you failed that test. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=213.0s)]
*  Don't news people have to tell you what they know when they find it out? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=215.0s)]
*  Isn't that the difference between news and a secret? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=224.0s)]
*  What does all of this say? Not just this book, the entire experience of the Biden presidency, his reelection and the way it was covered. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=232.0s)]
*  What does it say about human nature and about cowardice when people are meant to be truthful and courageous? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=241.0s)]
*  This is an illuminating conversation about power in the White House and in the press corps and the length some people will go to keep it and how the American press failed to report on the story of a lifetime. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=249.0s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=263.0s)]
*  Alex Thompson, Jake Tapper, welcome to Honestly. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=270.0s)]
*  It's so great to be here. Thanks, Barry. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=273.0s)]
*  So let's first talk about the book and assume that most people heard about it but haven't read it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=274.0s)]
*  I read the entire thing in one sitting this weekend. I could not put it down. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=279.0s)]
*  I would say the vast majority of Americans who are not hyper online and not paying attention to every clip that's surfacing on Twitter like the three of us noticed maybe Joe Biden falling off of that bike in Delaware in 2022. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=282.0s)]
*  And then, of course, they saw that disastrous debate performance. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=296.0s)]
*  But what your book does is it goes into incredible detail showing how these were not one off glitches in the matrix of his mind, but that these were sort of typical of a man who is however old he is now in incredible decline. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=300.0s)]
*  Can you guys go back in time and help explain to everyone watching and to me when that process began? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=319.0s)]
*  Our reporting shows, according to people that worked for Joe Biden that began in 2015 with the death of his son, Bo, one eight at the time sort of described the effect it had on his psyche as pouring water onto sand. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=328.0s)]
*  People that saw Joe Biden, you know, in 2017 2018 felt like he had aged a decade and just two or three years. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=344.0s)]
*  Now, they say that he was still, you know, mostly good, but that he would meander. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=352.0s)]
*  He would have off moments as the way he was, you know, being able to follow conversation was off. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=357.0s)]
*  You also have in our reporting that when special counsel Robert Herr, who we'll get into later, but he was investigating Joe Biden at this time and found a lot of tapes with Joe Biden's speechwriter, and they were shocked at how hard it was to follow him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=363.0s)]
*  You also saw, you know, on the campaign trail in 2019, he would have moments when he was like, huh, now the people on, you know, and including forgetting the name of his longtime political adviser, Mike Donilon, who had been with him since 1981. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=381.0s)]
*  Now, you know, people rationalize it because those moments were offset by more good moments than bad moments. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=397.0s)]
*  Like anyone that's aging, you have bad hours and good hours, good days and bad days. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=408.0s)]
*  And according to people there, you know, the good days outweighed the bad days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=412.0s)]
*  And they all the people that were around Joe Biden at that time believed he was the best person to take on Donald Trump in 2020. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=415.0s)]
*  So even though, you know, the decline began before 2020, and he was not the same Joe Biden as he was in 2015 when he was elected in 2020, it still was different. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=423.0s)]
*  And then I do think there is a much more, you know, aging is so funny because it's not a straight line. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=436.0s)]
*  And I think there was our reporting suggests that there was also a marked downward shift beginning in late 2023. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=443.0s)]
*  And again, one of the precipitating factors of that was family tumult. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=451.0s)]
*  And that was Hunter's plea deal falling apart, a special counsel being appointed to prosecute him and him facing potentially decades in prison that culminated in a very dramatic trial in just the weeks before the debate that exposed all the families dirty laundry to the world. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=457.0s)]
*  I would say the right wing meme about Joe Biden was that Dr. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=476.0s)]
*  Jill Biden was sort of the shadow president sort of running the country. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=480.0s)]
*  What your book shows is that that's not totally far off. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=484.0s)]
*  It's not Jill Biden, though. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=487.0s)]
*  It's this group, this group of tight advisors around Joe Biden. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=489.0s)]
*  I want you to talk about that you call the Politburo, which is an interesting word choice. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=492.0s)]
*  Tell me about the word choice and then tell me about those people who were really calling the shots around the president. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=496.0s)]
*  So the Politburo, not a term we came up with, a term from within the Biden administration, as the name would suggest, is a tightly held group of senior advisors. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=502.0s)]
*  Mike Donnellan and Steve Rashaddy foremost among them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=513.0s)]
*  You also have individuals floating in and out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=517.0s)]
*  Ron Klain, who's chief of staff for the first couple of years of the president's term. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=519.0s)]
*  Anita Dunn. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=524.0s)]
*  Some senior individuals on the staff of Jill Biden, the first lady, Anthony Bernal, the chief of staff, perhaps the most powerful first lady chief of staff ever. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=526.0s)]
*  And then another woman named Annie Tomasini. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=538.0s)]
*  And so we would assess that it's basically the Bidens, Joe, Jill and Hunter, and this tight group of aides. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=540.0s)]
*  And they weren't like a star chamber. They weren't like all friends or allies. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=548.0s)]
*  They all just had their different portfolios and did what they did. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=551.0s)]
*  And these were the individuals that helped steer the government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=555.0s)]
*  Now, is that different from any other president? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=559.0s)]
*  On one level, no. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=562.0s)]
*  On one level, obviously, a first family has its priorities and every president has aides. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=564.0s)]
*  But on another level, yes, definitely. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=570.0s)]
*  There was more power vested in these individuals, according to cabinet secretaries that we spoke with, who said that at best Joe Biden was the senior member of a board. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=573.0s)]
*  And that the Politburo was cordoning him off, starting basically in 2023, 2024. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=583.0s)]
*  And I would just add to what Alex noted. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=590.0s)]
*  One of the challenges for all of us as voters and as members of the media was trying to figure out what was Joe Biden just aging, Joe Biden just having gaffes and stumbles as he has had throughout his career, and what was some evidence of serious cognitive decline. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=592.0s)]
*  And what our reporting suggested is that starting in 2015, there was the fine Joe Biden that we saw basically on the campaign trail most of the time in 2020. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=609.0s)]
*  And then there was the non-functioning Joe Biden. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=619.0s)]
*  And that's the one we saw the night of the debate, who couldn't even articulate a thought, who couldn't come up with words, who couldn't—he lost his train of thought on the way to the station. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=622.0s)]
*  And that non-functioning Biden reared his head over and over and over. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=633.0s)]
*  And by the end, it's hard to not believe, at least according to the cabinet secretaries that we spoke with, that there wasn't a tremendous amount of power vested in the hands of the Politburo. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=636.0s)]
*  As one cabinet secretary said to us, sure, the president could be making the decisions, but if we're not—we, meaning the cabinet secretaries, are not even allowed to talk to him, and our evidence is being presented to the president by the Politburo, what kind of choice is really being made? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=646.0s)]
*  And a simplistic way to do this would be if we told your executive producer, Ralph, Barry can have any flavor of ice cream she wants for dessert. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=663.0s)]
*  And Ralph came to you and said, you can have chocolate or vanilla. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=671.0s)]
*  OK, you've chosen presumably chocolate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=674.0s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=677.0s)]
*  I like vanilla. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=679.0s)]
*  Oh, really? OK. So you've chosen vanilla. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=680.0s)]
*  But how much did you really have a say in the choice? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=682.0s)]
*  And that is the—that's a very simplistic metaphor here, but the idea of what are the decisions being brought to him in terms of his decision-making. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=685.0s)]
*  Give us a little bit more color, guys, in the way that the people around him created—I don't know what the right word would be—maybe crutches to allow non-functioning Biden to work. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=694.0s)]
*  So I remember, and you guys will remember the exact day of this in a way that I won't, when he gave a press conference and someone got a—seraptitiously took a picture of the note card in his hand. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=707.0s)]
*  And it was very strange because it had the image of the reporter. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=718.0s)]
*  I think she was from the LA Times. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=722.0s)]
*  I don't exactly remember. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=724.0s)]
*  And then had, like, all of the words he should say, but, like, very, very rudimentary, like, say thank you kind of thing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=725.0s)]
*  And this was one of the things that rocketed around the Internet. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=734.0s)]
*  Yeah, it still does. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=737.0s)]
*  Right. But never sort of got sussed out by the legacy press. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=738.0s)]
*  And then when I'm reading this book, what I discover is that those sort of note cards were used even in, like, cabinet meetings, which I don't know if it was the exact equivalent thing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=741.0s)]
*  Even in private cabinet meetings. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=752.0s)]
*  Okay. So tell us a little bit more about that for people that haven't read Original Sin yet. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=754.0s)]
*  So some of these things began innocently enough, right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=757.0s)]
*  Right. Like all politicians use note cards to some extent. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=761.0s)]
*  All politicians use teleprompters. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=763.0s)]
*  All politicians prefer to pick on certain reporters at press conferences, right, and are usually directed. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=766.0s)]
*  Now, what started as, like, you know, just people trying to make their principal look good grew and grew as he struggled more and more. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=773.0s)]
*  So the one that you're talking about, my understanding of it, is because every single time the Biden had a press conference, the White House press team would hand select which reporters they wanted to pick. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=782.0s)]
*  And actually, I thought that was more of like the crutch because the White House press team knows which reporters are going to ask the questions on certain topics that he feels more comfortable with. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=796.0s)]
*  And so it was very select. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=806.0s)]
*  I mean, I cover, for instance, like I covered the Biden White House for four years and I never got a question. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=808.0s)]
*  And once they picked you, then the White House press team would sort of like, you know, cozy on up and be like, what are you interested in? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=813.0s)]
*  You know, and sort of do that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=823.0s)]
*  And I think in that instance, the reporter probably just like was a little too honest in like saying this is the topic I'm interested in. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=825.0s)]
*  And the way that they really sort of like filtered what the public saw was by hand selecting which reporters. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=836.0s)]
*  The other things, you know, for instance, we're talking about the note cards. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=846.0s)]
*  So what members of the cabinet told us is that basically there were scripts for cabinet meetings and not just when cameras were in the room, but when cameras were out of the room before a cabinet meeting. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=849.0s)]
*  And this goes back to 2021. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=858.0s)]
*  They were so seemingly worried about him being off script that they would, aides would go to the cabinet secretaries and say, what do you want to ask? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=860.0s)]
*  Or if he asked this question, what is your going to be your answer? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=869.0s)]
*  And one cabinet secretary literally described them to us as scripts for the meeting and that sometimes even when the cameras were out of the room, they were even weirder and more stilted. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=872.0s)]
*  They just said that because I mean, now the cameras are out, you're still like reading, you know, from and their preselected answers. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=885.0s)]
*  And it doesn't feel like I mean, cabinet meetings, you know, the White House would say like cabinet meetings are always sort of stilted. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=893.0s)]
*  But even even with that weird bar of a big cabinet meeting, they felt they were odd and at times discursive and just, you know, in some ways troubling. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=899.0s)]
*  And just to just to pick up from what Alex is saying. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=912.0s)]
*  So and that these things evolve or devolve to the point that, first of all, in October 2023, that's the last cabinet meeting they have for almost a year. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=914.0s)]
*  I mean, it's shocking for people listening. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=926.0s)]
*  How often are cabinet meetings typically held? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=929.0s)]
*  Maybe like four or five times a year. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=931.0s)]
*  It depends on the president. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=933.0s)]
*  And cabinet meetings are I imagine are typically the sites of like pretty raucous debates or at least passionate conversation about like the most important issues facing the country. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=935.0s)]
*  It's they should be. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=945.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to pretend that every every presidency, every cabinet meeting is like that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=946.0s)]
*  I mean, it's an opportunity if you're the leader of the free world to like find out what's going on in every agency in your administration. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=950.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=959.0s)]
*  It's probably true to say it's probably accurate to say that one on ones or one on twos are more productive for a president. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=960.0s)]
*  But that said, to not have a cabinet meeting for almost a year is stunning. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=967.0s)]
*  They were also shielding members of the cabinet from even smaller meetings, too. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=972.0s)]
*  That's what several members of the cabinet told us. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=976.0s)]
*  And then the other thing is so it starts off with teleprompters for President Biden to address the vote of the president. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=978.0s)]
*  For President Biden to address the voters from his basement when he's running for president during covid in 2020. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=986.0s)]
*  And then it's not that dissimilar in 2021 when people are still in the throes of covid, etc. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=993.0s)]
*  We can all understand a president using a teleprompter. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=998.0s)]
*  Sure. But by 2023, he has teleprompter set up in the homes of rich folk for fundraisers for like a meeting that he might have for 40 or 50 people. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1001.0s)]
*  Any president of the United States, Barry, you if you go and speak to 40 or 50 people for whatever, you're raising money for the free press or somebody asked you if you could stop by and do that, whatever, you would be able to speak. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1013.0s)]
*  Ficheting of our midstful, whatever, whatever it is, you would be able to speak for 10 minutes like it's not that difficult, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1026.0s)]
*  It's not that difficult. And if it is, then you'd be in the wrong line of work. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1033.0s)]
*  This was the president of the United States unable to do this at a fundraiser in front of 40 or 50 people. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1037.0s)]
*  And this was the rule, not the exception, starting in 2023. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1043.0s)]
*  And people started to get alarmed when they saw this, but not publicly. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1047.0s)]
*  I think just to underline it for people, I was one of the people that watched these videos of Joe Biden. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1050.0s)]
*  And I think Nellie was honestly hip to it before I was and thought the president is not there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1058.0s)]
*  Like the president, I use many words to describe it, but the president is not there. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1065.0s)]
*  And it is I don't know if it's a cover up or the extent of it, but something very untoward is happening in a White House that's allowing this to happen. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1069.0s)]
*  That's my feelings. Yeah. What shocked me in reading the book was how much worse it was than I thought. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1078.0s)]
*  And the extent to which they all sort of they all knew and they all worked together. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1085.0s)]
*  And I want you to kind of take people in. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1091.0s)]
*  I want you to give like the the steel man argument for what people like Mike Donlin, Steve Reschetti, Anthony Bernal, like any any whatever. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1094.0s)]
*  Yeah. What were they telling themselves? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1104.0s)]
*  I'd say the first thing first and foremost is they believe Joe Biden was the best position to beat Donald Trump. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1106.0s)]
*  They believe Donald Trump was an existential threat to democracy. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1113.0s)]
*  And if you believe those two things, it's very easy to rationalize the rest. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1116.0s)]
*  I also think that from the perspective of that inner inner circle, they believed he was a great president. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yes, was he slower? Yes. Was he like mixing up names and forgetting people? And could he do a speech anymore? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1126.0s)]
*  No. Was he limited in his hours? Yes. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1133.0s)]
*  But they still believed and I think some of them still really do believe that he was still making good decisions and was directionally putting like the country and the world on a better path. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1137.0s)]
*  I also think they had an overinflated sense of how good a job they were doing, which is not to say that he didn't accomplish anything or that history might remember him completely differently and think he's one of the greatest presidents ever. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1150.0s)]
*  I have no idea what history is going to think. No, I mean, I'm not betting on it, but who knows? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1161.0s)]
*  But, you know, towards the ends of the of the Biden presidency, when we were doing interviews for this book, it was made very clear to me by a top aide that they thought he was great. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1166.0s)]
*  They thought he was a great president, that this is a member of the Politburo, that, you know, OK, maybe he stumbles on some names, maybe he doesn't walk as quickly. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1175.0s)]
*  But he just broke with his peace deal in Gaza, which obviously was very short lived and unsuccessful and not anything that is going to get him a Nobel. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1183.0s)]
*  But, you know, at the time they were really excited about it and they just saw him as a man of LBJ or FDR like accomplishments and could not understand what everybody else was seeing. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1191.0s)]
*  They really feel that way to this day. They feel that way to this day. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1203.0s)]
*  They think that he could have won and they think that he could be president until January 20, 29. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1206.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why. When you say they do you mean the people you've been naming? Yes. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1211.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, I mean, specifically, I would say Donald and Rashidi, Bernal and the family. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1216.0s)]
*  And they think that to this day, which is one of the reasons why I think the family and the and the Politburo have a difficult time pushing back on this book in any successful way, because they are so not grounded in reality to think that Joe Biden could be president until January 20, 29. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1222.0s)]
*  I mean, their prebuttal to have Biden and Jill, the First Lady and the president go out on the view, they thought that was going to quell arguments about his age when obviously all of us saw that and thought, what are you doing? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1242.0s)]
*  He looks horrible. She's finishing finishing his sentences. But that's not how they view it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1254.0s)]
*  One of the things people will wonder who have read the book or not, it's really a human question is how were there not dissenting voices inside the White House who watched the note cards, watched the fact that they were keeping his schedule between the hours of what were the hours? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1260.0s)]
*  10 and 4. 10 and 4. Yes, I mean, there were days we have like one day that we sort of highlight in October of 2023, where his day basically he has a few meetings from like 10 to 1. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1278.0s)]
*  And then he has POTUS time. He has like two and a half hours, two hours, 15 minutes of POTUS time, then a half hour of desk time, then I think one meeting with the chief of staff, and then he is dinner slash down, which means like end of the schedule at 430 p.m. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1290.0s)]
*  And he went back. Usually that meant he went back to the residence. This is not Labor Day weekend. This is like I have not had a day like that. October 3rd, 2023. So where would get you on the phone? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1304.0s)]
*  My question is where were the voices inside the White House or around the Bidens? Like I thinking about someone not to not to choose someone, but someone like Jake Sullivan, right? Or someone like, you know, Anthony Blinken, people that are, you know, honorable people, high integrity, understand the stakes of having a commander in chief that's not able to function really past four or five p.m. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1316.0s)]
*  Where are those people in the mix here? The people that are not the pollsters that are not like the political hired guns, the people that understand what it might mean if he gets a call at two in the morning? What are they saying in 2022, 2023? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1342.0s)]
*  I think two things. One is I do think the foreign policy, even though they saw what was happening, I think some of the foreign policy people did have a distorted view because Biden was, you know, like sometime, especially sometimes you see this little people like if you get the right topic, they sort of like, you know, they clock back in. Right. So in foreign policy, he was at least a little bit more engaged than he was on other times. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1357.0s)]
*  Sometimes a lot more, to be honest. I mean, like with good days and bad days, I know towards the end of his presidency, when all that all the unrest in Syria was happening and Bashar al-Assad fell and this and that, our understanding is that President Biden was very engaged, which doesn't surprise us. We're not saying he's a vegetable. We're just saying he had some really bad, bad moments. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1382.0s)]
*  But I think it's a fair question for both of them, given that we did talk to some cabinet secretaries that did not have confidence that he could handle a two a.m. crisis. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1398.0s)]
*  I mean, you have this cabinet secretary in the book saying if you expect the president to be woken up at two a.m., Biden was not capable of that in twenty twenty four. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1409.0s)]
*  And what your reporting suggests to me is he wasn't capable of that in twenty twenty two, arguably. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1417.0s)]
*  Definitely not twenty twenty three. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1422.0s)]
*  I mean, what the cabinet secretaries, they specifically said twenty twenty four. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1424.0s)]
*  But how is no one internally saying this is not normal? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yes. Where are those people? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1431.0s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1432.0s)]
*  I think the origin of that, of why no one was dissenting is because the defining virtue in Biden world is loyalty. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1434.0s)]
*  And if you dissent is not taken as let's have a conversation, dissent is seen as disloyal. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1444.0s)]
*  And so I'd say two things happened. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1453.0s)]
*  One is people that did raise questions, like, for example, John Anzalones, who worked with Biden back in 1987 and was the pollster in twenty twenty. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1455.0s)]
*  He raises concerns about him running for reelection and thinks they should have a real process here. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1465.0s)]
*  And he basically is told no thanks. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1472.0s)]
*  And he's no and he's not part of the Biden reelect. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1475.0s)]
*  I'd say the other thing is, you know, that has that's happened to a lot of people in that world. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1478.0s)]
*  And I would say the main enforcer of sort of the loyalty principles is Joe Biden and Anthony Bernal. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1484.0s)]
*  But as a result, people get the memo and people don't speak up because they I mean, honestly, I think it's like more of a story of cowardice where they feel like they're going to be pushed out. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1490.0s)]
*  Now, there were small little things done, like, for example, Bob Bauer, Anita Dunn's husband and Biden's longtime lawyer. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1502.0s)]
*  You know, he they basically secretly had the DNC get a copy of the hard drive from Hunter Biden's laptop, prepare a dossier of sorts of like the most salacious details and then privately present it to Joe and Joe Biden. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1510.0s)]
*  And the message was all of this is going to come out this time. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1524.0s)]
*  Like we're not going to 24. Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1528.0s)]
*  We're not going to be able to get away with it like we did in 2020. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1529.0s)]
*  All this and like it's going to be very painful. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1532.0s)]
*  And it's going to be introduced as evidence in his trial also. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1534.0s)]
*  Yes. But again, that was those were subtle things. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1536.0s)]
*  And nobody, despite people having private concerns about Joe Biden running for reelection and his ability to beat Donald Trump and his ability to be president till 2029, which is what he was running to do. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1540.0s)]
*  No one got in his face. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1553.0s)]
*  One other thing is we talked about how the polyp here in the family talk themselves into believing in this ill fated endeavor by saying only Joe Biden has beaten Donald Trump, only Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1555.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is an existential threat to the to the United States. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1568.0s)]
*  That's also the argument as to why people kept their mouth shut. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1572.0s)]
*  You see people on the left today attacking me and Alex for writing this book. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1576.0s)]
*  Why aren't you covering Donald Trump as if we don't cover him every day? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1580.0s)]
*  And the argument is in this, you know, this world of only good and evil. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1583.0s)]
*  You're attacking the good and in service of evil. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1589.0s)]
*  That's the argument. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1593.0s)]
*  And I think that that went very far. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1594.0s)]
*  Look at the response to this book on Capitol Hill. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1596.0s)]
*  Nobody's dispute like we haven't had one factual dispute from any member of Congress, any member of the cabinet, any member of the Biden administration. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1599.0s)]
*  But Democrats are pretty quiet about it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1605.0s)]
*  You have some people acknowledging he shouldn't have run for reelection. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1609.0s)]
*  His cognitive abilities obviously declined. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1613.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy said that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1615.0s)]
*  But generally speaking, when Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are asked about this, they're like, we're looking forward. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1617.0s)]
*  We're looking forward. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1621.0s)]
*  There's no upside in being public and challenging the head of your party. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1622.0s)]
*  There's no incentive structure for courage in our politics today. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1629.0s)]
*  Although there were some people that were courageous, like Dean Phillips and others and some journalists that we'll talk about them in a minute. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1633.0s)]
*  One of the ways that I think the public knew that the people around Biden knew that something was wrong was the way they tried to spin things. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1639.0s)]
*  And there was, of course, like the one, you know, consistent spin, which was the president's always had gaffes. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1647.0s)]
*  He's not the best communicator. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1653.0s)]
*  And that is true. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1654.0s)]
*  But the other thing, and I don't exactly remember when this started to occur, but it was it happened and it was very, very much something they tried to make into a meme, was this idea that the presidency is not a person. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1656.0s)]
*  The presidency is the office of the presidency. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1667.0s)]
*  Do you guys remember that? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1671.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1672.0s)]
*  And they're still they're still doing it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1673.0s)]
*  Who was behind that idea? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1675.0s)]
*  Who created that spin? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1677.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't I don't know who created that specific one, but all all communicate most communications were handled by Anita Dunn. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1680.0s)]
*  So there was there was one person and I remember it's especially because it was said so casually where they said, listen, when you all Biden had to do was win. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1688.0s)]
*  And then he only had to occasionally come out for an occasional proof of life. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1700.0s)]
*  And he used the phrase proof of life. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1704.0s)]
*  Yeah. And their rationale was first beating Trump at B. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1707.0s)]
*  They were like, when you vote for a president, I think most voters understand you're voting for the people around them, too. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1712.0s)]
*  This is all that is stunning, right? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1717.0s)]
*  All of the interviews in the for this book took place after the election, except for that one. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1719.0s)]
*  And it's and it's to me the most stunning because it was not the most stunning. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1724.0s)]
*  There's a lot of stunning stuff in the book. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1729.0s)]
*  But but just the rationalization of proof of life. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1731.0s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1734.0s)]
*  That's not what the job is. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1736.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's something out of out of like a dystopian Hollywood thriller. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1738.0s)]
*  There were many failures of the Biden presidency. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1743.0s)]
*  There were many successes, too. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1746.0s)]
*  But some of the failures just to go through them, the Afghanistan withdrawal, the crisis at the southern border, inflation. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1748.0s)]
*  To what extent is your reporting show or do you guys feel that those failures were the result of his mental acuity? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1754.0s)]
*  So we have a scene in the book in June 2024. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1762.0s)]
*  Senator Michael Bennett, Democrat of Colorado, goes to the White House for an immigration event. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1765.0s)]
*  And it's a really disturbing event. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1769.0s)]
*  I don't know if you remember or if your viewers, listeners, readers remember, but he has like a glitch while he's talking and not just a doesn't remember the name of the DHS secretary. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1772.0s)]
*  He something happens and neurologists we talked to said it looked like something neurological. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1782.0s)]
*  Michael Bennett leaves that event and he thinks this is why our immigration policy is such a mess, because this guy can't manage the portfolio. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1789.0s)]
*  He can't handle all the competing interests in the Biden White House, the people who want to expand asylum claims versus the people who want to secure border. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1798.0s)]
*  And in fact, the DHS secretary, Mayorkas, thought that there was going to be an order early on in 2021 to secure the border. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1809.0s)]
*  I mean, people may or may not remember, but Obama deported a lot of people as president. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1817.0s)]
*  He was called deporter in chief by Jorge Ramos of Univision. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1822.0s)]
*  But that was what Mayorkas thought was going to be the rule, that there was going to be some crackdown on the border so there wouldn't be this free flow of undocumented immigrants and migrants, people of all sorts. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1825.0s)]
*  And that's that's Bennett's conclusion that this is why our policy is such a mess, because this guy can't handle it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1839.0s)]
*  I do wonder, I don't have any reporting to suggest otherwise, but I do wonder personally when it comes to the Recovery Act, the American Recovery Act, which is, you know, more pumping more money into the economy post COVID or during COVID. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1846.0s)]
*  Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, was out there warning this was going to be inflationary. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1862.0s)]
*  I don't know how much Biden was briefed on that, because in addition to the people hiding Biden from the world, they were also hiding the world from Biden. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1867.0s)]
*  They were also keeping information from Biden, poll numbers from Biden. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1878.0s)]
*  And so it really became very unhealthy. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1882.0s)]
*  So the answer is, I think quite a bit of it. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1886.0s)]
*  But there's more reporting to be done, and we're still reporting the book for the paperback. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1890.0s)]
*  One of the follow on effects that the book made clear to me, and I would love for you to expand on it a little bit, the what does it mean if the person who is the president is not actually the president or functioning as the president, but the people around him are? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1895.0s)]
*  One of the ways that you show that that played itself out is that Ron Klain, who was to Biden's left, was essentially running policy for the White House. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1908.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the picture that I took away from it is Biden, who you could argue was successful because he had run as a centrist and has sort of consistently been not on the furthest left wing of his party, did a lot of things as president that seemed like, wait, is this the same Biden? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1920.0s)]
*  Like, these are policies very much to his left. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1938.0s)]
*  To what extent is that the result of him not being fully there and Ron Klain calling the shots? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1942.0s)]
*  I mean, so this is what people in the administration told us. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1949.0s)]
*  Ron Klain was one of the most powerful chiefs of staff they've ever seen. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1952.0s)]
*  He not just ran policy, he had his fingers in every part of how that White House operated. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1957.0s)]
*  Coms, Capitol Hill relationships, and a lot of people in the administration, and this is where it's tough. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1963.0s)]
*  Biden always was a little differential to Ron Klain, but would he have, there are members of the cabinet and there are members, senior members of the administration that believe that Biden would not have been so differential if he had been 20 years younger. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1974.0s)]
*  There's a line in the book where he says, I'm not the smartest person in the room Ron Klain is or something like that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1988.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And that goes back, he thought Ron was a genius back when Ron worked for him on the judiciary committee in the late 80s. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=1992.0s)]
*  But this is I think also how people were like, is it because he's old or is it just because he trusts Ron? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2000.0s)]
*  And honestly, there's still disagreement. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2006.0s)]
*  But we have members of the cabinet that do believe and senior White House officials that believe that if Biden had been younger, he would have been more in the weeds. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2008.0s)]
*  I remember one person said something like Biden, like to me where it was like Biden won the presidency, but like Klain and the progressives won the transition. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2015.0s)]
*  That it wasn't just the direction that they set in policy, it was a lot of the personnel. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2026.0s)]
*  Ron Klain was very close to Elizabeth Warren and a lot of progressives entered the administration. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2033.0s)]
*  And to your point, Joe Biden had long been a centrist. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2040.0s)]
*  I mean, he was a guy that in 84 ran on a balanced budget constitutional amendment and then obviously ran, you know, did the crime bill. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2043.0s)]
*  It used to be a hawk on immigration. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2049.0s)]
*  And so some people do think that, you know, I think probably like the headiness of power, his age, his deference to Klain were all factors in the administration going to the left of where he had been for most of his career. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2051.0s)]
*  And this is why the progressives in Congress were one of the one of the last groups to abandon him. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2065.0s)]
*  The Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus were stuck with him to the end. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2071.0s)]
*  They thought he was the most progressive president in their lifetime. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2075.0s)]
*  In your view, if Biden had gotten that 2 a.m. phone call, some major crisis happening in the world in the middle of 2023, would he have been able to handle it? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2078.0s)]
*  And if he wouldn't have been able to handle it, who would have been handling it? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2090.0s)]
*  Who was functioning as a kind of shadow president? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2094.0s)]
*  So towards 2023, 2024, whenever there's one of these G20 or G7 or NATO or whatever meetings, Biden would participate as little as possible, especially when it came to the dinners. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2097.0s)]
*  He would not go to the dinners. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2109.0s)]
*  And Secretary of State Antony Blinken would go instead. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2111.0s)]
*  There's one time that Biden goes to bed early and there is a crisis. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2113.0s)]
*  It was that missile landing in Poland. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2119.0s)]
*  It turns out it was accidentally fired by Ukraine, but we didn't know, the world didn't know, oh, my God, is Russia actually now declaring war on Poland? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2124.0s)]
*  Like, what exactly is going on? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2131.0s)]
*  And because he was rested because he'd gone to bed early, it ended up being fine. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2133.0s)]
*  That's not to absolve him of anything, but it's just to say that was the only time, thank God, that we know of that there was a crisis. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2138.0s)]
*  But remember, during this entire period, there are dramatic fears that Russia is going to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2146.0s)]
*  And we have a president who cannot be relied upon for that 2 a.m. phone call, according to his own cabinet secretaries. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2154.0s)]
*  And as early as December 2022 is having difficulty coming up with the name of his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2161.0s)]
*  So I think that there is reason to question, even if definitively, thankfully, it wasn't proven out. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2168.0s)]
*  He had run sort of with an implicit promise that he was going to be a one-term president, given his age. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2177.0s)]
*  Wouldn't the moment have been given what they were already seeing in 2022 and 2023? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2183.0s)]
*  Hey, maybe he shouldn't run again in 2024. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2187.0s)]
*  Talk about the decision for him to run for reelection. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2190.0s)]
*  The basic thesis of this book is the most consequential moment of the entire election was Joe Biden running for reelection. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2194.0s)]
*  And it's one of the most consequential decisions in American history. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2200.0s)]
*  And what's really remarkable about it is how little process there was. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2204.0s)]
*  And I think that also speaks to the overall dynamic within Biden's world that basically Biden and the family were all in on [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2209.0s)]
*  and by the family, I mean, Jill and Hunter were all in. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2219.0s)]
*  They felt that he deserved it, that in some ways he was owed it, that he would beat Trump and that he was a great president. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2223.0s)]
*  And so when people said, hey, do we can we have a conversation about this stress test it? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2230.0s)]
*  And they were told by Mike Donilon, he's made a decision. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2236.0s)]
*  That was it. That was it. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2240.0s)]
*  The chatter, I remember at the time, was this idea because certain people, you know, in just private conversations would say, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2242.0s)]
*  I wish there was going to be a primary, people in power that I would speak to, let's say Democratic bundlers or whatever. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2248.0s)]
*  And the basic, like conventional wisdom was that it was all down to Joe Biden. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2254.0s)]
*  If Joe Biden had urged him to drop out, he would have dropped out. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2260.0s)]
*  But Joe Biden wanted him to stay in. So he stayed in. Is there truth to that? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2263.0s)]
*  There's some truth to it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2266.0s)]
*  I think that that takes away the president's own agency in this. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2267.0s)]
*  I mean, I think one of the things that can't be forgotten is that, you know, if we say that Joe Biden had many addled moments, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2273.0s)]
*  we're not saying that he is addled 100 percent of the time. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2280.0s)]
*  And he surely had to have been aware of his limitations, even if he was in somewhat of a denial about it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2283.0s)]
*  He had to. He's a he's a vain enough man that he looks in the mirror. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2290.0s)]
*  He's a vain enough man that he watches his speeches and can see how different he is now than he was 10 years ago, five years ago, two years ago. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2294.0s)]
*  And he had to have been aware. I think Joe Biden is key to this. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2302.0s)]
*  But I think that that there's like a Lady Macbeth kind of narrative that that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2306.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Is that real? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2312.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was definitely part of it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2314.0s)]
*  But I think that that I think that Joe and Hunter and their role in this can't be underestimated. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2316.0s)]
*  If surely if she had said, Joe, you can't do this anymore. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2322.0s)]
*  You need to step down or you need to let the next generation, he would have listened. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2326.0s)]
*  But that's just not who she is. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2331.0s)]
*  And she was certainly enamored of being first lady. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2333.0s)]
*  And she certainly believed in him. And she believed that only he could be Trump. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2335.0s)]
*  You know, Lady Macbeth suggests a lot of scheming and powerbogging and not to say that, you know, especially her her aid was not manipulative and did some of that. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2339.0s)]
*  But he seems very, very scummy. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2347.0s)]
*  But yeah. But Biden set the direction. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2349.0s)]
*  Jill was the enforcer. Yeah, it wasn't her being like, you know, you know, you have to do this and him being sort of like, you know, sort of ambivalent like and like in Macbeth. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2351.0s)]
*  You know, I just I think she is the enforcer of what he wanted to if she's well, not quite Lady Macbeth. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2364.0s)]
*  But if that's the sort of like caricature of her, what's the role of Hunter? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2371.0s)]
*  Explain Hunter's role. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2375.0s)]
*  Hunter is the I mean, in terms of the air and the spare, Bo Biden was the best of a Biden. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2376.0s)]
*  He would he was the attorney general of Delaware. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2385.0s)]
*  Who knows? He'd be president today if he hadn't gotten brain cancer. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2389.0s)]
*  Really good guy, upstanding guy enlisted in the military family man, et cetera. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2392.0s)]
*  And he passed away, obviously, tragically in 2015. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2396.0s)]
*  And Hunter was the spare between the air and the spare. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2400.0s)]
*  He was he was kind of the you know, I wouldn't call him a ne'er do well, but he just wasn't what his brother was. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2405.0s)]
*  And obviously he has addiction issues and he wouldn't call him a ne'er do well. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2411.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, he made a lot of money from barista. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2417.0s)]
*  I guess it depends how you define ne'er do well. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2419.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, cocaine addict. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2422.0s)]
*  I would say I would say he was an embarrassment to the family. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2424.0s)]
*  Sure. And I just mean, you know, he went to Georgetown Law School. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2428.0s)]
*  He's not a complete and utter failure. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2434.0s)]
*  People who know him say he's smart, say he's clever, et cetera. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2436.0s)]
*  Now, you know, I I don't particularly have high regard for him based on the role he plays in the story, you know, which is a which is a tragic one, which is his addiction issues and his, for want of a better word, drama. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2440.0s)]
*  I think is responsible for a lot of what happens to his father. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2456.0s)]
*  I mean, our reporting suggests that those two moments, the plea deal falling apart in the summer of 2023 and his trial and conviction in the summer of 2024 right before the debate are moments where there is serious deterioration by his dad. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2460.0s)]
*  And it's not just he's afraid that Hunter's going to go to jail. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2473.0s)]
*  He's afraid because Hunter's saying it openly that Hunter's going to relapse and Hunter's or Hunter's going to commit suicide. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2477.0s)]
*  And the idea of losing a third child because there's a horrible car accident and takes away life of his wife and daughter in 1972. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2485.0s)]
*  And then Bo dies in 2015. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2492.0s)]
*  He thinks he's going to lose the last remaining member of his first family and his third child. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2494.0s)]
*  And it is an awful moment. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2500.0s)]
*  And really just he's never Joe Biden never recovers from it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2504.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden, I think, sees in all of this an opportunity to redeem himself with his father by standing up for his dad, by standing by his dad, by insisting that his dad run for reelection, by insisting that his dad fight back against Robert Herr or fight back against anyone trying to push him out. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2508.0s)]
*  We know that at one point we report that Hunter was talking about running for mayor of Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2527.0s)]
*  And he wants to be redeemed. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2537.0s)]
*  He wants to be he wants to make his dad proud. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2541.0s)]
*  He wants to redeem himself to all those who consider him a ne'er do well. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2544.0s)]
*  And he wants to show that he he has what Bo had. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2548.0s)]
*  He has what his dad has. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2552.0s)]
*  But sadly, the role that he plays by doing what he's doing, advocating for his dad, because it's so blinded, he can't see what's happening to his dad. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2555.0s)]
*  The best advice, I think, it's obvious in retrospect, but maybe even obvious at the time, the best advice would have been take your one term, take your legacy, and then pave the way and have a Democratic primary system where this new generation of Democrats, all these Gen Xers run for office and the strongest one emerges and maybe is able to defeat Donald Trump. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2565.0s)]
*  He doesn't advise him to do that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2583.0s)]
*  He advises him to stay, to fight and run. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2585.0s)]
*  Do any of the people around Biden, not in the family, think it's odd that Biden is even considering the views of someone like Hunter? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2588.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2597.0s)]
*  Well, Anita and Bob. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2598.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2601.0s)]
*  So I would say because. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2602.0s)]
*  So do they think it's do they think it's bad? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2604.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2606.0s)]
*  Do they think it's weird? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2607.0s)]
*  It's a song. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2609.0s)]
*  Because like the Bidens and the family for you know, but the Biden political operation has always been a family affair. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2610.0s)]
*  His sister ran every single one of his political campaigns. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2618.0s)]
*  We've obviously seen how they've mixed the business side and the political side, not just with Hunter, but with Jimmy. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2621.0s)]
*  Even with like balance. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2629.0s)]
*  I mean, it's always been a family affair. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2631.0s)]
*  Yes. And so do people like Anita and Bob think it's a bad idea to be taking political advice from Hunter? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2642.0s)]
*  But you know, the thing is that like family is untouchable. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2643.0s)]
*  And by the way, like so Anita. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2647.0s)]
*  So Anita Dunn is the communications director or top communications aide. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2649.0s)]
*  Bob Bauer, her husband, who's Joe Biden's personal attorney. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2653.0s)]
*  They push back. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2656.0s)]
*  Hunter wants the White House to basically be the Hunter Biden defense organization in 2023, 2024. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2657.0s)]
*  They push back. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2666.0s)]
*  They say, no, we can't do that. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2668.0s)]
*  And they are basically shunted aside. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2670.0s)]
*  And they are basically after the debate goes poorly, family sources or sources close to the president blame Anita. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2673.0s)]
*  They endure the wrath of the Biden family. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2681.0s)]
*  And Anita Dunn leaves early. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2685.0s)]
*  She leaves the White House early and she goes and like works on the super PAC. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2686.0s)]
*  But but you know, there is a price for crossing the Bidens. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2690.0s)]
*  And the price is basically some form of excommunication. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2696.0s)]
*  Even though Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer were very loyal aides, they clashed with Hunter on this issue and they lost. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2700.0s)]
*  By late 2023, Biden is mixing up the name of his homeland secretary and his HHS secretary. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2710.0s)]
*  He says that the January 6th riot, insurrection, whatever you want to call it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2716.0s)]
*  The relevant thing is he says it happened actually on January 8th. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2721.0s)]
*  He said at a fundraising event and when he's explaining why he ran for president, I don't know why this one really stuck with me. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2724.0s)]
*  He tells the Charlottesville story and then just like as if the tape is starting over again, starts the entire story over again. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2731.0s)]
*  Just three minutes later without realizing it. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2738.0s)]
*  He doesn't recognize the DNC chair, who's one of his biggest advocates, this guy, Jamie Harrison. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2741.0s)]
*  Like some of these were captured on camera. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2747.0s)]
*  Many people saw them. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2751.0s)]
*  Explain to us the inability for people in the professional punditry and media class to not see those things for what they were. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2753.0s)]
*  I mean, I would say two things. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2763.0s)]
*  By the end of 2023, because some of these things are happening behind closed doors at fundraisers. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2765.0s)]
*  So the pool of people that are seeing him and alarm bells are ringing. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2771.0s)]
*  But it's all behind closed doors. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2775.0s)]
*  And Democrats rightly mock Republicans for saying one thing about Donald Trump in private and another thing in public. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2777.0s)]
*  They were doing the exact same thing. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2783.0s)]
*  They knew that and basically they were just like, he just needs to get to November. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2785.0s)]
*  That was their rationalization. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2790.0s)]
*  And in terms of the political and punditry, again, some of it was because, listen, he was deteriorating more behind closed doors. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2792.0s)]
*  Like the person that was in front of the cameras was always sort of designed, his schedule was designed to make sure it was the best version of him. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2802.0s)]
*  And he'd made gaffes like that for a long time. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2812.0s)]
*  Does it surprise like Joe Biden 20 years ago definitely would have mixed up the two Hispanics in his cabinet. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2816.0s)]
*  And so I think that's how I think some of it was rationalized. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2822.0s)]
*  Now, not to let the punditry and stuff off the hook. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2827.0s)]
*  They could have used those examples to try to find out more about what was going on behind the scenes. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2831.0s)]
*  And some were to give them credit. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2836.0s)]
*  Bill Maher in the early fall of 2023 was referring to Ruth Bader Biden. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2838.0s)]
*  David Ignatius wrote a column saying he needs to, he shouldn't run for reelection. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2844.0s)]
*  Maureen Dowd was out there saying he shouldn't run for reelection. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2848.0s)]
*  David Axelrod was there saying people, you know, Joe Biden needs to give an answer as to why the American people should elect a man who will be closer at the end of the next term to 90 than to 80. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2851.0s)]
*  So there were people saying it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2862.0s)]
*  Why weren't there more? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2864.0s)]
*  I think there are a number of reasons for that. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2866.0s)]
*  One of them, I think, is there's a difference between punditry and reporting. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2868.0s)]
*  So people who are in the reporting end of it maybe felt like there wasn't the language to describe all of this beyond showing the clips and saying there was an awkward moment today when such and such happened. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2873.0s)]
*  I think that there was also among the punditry class very much the Trump question. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2886.0s)]
*  Oh, you want to help Trump? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2893.0s)]
*  Is that what you want? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2894.0s)]
*  You want to help Trump? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2895.0s)]
*  And look at how vicious the Democratic Party and the Biden machine can be. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2896.0s)]
*  Look at what they did to Dean Phillips. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2902.0s)]
*  Isn't that really the story? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2905.0s)]
*  Isn't the story, the lack of curiosity isn't because people don't have eyes and ears. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2907.0s)]
*  They all do. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2912.0s)]
*  There's many smart people in many of these news organizations. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2913.0s)]
*  It's that they understood socially, reputationally, professionally, the kind of the social death of a kind or the smearing that they might experience if their curiosity went in the wrong direction. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2916.0s)]
*  Robert Herr, who we haven't really talked about yet. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2929.0s)]
*  Well, let me set that up for you. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2933.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2934.0s)]
*  People remember the Her report. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2935.0s)]
*  This was in February 2024. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2937.0s)]
*  The special counsel Robert Herr was assigned to investigate these classified materials on specifically, I think, the Iraq and Afghanistan war that Biden had kept hold of. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2939.0s)]
*  And he characterized Biden's memory, and I'll quote here, as significantly limited and said, talking about the president, that he was a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2951.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's how he would present to a jury. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2962.0s)]
*  Right. And and her was, I mean, called every name in the book. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2964.0s)]
*  A hack, right wing freak, gratuitous. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2969.0s)]
*  I mean, the vice president, Vice President Harris came out and attacked him. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2973.0s)]
*  Robert Herr, our reporting suggests, is a serious civil servant who took this job not knowing it was going to be an investigation of the president because he believes in the Justice Department and he believes in America as the child of immigrants, Korean immigrants. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2976.0s)]
*  He's an American success story. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2993.0s)]
*  Yes, he is conservative, but he took the job. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2995.0s)]
*  He was shocked when he listened to the tapes of Biden talking to his ghostwriter in 2017. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=2998.0s)]
*  And there are two reasons he shocked. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3007.0s)]
*  One, he hears Biden say something like, you know, I found the classified materials downstairs. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3009.0s)]
*  I mean, just like the smokiness of smoking guns. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3014.0s)]
*  And second, because Biden in 2017, 2018, as Alex was talking about, sounds incredibly old back then, losing his train of thought. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3017.0s)]
*  Can't come up with dates, can't come up with facts and figures. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3024.0s)]
*  Robert Herr has a meeting, has two meetings with President Biden in October 2023. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3027.0s)]
*  And what he encounters shocks him and his team to the core. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3033.0s)]
*  This is a man and we now have the Herr tapes. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3038.0s)]
*  They were released right before our book came out. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3040.0s)]
*  But before that, we had the transcripts. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3043.0s)]
*  So in 2023, it sounds like and it reads like the Biden that showed up on the debate stage. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3045.0s)]
*  Yes, maybe even worse. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3051.0s)]
*  Completely meandering, losing his train of thought, asked about one thing, is often running on like a story. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3052.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, he's like shooting bows and arrows in Mongolia. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3058.0s)]
*  Like no rhyme or reason. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3061.0s)]
*  Asked about this period, 2017, 2018, when he's writing this book. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3063.0s)]
*  And the president says, you have to understand during this period, my son, Bo, was either deployed or dying. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3068.0s)]
*  He had already died. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3075.0s)]
*  He had died in 2015 and he was deployed from 2008 to 2009. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3077.0s)]
*  Now, I don't doubt that Joe Biden loves his son Bo dearly and this was a horrible, devastating moment. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3081.0s)]
*  But he does not know the date of his death, does not know the year. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3087.0s)]
*  And he's asking people and people are telling him this is in the middle of the day in October 2023. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3092.0s)]
*  So anyway, her's report comes out and the White House goes to war, not only against her, against Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3097.0s)]
*  And a lot of people in the media participate. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3105.0s)]
*  A lot of people in the media are very complicit and part of the smear machine against Robert Herr. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3108.0s)]
*  And Robert Herr knows, Joe Biden comes out and says, he mentioned my son and I thought, how dare he bring that up? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3113.0s)]
*  That's not what happened. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3120.0s)]
*  He brought up 2017, 2018 and Joe Biden brought up Bo. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3121.0s)]
*  And Robert Herr is sitting there thinking, I didn't do that. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3125.0s)]
*  But people are so much invective is coming this way. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3129.0s)]
*  So much anger, so many attacks. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3132.0s)]
*  I know conservative gold star moms that were reaching out to me just because I have a foot in that world covering veterans a lot who were furious at Robert Herr. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3134.0s)]
*  Conservatives, Trump supporters, but furious that he would do that. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3142.0s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3145.0s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3146.0s)]
*  And the DOJ rules are we are not going to rebut a political attack. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3147.0s)]
*  When the transcript comes out, the transcript comes out. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3153.0s)]
*  But Robert Herr is smeared and cannot get a job for months. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3155.0s)]
*  And he was honestly, you look back at what he said, that was polite what he said. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3161.0s)]
*  Did you interview him for the book? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3166.0s)]
*  We're not allowed to say who we interviewed, but I feel confident talking about this part of the book. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3167.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3171.0s)]
*  I'd also just add one more thing to your point about sort of the way that reporters and pundits would be intimidated. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3172.0s)]
*  I mean, look at the response by many liberals to this book. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3180.0s)]
*  Like now do Trump. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3184.0s)]
*  What about Trump? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3185.0s)]
*  I mean, that was 20 times that in 2023, 2024. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3186.0s)]
*  The moment that all of this comes crashing down and it becomes undeniable is the presidential debate, Jake, that you were moderating. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3189.0s)]
*  Before we talk about the political ramifications of it, drop me into what the experience was like for you sitting there watching it. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3197.0s)]
*  Like, were you able to process in real time that this meant the end of his candidacy? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3211.0s)]
*  So that was a very surreal moment and worse in person than it was on TV. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3212.0s)]
*  Having gone back to watch the debate, to write this book with Alex, it was worse in person, I think just because it was the sadness and the patheticness of it all was right there in person. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3216.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's a very intense. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3226.0s)]
*  The debate's announced, I think, in May and, you know, then the attacks are just coming left, right and center against me, against Dana, against CNN, from the Biden camp, from the Trump camp. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3229.0s)]
*  And we're just trying to keep our heads down and just like do our jobs as honestly as benignly as possible, as unedgily as possible just to get to the debate. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3240.0s)]
*  We get to the debate. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3250.0s)]
*  We're supposed to go out there. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3252.0s)]
*  The debate's starting at nine o'clock. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3254.0s)]
*  We're supposed to go out there at about eight thirty, but we can't because Biden has chosen to not show up for the walkthrough at all. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3256.0s)]
*  Somebody from CNN calls Anita and says, what are you doing? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3264.0s)]
*  You have to come here and see that this is it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3267.0s)]
*  It happens every debate. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3269.0s)]
*  People do a walkthrough. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3271.0s)]
*  Oh, no, he's done a million of these. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3272.0s)]
*  He doesn't need to, which gives you an idea of their mindset. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3273.0s)]
*  They thought all we need to do is get Biden on the stage next to Trump. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3276.0s)]
*  Proof of life. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3280.0s)]
*  Everybody will say, well, I'd rather take that guy than the crazy man, Donald Trump. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3281.0s)]
*  That's what they thought. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3285.0s)]
*  But anyway, finally, Biden shows up and he, you know, he's so he's there until like eight fifty. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3286.0s)]
*  He's like going doing the run through. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3295.0s)]
*  So Dan and I go out there and it's ten of nine. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3296.0s)]
*  First of all, I'm a little older than everybody else in this room, I think. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3300.0s)]
*  But I'm fifty six and like nine o'clock, like I'm ready for bed. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3303.0s)]
*  Like I'm I'm ready to go to sleep. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3308.0s)]
*  You have babies, so it's different. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3310.0s)]
*  But like, I mean, you're ready to go sleep every minute. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3312.0s)]
*  But but I'm ready to go to sleep and I'm walking out there and I'm thinking, God, I have to do this for 90 minutes. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3315.0s)]
*  I'm already tired. I'm exhausted. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3320.0s)]
*  Like and then Biden walks out and I'm like, oh, my God, how is he going to get through this? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3322.0s)]
*  Because this is late. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3328.0s)]
*  But don't you remember the moment you walked out? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3329.0s)]
*  He made it was obvious. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3331.0s)]
*  He shuffles out. He looks super old and he has a cold and he's coughing. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3333.0s)]
*  And he and to people who hadn't been paying attention to the last year of him and the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3337.0s)]
*  diminishment of his ability just to stand upright. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3342.0s)]
*  And, you know, we have reporting in the book about people in the White House Physicians Office talking about wanting to maybe put him in a wheelchair if he has another fall. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3345.0s)]
*  He comes out. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3353.0s)]
*  The debate starts. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3354.0s)]
*  He sounds reedy. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3356.0s)]
*  His voice is thin. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3357.0s)]
*  He has a cough. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3358.0s)]
*  He's sick. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3359.0s)]
*  But it's passable. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3360.0s)]
*  And then comes I think it's his second answer in the first block in the first 10 minutes of the debate where he just completely loses his train of thought. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3363.0s)]
*  He's listing things that it's an economy question. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3371.0s)]
*  So he should be ready for it. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3375.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, you know, about third party groups in Bangladesh. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3376.0s)]
*  It was like, you know, relative inflation economy. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3380.0s)]
*  You know, that's going to be the first question we ask. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3383.0s)]
*  It's the number one issue on the minds of the voters. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3385.0s)]
*  And he just completely loses his train of thought. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3387.0s)]
*  And he starts reaching for, you know, grab back terms, the things that I've done for people, this, that, this, that. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3390.0s)]
*  And it's painful. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3396.0s)]
*  And and he and he closes with we finally beat Medicare. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3398.0s)]
*  And I say and it's time is up and I say thank you, Mr. Trump or whatever. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3405.0s)]
*  And we had iPads, Dana and I, so we could communicate with the control room because obviously we can't talk. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3409.0s)]
*  But, you know, who know? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3418.0s)]
*  We didn't know what was going to happen and who knows what we needed to communicate anyway. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3419.0s)]
*  I just wrote on the iPad. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3423.0s)]
*  I wrote a holy smokes because I kept it clean. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3425.0s)]
*  You know me very that I probably would have said something else. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3427.0s)]
*  But I didn't know who was in the control room for all I knew my version of this in my family as I was charged with watching our daughter. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3429.0s)]
*  So Nellie could watch the debate because I think she was writing her column TGIF the next day. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3435.0s)]
*  And I was just hearing like screaming like a banshee from the other room. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3440.0s)]
*  She was like, you are not going to fucking believe what I am seeing right now. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3444.0s)]
*  That's what holy smokes meant. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3447.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was that was that's the translation into Nellie of what I was thinking. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3449.0s)]
*  And then Dana passed me a note saying he just lost the election. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3455.0s)]
*  So it was pretty it was pretty obvious. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3460.0s)]
*  And then, you know, it wasn't just one bad answer. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3462.0s)]
*  He had several awful, awful answers. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3465.0s)]
*  I would say that there were two the rape by the sisters. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3468.0s)]
*  One was very crazy. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3471.0s)]
*  But and that and by the way, the that subject abortion rights is a subject that any Democratic presidential nominee should have been chopping at the bit. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3473.0s)]
*  And that should have been a homerun or grand slam. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3482.0s)]
*  Like you're in Georgia. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3484.0s)]
*  They're passing laws that you would argue are draconian. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3486.0s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump did. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3489.0s)]
*  He got rid of Roe v. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3490.0s)]
*  Wade. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3491.0s)]
*  This is the least popular thing about Donald Trump. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3492.0s)]
*  You know, teed up right there. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3495.0s)]
*  Take a take a whack. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3497.0s)]
*  First of all, he starts talking about the murder of Lakin Riley, which is why would you bring up the. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3499.0s)]
*  Worst possible thing for you for you, like an undocumented immigrant who came into the country while you were president murdering an innocent girl, an innocent woman. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3502.0s)]
*  And then and then he just he can't even give a cohesive, coherent answer on abortion rights. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3512.0s)]
*  But I forget there were just so many that were just so bad. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3519.0s)]
*  What was maybe as astonishing as what we all watched that night was the spin that at least for a time, maybe two or three weeks, it ended up being that the White House and the people around Biden attempted. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3524.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3538.0s)]
*  The idea that he had a cold, he had a cold. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3539.0s)]
*  He was over prepared. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3541.0s)]
*  He was over prepared. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3543.0s)]
*  He had a cold. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3544.0s)]
*  Were you astonished to watch that? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3545.0s)]
*  To watch that spin, even given what we all had seen? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3548.0s)]
*  No, because, you know, I had I had long sort of called their entire sort of calm strategy when it came to the age is like these are not the droids you're looking for. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3551.0s)]
*  That, you know, if if you say it's a good reference for a young guy, if you're going to be I'm a nerd. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3562.0s)]
*  So if you're going to, you know, I would, you know, I could go to them and I'd be like, you know, I'm going to report the sky is blue. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3568.0s)]
*  It's green. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3575.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like that was. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3576.0s)]
*  And so for them to I mean, this is a White House that instead of ever acknowledging ever that maybe he was like a little slower or like it like lost a step. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3578.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3588.0s)]
*  And mentally, they insisted to the very end that he was as sharp as ever. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3589.0s)]
*  Running circles around them. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3594.0s)]
*  I mean, just really unbelievable claims. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3595.0s)]
*  And one of the things that actually hasn't gotten much coverage from our book that I was really stunned is to learn was so the initial spin was, oh, our focus groups show that people hate Trump. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3600.0s)]
*  And yeah, you know, this wasn't a great debate for us. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3614.0s)]
*  But basically, it was a wash. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3617.0s)]
*  And people really didn't like Trump's answer on January 6 and blah, blah, blah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3619.0s)]
*  What they did not tell people as they were telling them this spin strategy about this focus group is that this focus group was stacked with people who did not like Donald Trump. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3624.0s)]
*  These were, for the most part, Biden voters that he was losing because of his age and because of inflation. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3637.0s)]
*  So as one pollster put it to us, no shit, they didn't like Trump. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3643.0s)]
*  They didn't vote like 80 percent of them hadn't voted for Trump ever. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3648.0s)]
*  But the idea that this was not some focus group of like undecided voters left, right, center. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3651.0s)]
*  This was a focus group of Biden voters that he needed to win back. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3656.0s)]
*  And they thought he was a disaster. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3661.0s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't like Trump. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3663.0s)]
*  But it was just it was such a dishonest spin. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3664.0s)]
*  But they just did the best with what they had. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3668.0s)]
*  Given the high drama of the book, it's sort of a strange anticlimax of what the three weeks after the debate were before the president dropped out. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3670.0s)]
*  Can you just talk a little bit about that period? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3681.0s)]
*  Because Chuck Schumer in the book kind of paints himself as like the hero that makes this pilgrimage to Rehoboth and finally speaks truth to power in the presidency. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3684.0s)]
*  And you're kind of like, where have you been the entire time? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3693.0s)]
*  And he is the only one that we can find that actually tells the president not to run. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3695.0s)]
*  He's the only one out of everybody. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3699.0s)]
*  Obama, Pelosi, Jeffries, Katzenberg. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3701.0s)]
*  I mean, other than Clooney and Top Ed, he's the only one that says it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3704.0s)]
*  What finally made the president decide not to run? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3708.0s)]
*  It was a combination of things. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3713.0s)]
*  One, you know, their answer is he didn't want to he didn't want to further divide the party and that he knew that maybe he could probably get the nomination. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3717.0s)]
*  But it would be ugly and he'd be limping into the election. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3728.0s)]
*  I think catching covid, which he did after three weeks and then being sort of isolated in his beach house and Rehoboth and really sick, really sick. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3732.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're 81 and you have covid, it's serious. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3745.0s)]
*  I do think Chuck Schumer making it so blunt and telling him that the vast majority of the senators think he thought he should not be the nominee. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3748.0s)]
*  Joe Biden had been in that body for 36 years. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3758.0s)]
*  I think that meant something to him. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3760.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, I think Chuck Schumer and other people like Minyamore and some other operatives had made the case that there is another path and that they didn't believe that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3763.0s)]
*  That he could win anymore. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3778.0s)]
*  I think I also think there might be some stuff we still don't know yet, but those are the reasons. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3780.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3787.0s)]
*  I don't know. I just think I mean, we're we think of this as the first draft, not the last draft. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3788.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to add stuff to the paperback. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3794.0s)]
*  So defunct. Well, because because I the reason why I say that is because he clearly still thinks he could have won. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3796.0s)]
*  He still clearly thinks that it was a winnable race. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3803.0s)]
*  And if you believe that and you think Donald Trump is a sexual threat, so why do you ultimately drop out? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3808.0s)]
*  Was it just the covid? I mean, I don't know. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3815.0s)]
*  It just or was it that he has metastatic prostate cancer? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3817.0s)]
*  I wasn't speculating that. But I mean, I'll be OK. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3822.0s)]
*  But that's just a perfect transition, which is in the day or two before your book comes out. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3825.0s)]
*  Oh, what do you know? The Biden family comes out with the news that he has very advanced stage four, which is very advanced prostate cancer. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3830.0s)]
*  And you have people even, you know, die hard liberal Democrats like Zeke Emanuel going on television shows like Morning Joe. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3840.0s)]
*  Hardly, you know, Biden critics talking about how it would be impossible for the president to have developed this in the few months since Trump won the election, that at the very least he would have had this for five, maybe even ten years. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3849.0s)]
*  Do you think that it's that they lied to us about his cancer? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3864.0s)]
*  We don't have any reporting to suggest that it's anything other than how the family presented it, which is diagnosed on Friday announced on Sunday. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3869.0s)]
*  But in the days before this book came out, I certainly understand why people are skeptical. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3877.0s)]
*  And we heard from people from Biden world, people who work in the Biden White House who share your obvious skepticism. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3882.0s)]
*  We just don't have any reporting suggesting it. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3890.0s)]
*  I will say that the announcement underscored something that Alex and I encountered while writing the book and also I think is one of the overlays of why the media wasn't as aggressive as the media was. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3893.0s)]
*  And it wasn't as aggressive as it could have, which is these are the most sensitive topics. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3906.0s)]
*  These are the most personal subjects. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3911.0s)]
*  And while we as Americans, I think, and Alex thinks we think that presidents should have to disclose everything, every medication they're on, the result of every test, etc. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3914.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3927.0s)]
*  There's also just a a sympathy that any president in engenders when it comes to his most personal, his or her most personal health details. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3929.0s)]
*  And also, it also underlines the complete opaqueness of all of this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3940.0s)]
*  We don't know anything other than what we're told. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3945.0s)]
*  This is the greatest democracy in the world. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3948.0s)]
*  And we're relying on the honor system for our world leaders to, like, tell us what infirmaries they may have. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3950.0s)]
*  Is it possible that Joe Biden really hasn't had a PSA test since 2014? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3958.0s)]
*  I guess. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3962.0s)]
*  I mean, I understand that that's the test relevant to the press. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3963.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they say that after age of 70, some people don't recommend it because of all the false positives. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3966.0s)]
*  But that's just for the average Joe. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3973.0s)]
*  Not no pun intended. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3975.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're running for president or being president, one thing like even if it's a false positive, you want to know. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3976.0s)]
*  And it's a blood test, right? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3982.0s)]
*  It's not like a prostate exam. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3983.0s)]
*  It's a blood test. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3985.0s)]
*  It's very simple. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3986.0s)]
*  So I don't know what to believe, honestly. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3987.0s)]
*  But I will say that we don't have any reporting to suggest that it's other anything other than how the family presented. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3990.0s)]
*  We still don't know if the president was suffering from dementia or some kind of Parkinson's. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=3996.0s)]
*  Do you think ultimately we'll know the truth of everything that he has been every malady? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4002.0s)]
*  I don't know in part because the one thing the cog, the lack of a cognitive test, which is like a simple 15 minute test. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4008.0s)]
*  Trump did one when he was in his first term. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4017.0s)]
*  We all recall. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4019.0s)]
*  Yes. Cow, pig, blue. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4020.0s)]
*  I think he just did another one, too. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4022.0s)]
*  He did just do another one. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4023.0s)]
*  And they usually recommend them for over 65. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4024.0s)]
*  The doctor basically said, I'm with him most days. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4026.0s)]
*  You know, those tests are only for people that see him every once in a while. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4030.0s)]
*  And look, if you look at if you want to see a cognitive test, look, he's already doing the job. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4033.0s)]
*  But we talked to doctors that also felt that the reason not to do one is because you don't want to know the the you don't want to know the result. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4038.0s)]
*  And so, you know, and also with all these things like diagnoses, you know, they I mean, if they don't diagnose it, then it's hard to ever know. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4046.0s)]
*  We talked to a number of neurologists who would not go on the record, but allowed us to say top neurologist or whatever. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4057.0s)]
*  And throughout 2024, there was a text chain with some of the top neurologists in the country just talking about what they were seeing with Biden in 2024. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4065.0s)]
*  And they all had their theories. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4074.0s)]
*  Is it Lewy body dementia? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4078.0s)]
*  Is it Parkinson's disease? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4080.0s)]
*  Is it you know, they all agreed that there were Parkinsonian symptoms, but nobody knew exactly what it was after the debate. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4083.0s)]
*  They're all like, well, here it is. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4089.0s)]
*  I mean, there's something going on. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4090.0s)]
*  We're not we're not making it up. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4093.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's also this tradition since the campaign of Barry Goldwater in 1964 that physicians generally speaking don't feel comfortable making diagnoses from afar. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4096.0s)]
*  If you had spent a lot of time looking at the kind of memes that are not memes, but clips that are served up on right wing Twitter accounts or you read conservative outlets, you weren't entirely shocked by what you saw on television that night. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4104.0s)]
*  And Alex, perhaps you weren't either because this was your specific beat. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4121.0s)]
*  The thing that was fascinating just from a sociological perspective for me and really everyone, I think, to watch was what the the Duke scholar Timor Kuran, who has this incredible book called I think Private Selves Public Lies, calls a preference cascade, which is like a moment happens where the permission structure is sort of granted. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4124.0s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, people who were scared to say, hey, I'm seeing this thing, I'm seeing that the sky is blue, but everyone else is saying it's green. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4145.0s)]
*  So I'm going to pretend it's green. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4154.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're able to say it's blue and watching that sort of cascade happen across CNN, MSNBC throughout like the entire sort of talking heads class was really interesting to watch. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4155.0s)]
*  And I wondered how you guys experienced that, because it felt like a little bit. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4168.0s)]
*  It felt like a moment where it was like, oh, the emperor has no clothes. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4173.0s)]
*  And now we can all say it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4176.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4177.0s)]
*  But it left, I think a lot of people wondering, well, hold on. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4178.0s)]
*  We've known that the emperor's had no clothes. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4181.0s)]
*  So why are we only now able to say it? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4183.0s)]
*  I would love for you to just reflect on that. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4186.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4187.0s)]
*  I mean, well, it's why if you're like a conservative or independent that was like, I'm seeing this. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4188.0s)]
*  Why isn't it being reflected in some legacy mainstream media? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4192.0s)]
*  I would get why you're like frustrated and be frustrated also with the sort of in some ways like overcorrection, like one example of overcorrection that I just remember was you may remember there was this this time story about the the Parkinson's specialist that visited the White House a bunch of times. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4197.0s)]
*  And I got a lot of attention. And this was after the debate. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4215.0s)]
*  But that information was already in the health report, like that the public health report that the doctor had issued, like they he said we had we had someone look at him for Parkinson's because he was old and he had a shuffle. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4218.0s)]
*  But that was never, you know, it was just sort of an example of sort of the like the stampede to your point of like, oh, now we're definitely covering this. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4233.0s)]
*  I also think, you know, the and I think some of the mainstream would be like, well, we there was a lot of coverage of the age and there was but only in the context of it as a political liability that it was much more horse race coverage. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4241.0s)]
*  Right. That like this is something he has to overcome. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4257.0s)]
*  So this is the strategy to overcome it. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4259.0s)]
*  There was not as much investigative work and reporting about what his age meant for his ability to do the job. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4260.0s)]
*  One of the stories that did come out about it. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4267.0s)]
*  You guys will remember the month better than I can. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4270.0s)]
*  It was in twenty twenty four was in the Wall Street Journal. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4273.0s)]
*  It was June twenty twenty four before the debate before the debate. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4275.0s)]
*  And the way that those two reporters were smeared was like I think in the same way that cancellations are not necessarily about the person being canceled. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4278.0s)]
*  They're about sending a sign to everyone else watching that this is going to happen to you if you step out of line. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4289.0s)]
*  I think that that dynamic was extraordinarily powerful in the press corps inside the legacy press. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4294.0s)]
*  You're going to lose your acts like if you are someone for whom that access is the way you get your stories and it's important to you to stay in good order among your colleagues. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4302.0s)]
*  Well, look what's going to happen to you. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4312.0s)]
*  They're going to call you a right wing hack and say that you're only I think they had to quote Mike Johnson in the piece because none of the actual Democrats would go on the record. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4314.0s)]
*  How important do you think that signal was? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4322.0s)]
*  Alex, you're someone who in your reporting for Axios did go against the herd and you were someone that was I don't want to say necessarily smeared. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4325.0s)]
*  You'll be the judge of whether or not you were smeared but roundly criticized by your colleagues for going for being curious about the wrong things. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4335.0s)]
*  How difficult was it? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4341.0s)]
*  Do you think for people to go against the herd? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4343.0s)]
*  You know, I think your diagnosis of sort of what was happening is much more is much more on target than a lot of what sort of I guess you like right wing or independent other independent conservative media, which is that, you know, they believe that it's all liberal media and there's like much more of an ideological mission. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4346.0s)]
*  You know, like United Conspiracy. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4368.0s)]
*  And I do think in some cases, some reporters left their ideological leanings like affect their reporting but I do agree that sort of, I think the group think that sets in among Washington and the self reinforcing and the, and the intimidation by the White House, and by feeling like you're ostracized not just by potential sources and potentially losing access but also by like your peers and colleagues. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4371.0s)]
*  Who are like giving you side eye. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4398.0s)]
*  I do think it's like, I mean, listen, I, it was, I mean, it made me doubt myself. Right. I mean, I wasn't making it up like sources were telling me that he was struggling. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4400.0s)]
*  So I, how did it make tell me more about that? How did it make you doubt yourself? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4409.0s)]
*  Well, because I mean, if you're on a limb, you're like, why is no one following? I mean, some people did follow. It wasn't, it wasn't just me like New York Times. I started booking you. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4413.0s)]
*  That's true. Like Jake, I mean, like Jake started booking me and CNN telling CNN that CNN should hire me and have me on more because he was fearless. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4421.0s)]
*  Peter, you know, Peter Baker did some like, and, and few others there's all and comes to mind. I'm sure I'm missing names like did build upon it. But yeah, I mean, like I was like, you know, on on a limb and like you, of course, like I think any journalist you're like, you want to you, you're, you're checking yourself. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4428.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, sometimes it was like, sometimes it was a bit lonely, but I think it was also just like, I was being told it. I believe my sources. And so it was like, but isn't it even more basic than that? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4447.0s)]
*  Isn't it? Isn't it just you are watching a per all of us know a grandparent or a person in our lives who we've loved that has aged all it took? Like, I think one of the things that is kind of baffling about this story is it's so much about in the end group thinking cowardice because normal ordinary Americans who will watch the clip of him. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4461.0s)]
*  You remember when he was in the field with Georgia Maloney and those other people and he's sort of stumbling doesn't know where to go or being on the stage with George Clooney and Obama and clearly not knowing where to go. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4485.0s)]
*  I think it was the George Clooney fundraiser. No Clooney was on stage at that moment. Anyone can watch those 15 second clips. They don't need any sources in Washington to know that person is infirm and certainly not capable of being the president of the United States. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4494.0s)]
*  I mean, the voters were clearly way ahead. I mean, there's an old phrase I think Gary Hart used to say, which is Washington's always the last to get the news. And like the voters were way ahead, certainly way ahead of Democratic elites and Democratic lawmakers. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4510.0s)]
*  They were definitely ahead of a lot in the media. I will say, though, I've heard this where it's like, well, it was like a cover up in plain sight. And there is something to that. But I also would say that. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4523.0s)]
*  Do you think that's true that it was a cover up in plain sight? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4535.0s)]
*  I think there is something to that. But our reporting and I think you'll see our reporting is that I mean, there's a reason why the debate was still so shocking. Like even to Nellie, who you said was like early on this, right? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4537.0s)]
*  It was still shocking how bad it had gotten behind the scenes. It was shocking to the Trump people. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4548.0s)]
*  I think well, OK, I think two things about it were shocking. One, how bad it was plain like that. That's just like the text. But I think the meta text of why it was so shocking was all of the people that were waved off as conspiracy theorists, right wing fever swamp people were completely right. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4553.0s)]
*  They were 100 percent right. They were completely right. And the people who, you know, even now, you know, you still hope they're telling the truth. Like maybe we can trust some of what they say. They were this profoundly wrong. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4572.0s)]
*  I think that is like the deeper layer of the shock. Definitely. We all should in retrospect looking back on it have been much more easy, much more quick to label what we saw, what it seemed. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4585.0s)]
*  But I think there also was regardless of ideological issues, I think there was also just a reluctance to say he seems adult. He seems like maybe he can't do the job when you have the entire infrastructure of a political party saying, what are you talking about? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4599.0s)]
*  He seems fine to us and we have meetings with him. One of the stories in our in the book is when at the same time, around the same time that Annie Linsky and Siobhan Hughes, these great reporters with the Wall Street Journal, right around the time that they break their story and are [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4616.0s)]
*  And are garroted by the Democratic Party and by journalists and by media critics and by journalism professors and this whole industry of people who claim to be nonpartisan assessors of truth, but that I'm sure you, me and Alex would maybe go through the list and take issue with how much that's true. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4635.0s)]
*  You know, that was traumatizing for them. I mean, I'm putting it, I'm assessing it from from my point of view, but that had to have been traumatizing for them. At the same time that they are doing that report. And this is in the book. There's another reporter with a national outlet who is who is getting the same information behind the scenes. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4661.0s)]
*  He's a mess. He can't answer questions. He's losing train of thought. And Steve Rashadi, the Biden aide, calls this reporter and basically says, I'm in the meetings. He's great. And the message that this reporter gets is if you do this story, I'm going to go on the record and say you're a liar. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4676.0s)]
*  And this is a young reporter, youngish reporter who didn't feel confident enough to go forward. And I think that probably happened a lot more than we know. I'm not excusing it. I'm just saying that White House is intimidate people. Reporters are human. Reporters want to be able to have careers reporters. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4696.0s)]
*  Nobody likes being attacked. I mean, I spent the last look at Barry Weiss telling the saying nobody likes to be attacked. It's not pleasant. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4718.0s)]
*  I think people are going to hear this podcast and hopefully and I hope they do read this book and think to themselves. What else are they lying about? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4726.0s)]
*  They should. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4735.0s)]
*  Okay. What are the what are the stories that you feel the press has been studiously and curious about? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4736.0s)]
*  I've been in Biden world for like like I've got I mean, that's why I thought they were curious about this story, which is why I wrote the book. And I do sort of agree like, you know, there's lots of reasons for trust in press being low. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4743.0s)]
*  And some of it is like, you know, online polarization, some of its online, you know, fake news or disinformation, whichever word you want to use. But I do think that like, you know, we bear some like we should also look inward. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4758.0s)]
*  We don't just self-flagellate about it, but we should also like. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4771.0s)]
*  But like speaking speaking of fake news and misinformation, you'll remember that days before the catastrophic debate that we've been talking about, the New York Times came out with a story labeling that the clips of Biden looking sort of lost and disoriented. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4774.0s)]
*  This was a news story. Were cheap fakes. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4791.0s)]
*  I have a good I have a good story about this. So when we were reporting the book, I remember talking to a fairly senior White House person and they were like they basically made it like, yes, he was bad. Yes, we shouldn't have run him again. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4794.0s)]
*  Yes, like he was really struggling. But they they sort of got my face. They were like, you you guys like bought our like bought some of our spin and they specifically mentioned that cheap fake stuff. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4805.0s)]
*  They were like, we this person was like we could not at least they were speaking for themselves. They were like, I could not believe we got those stories placed. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4818.0s)]
*  But this is where I think that the cover up is maybe cover up is the wrong word. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4827.0s)]
*  But the. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4833.0s)]
*  You could write a whole book. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4834.0s)]
*  Pandemic of silence and in curiosity in the press is maybe the main actor in the story. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4835.0s)]
*  Because it is our job to distrust. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4841.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4844.0s)]
*  Politicians spin. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4845.0s)]
*  So it's a different book, though, to your point. I know maybe it's the one you'll do next. So so the cheap fake thing is so fascinating to me. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4846.0s)]
*  And we it's it's just we mentioned it very briefly. We the book just for full disclosure, we wanted the book to come out in May. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4852.0s)]
*  Like we had we pitched it in November after the election. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4861.0s)]
*  And it was the pitch was we want to hand in a first draft in three months and spend a month and a half editing and fact checking. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4865.0s)]
*  We want it out in May. And there were publishers that said, well, we can do June. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4872.0s)]
*  And we said, I'm sorry, that's not soon enough. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4875.0s)]
*  And in order to meet that production schedule, the book had to be eighty five thousand words, which I think as a writer, you'll appreciate. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4878.0s)]
*  I actually think made it a better book and made it a more readable book. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4883.0s)]
*  But that said, there were things that we had a lot more on that we that we just didn't have space for. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4886.0s)]
*  We just had to make choices. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4892.0s)]
*  Cheap fakes is such an interesting topic. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4895.0s)]
*  Cheap fakes is a term that this Harvard professor or expert on misinformation came up with as a play on deepfakes. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4897.0s)]
*  We all know what deepfakes are using technology to make it look as though Barry Weiss is saying something she would never say through technology. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4906.0s)]
*  Cheap fakes is it's too cute by half the term. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4914.0s)]
*  It's just meant as a play on deepfakes because it's not using technology. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4918.0s)]
*  It's just like editing. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4922.0s)]
*  So, for example, Joe Biden at the anniversary of Normandy is sitting down and they're announcing Lloyd Austin and he freezes in place. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4924.0s)]
*  And why does he freeze in place? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4936.0s)]
*  He freezes in place because it is a huge effort for this man to sit down. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4938.0s)]
*  It is a huge effort for this man to stand up. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4944.0s)]
*  So he just freezes in place until they're done introducing Lloyd Austin and then he sits down. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4947.0s)]
*  The clip is him just freezing without him sitting down. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4952.0s)]
*  It is a clip of something weird. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4958.0s)]
*  It is a clip of a man who is enfeebled. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4961.0s)]
*  It is not a clip of a man freezing for no reason. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4965.0s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why the White House was able to get some reporters, and I would say not me and not Alex, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4969.0s)]
*  some reporters to buy this cheap fake thing is because there were edits that were that they were able to use to say, look, it's not even real or it's not fair. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4978.0s)]
*  When he's wandering off at the G7 in Italy, he is wandering towards a bunch of paratroopers. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4989.0s)]
*  That does not make the moment any less weird. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=4997.0s)]
*  It is still strange and it is still him wandering off and it's still Prime Minister Maloney bringing him back. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5000.0s)]
*  But the edit of not showing that he's actually walking towards something, a paratrooper, allowed the White House to successfully tell some reporters. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5006.0s)]
*  I'm not defending the White House here. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5016.0s)]
*  I just want people to understand. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5018.0s)]
*  I'm not defending it, but I'm saying having that edit where it was allowed them to sell to Washington Post, New York Times, other newspapers. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5019.0s)]
*  I believe those two papers. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5030.0s)]
*  I might be wrong, but some mainstream organizations, the idea that these are cheap fakes. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5031.0s)]
*  Now, I didn't think so. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5036.0s)]
*  I thought that they were edited, but they were weird moments regardless. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5037.0s)]
*  But I think that that is that is part of the story of a gullible press and the White House taking advantage of edits that didn't need to be made to make an argument that went way too far in the White House's direction to the point that even White House people were telling Alex, I can't believe you bought it. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5044.0s)]
*  The backlash that I'm seeing is largely coming. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5067.0s)]
*  I don't go in blue sky. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5069.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's happening there, too. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5070.0s)]
*  I had to get off on October 8th, 2023 for obvious reasons. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5072.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5075.0s)]
*  So a lot of what I'm seeing, Jake, is not directed at Alex, who has been reporting on this. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5076.0s)]
*  I would say of all. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5081.0s)]
*  Well, I'm seeing some nasty stuff about Alex. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5083.0s)]
*  I'll share it with you later. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5085.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5086.0s)]
*  Well, but I would say it's largely focused on you. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5087.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5090.0s)]
*  Perhaps because you have a huge show on CNN every night. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5091.0s)]
*  Perhaps because they've read Alex's wonderful reporting and actually who knows the reason. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5095.0s)]
*  But it's it's more focused on you. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5099.0s)]
*  And there are some specific clips that are getting circulated a lot, specifically one where Laura Trump is on your show. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5101.0s)]
*  You'll remember the time better than I will. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5108.0s)]
*  October 2020. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5110.0s)]
*  It was four and a half years ago. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5111.0s)]
*  And she basically suggests what the reporting in this book suggests, that she's looking at an enfeebled president who's not fully compas mentis. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5113.0s)]
*  And you sort of glibly dismiss her. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5123.0s)]
*  And I wondered if you could reflect on that a little bit. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5124.0s)]
*  Sure. I mean, you know, you called her and everything. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5127.0s)]
*  But but who do you when you're watching that clip? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5130.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5132.0s)]
*  I what version of yourself do you see? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5133.0s)]
*  I see. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5135.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't want to make excuses for it. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5136.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5138.0s)]
*  I mean, we live on TV and so we die on TV. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5139.0s)]
*  So things that we say and and age well or age poorly and that age poorly. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5141.0s)]
*  I see somebody who is interviewing a member of the Trump family right before an election. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5148.0s)]
*  And I think that Joe Biden is old, but I do not have reporting suggesting that he is in cognitive decline. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5155.0s)]
*  And I know that I have been shocked by the things that members of the Trump family are saying about President Biden and Vice President Biden. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5163.0s)]
*  Don Jr. is out there calling like literally suggesting he's a pedophile on Instagram and such. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5173.0s)]
*  And, you know, I I didn't think much of what she was saying and and she was right and I was wrong. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5179.0s)]
*  But, I mean, I think that there is a big, big difference between the Joe Biden of 2020 and the Joe Biden of 2024 as our as our reporting bears out. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5186.0s)]
*  And there's also a big, big difference between what I am saying now, looking back on it, having reported this book and the information she had. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5196.0s)]
*  Although, again, our reporting suggests that there were moments of cognitive impairment that he was having this far back as 2015. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5206.0s)]
*  I would also say in terms of what I have discussed in terms of my reflection on this just in the last couple of weeks, some of those clips that you mentioned, the large Trump one is totally fair. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5212.0s)]
*  That's fine. It's it's it's accurate. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5225.0s)]
*  I said it. I did it. I own it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5228.0s)]
*  But some of the clips are just they're deceptively edited. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5230.0s)]
*  I'm not going to call them cheap fakes, but but they are me saying what The Washington Post is accusing somebody of doing. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5233.0s)]
*  And they edit out me citing The Washington Post. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5241.0s)]
*  Or it's me interviewing Frank for about his book and making it sound as though I am saying what I am paraphrasing Frank for saying and on and on. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5244.0s)]
*  There is there is these there are deceptive clips there and whatever. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5254.0s)]
*  This is the world that we're in. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5257.0s)]
*  But I will say when the publicist for the book went to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, Fox, when I reached out to a Republican senator who all used these clips without even researching them or anything like that and said these aren't these are out of context. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5259.0s)]
*  They were not greeted with the response of, oh, I'm so sorry. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5280.0s)]
*  I'll correct the record or that's not true. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5289.0s)]
*  Or let me let me see what the reality is. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5291.0s)]
*  They don't care. They ignore it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5293.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter. Moving on. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5295.0s)]
*  And so I'm OK reflecting and looking back and saying, I wish I'd done this better. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5296.0s)]
*  I wish I'd been more aggressive. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5302.0s)]
*  I were, you know, what Laura Trump said turned out to be accurate based on my reporting. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5303.0s)]
*  And here is our book showing this reporting. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5308.0s)]
*  And I think this book is important. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5310.0s)]
*  And I think this book, the reason why this book is getting attention is because airing those clips and making fun of President Biden is not actually reporting. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5312.0s)]
*  It's commentary and it's fine. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5322.0s)]
*  And I'm not criticizing it. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5323.0s)]
*  But what we do in this book is actually show what was going on behind the scenes. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5324.0s)]
*  But I'm fine being the person that reflects and says, you know, I got that wrong or I could have done that better in contrast to these critics who in the name of media criticism are being untruthful and don't care. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5328.0s)]
*  But would you say that looking back at the body of your work over the past during during the Biden White House that you could have brought a level of skepticism, scrutiny and curiosity to the story? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5343.0s)]
*  I think this story, I mean, of course, I don't think there's any there are very few members of the legacy media that I couldn't that I don't think could say that. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5357.0s)]
*  But I will say that in October 2020, I interviewed Joe Biden and I asked if he would take a pledge to be transparent about his health. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5363.0s)]
*  And in October 2022, the only time I had an interview with him during his presidency, I pointed out that the American people think he's too old. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5371.0s)]
*  Whenever he's asked about that, he says, watch me. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5382.0s)]
*  They're watching him. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5383.0s)]
*  They still think that. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5384.0s)]
*  I had skeptical interviews with Kareem Jean-Pierre in 2023. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5385.0s)]
*  And after Kate, after the her report, I had Kate Bedingfield come on the show and I was not Robert Herb basher. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5390.0s)]
*  I completely thought that he was accurate and I didn't understand what I was seeing from the White House or from other journalists that didn't see what we were all seeing. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5400.0s)]
*  So I think that there is reporting that I'm proud of that are also that is also part of the record. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5410.0s)]
*  But on the whole, I wish we had broke. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5417.0s)]
*  I wish these 200 sources had talked to us two years ago and I wish I'd known what I know now. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5420.0s)]
*  I would not say I was in curious. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5426.0s)]
*  I would say that I was one of the many people who was asking about this and was lied to over and over and over. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5427.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just you have to remember the Biden people were not only lying to the press and they were not only lying to the public. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5435.0s)]
*  They were lying to donors. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5441.0s)]
*  They were lying to their cabinet secretaries. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5443.0s)]
*  They were lying to Democratic members of Congress. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5445.0s)]
*  A cover up. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5448.0s)]
*  And like I said, this was almost a successful one, even though we all saw him aging. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5449.0s)]
*  We didn't know he was. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5453.0s)]
*  You know, he had these moments of of non-functioning suggests that there's a lot of people in on something. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5455.0s)]
*  And whether they were doing it because they believed it or they had been told it, I'd still at the end of the day for all the criticism of the media that I'm not pushing back on that I agree with. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5461.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, the Democrats did this. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5474.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, the Biden family and the Politburo did this. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5477.0s)]
*  And yes, there were those of us who should have pushed back more. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5482.0s)]
*  But if you can't get any official to tell you it's really bad behind the scenes, let me tell you how bad it is. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5486.0s)]
*  I don't know what more we could have done. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5495.0s)]
*  And I wish that those people had been more willing to talk to the press. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5500.0s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about the disincentive structure to speak out in the summer of it was twenty twenty three. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5504.0s)]
*  I was at a dinner. There were a lot of wealthy Democratic bundlers, donors, lots of people in the kind of class that you're talking about that were lied to. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5510.0s)]
*  And, you know, like many of these dinners, I was sort of called on to like be the dancing monkey and share my thoughts on the upcoming election. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5520.0s)]
*  And I said something that I did not consider controversial at the time, which is that I thought Biden was way too old to be president. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5527.0s)]
*  And it was like I had taken a shit in the middle of the dinner table. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5536.0s)]
*  There's a bit. Yeah, sorry. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5541.0s)]
*  It was like I had to tell you of newborns. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5543.0s)]
*  Yes. That's my entire life. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5545.0s)]
*  It was I'll give another. It was like I had said something completely unacceptable. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5547.0s)]
*  OK. And the first metaphor. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5552.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. Thank you. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5554.0s)]
*  And I sat down and I was like, what did I do something wrong? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5556.0s)]
*  Like in the circles that I talk in and travel in, this was completely commonsensical. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5559.0s)]
*  They were thinking, oh, so you want Trump to be elected? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5564.0s)]
*  But I sat down and the dinner companion seated to my right proceeded to tell me a story of the president not recognizing him, not remembering his name. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5567.0s)]
*  Yeah. Even though his public reaction, 10 seconds before had been astonishment. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5576.0s)]
*  What is reporting this story? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5583.0s)]
*  How is it shifted your view of of human nature and of and of the sense that to some extent we are more sheep like than we would imagine ourselves to be? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5585.0s)]
*  Well, I also say like or did you have a tragic view of human nature to begin with? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5595.0s)]
*  I think I think we're both more cynical today than we were when we started the project. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5599.0s)]
*  Both of us. Yeah, that is that is true. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5604.0s)]
*  I also think, you know, I think sometimes if you believe you're on the side of like if you believe you're on the side of righteousness, I think sometimes it can make you even like rationalize things even more. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5606.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of these people, you know, believed in their good intentions to the point that they were willing to like excuse and dismiss and and rationalize things. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5626.0s)]
*  And also, to your point, it's like like they all acted like shocked, but they all knew it was true. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5640.0s)]
*  And because they had seen it. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5648.0s)]
*  But my feeling at this dinner was hold on the people around this table could make a collect. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5650.0s)]
*  It was like a collective action problem. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5656.0s)]
*  They all knew what I was saying was true based on the little anecdotes I then heard in private throughout the night. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5658.0s)]
*  But they were disincentivized from saying that the sky was blue. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5664.0s)]
*  And if they had all made a choice literally that night to say, you know what, we're not going to actually give more money to Jeffrey Katzenberger, whatever Bundler was coming their way. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5670.0s)]
*  We're going to collectively speak out about this. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5679.0s)]
*  There's plenty of time for a primary. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5682.0s)]
*  Why do you think in retrospect that didn't happen? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5684.0s)]
*  Because privately, anyone that interacted with the president knew that if it wasn't total enfeeblement that he was too old to be the president. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5688.0s)]
*  I think that people are afraid. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5696.0s)]
*  That's really as simple as it is. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5700.0s)]
*  I mean, I've heard. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5702.0s)]
*  But help the ordinary person understand you're a billionaire. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5703.0s)]
*  You're a Democratic donor. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5706.0s)]
*  They have a private plane. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5707.0s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5708.0s)]
*  Access the president. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5709.0s)]
*  They don't want to lose what they have. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5710.0s)]
*  They don't want to lose the nice life that they have. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5713.0s)]
*  And they are afraid if they say the emperor has no clothes that will make them unpopular. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5716.0s)]
*  That will make them on the outs. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5722.0s)]
*  That will make them kicked off this board or that board or not invited to the White House or whatever. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5724.0s)]
*  And there is just a tremendous amount of fear. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5729.0s)]
*  I just heard I heard the other day some horrible story about the kid of a politician at a meal and restaurant and some pro-Palestinian protestor getting up into this kid's face like maybe the kids in her 20s and just yelling, yelling, yelling, yelling because of her dad. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5732.0s)]
*  And apparently went on for 20 minutes and nobody in the restaurant did anything. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5756.0s)]
*  Nobody in the restaurant said anything. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5761.0s)]
*  And I think that that is sadly human nature. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5764.0s)]
*  And I think it is not unexpected that so few people would do or say anything to risk what they have. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5769.0s)]
*  And again I just come back to I know that Siobhan and Annie at the Wall Street Journal are proud of their work and stand by it and would do it again. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5782.0s)]
*  But I also know it was unpleasant for them. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5793.0s)]
*  Very unpleasant for them. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5796.0s)]
*  And I also know that that story was not followed up. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5798.0s)]
*  With more stories. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5801.0s)]
*  With more stories. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5802.0s)]
*  I mean after the debate yes. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5803.0s)]
*  But before the debate no. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5804.0s)]
*  And you know it's just you see it in again I'm so glad that the response to this book Among the Normies is positive with people buying it in the reviews from the Times and the Post and the LA Times etc. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5806.0s)]
*  etc. being so positive. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5820.0s)]
*  But the personal shit that is coming my way and Alex's way I don't and again I'm not complaining about it. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5822.0s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5829.0s)]
*  This is the business we've chosen. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5831.0s)]
*  But I don't think it provides an incentive structure for other people to say oh I'm going to try to write a book like this revealing X about Trump or X about Chuck Schumer or whatever. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5833.0s)]
*  I think most people would probably just you know what I'm just going to keep my head down and do my job. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5846.0s)]
*  Why are there so few name sources in this book? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5850.0s)]
*  There are a lot of name sources. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5853.0s)]
*  But I hear what you're saying. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5854.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of name sources. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5856.0s)]
*  But you want to know who aid number one that said this is sure I want to know cabinet secretary number one. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5858.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5864.0s)]
*  Because they're they they don't want to go through you know half the shit that we're going through. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5865.0s)]
*  They don't want people calling them traitors. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5872.0s)]
*  They don't want to not be invited on the boards. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5874.0s)]
*  They don't want the Biden family to hate them. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5876.0s)]
*  They don't want to be smeared by Hunter Biden. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5878.0s)]
*  This is a scandal. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5883.0s)]
*  So why would you want your name associated with the scandal? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5884.0s)]
*  It would be painful to have your name in the short term associated with the scandal. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5888.0s)]
*  But if one of the upshots of this story but also the lab leak but also the BLM summer but also the school lockdown there have been so many stories that have decimated trust. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5892.0s)]
*  Let's just say in the progressive establishment in the Democratic Party. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5905.0s)]
*  Certainly in the legacy press and I would say that part of like if you want to win in the long term it would seem to me to be an essential step to have some kind of apology honest reckoning about what's happened in order to win again. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5911.0s)]
*  If you're trying to appeal to free press readers and viewers. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5927.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5932.0s)]
*  But if you're trying to appeal to the base of the Republican Party or the base of the Democratic Party I don't know that that's the case. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5933.0s)]
*  I mean one of the reasons I am so do you think that's the case for the press. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5939.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5942.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5943.0s)]
*  But one of the reasons for the press that doesn't have an incentive structure to only focus on Republicans or Democrats because that's that's important. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5944.0s)]
*  There are obviously business models not based on the free press business model of intellectual vigor and honesty. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5953.0s)]
*  There there are preaching to the choir business models. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5960.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5962.0s)]
*  They're very lucrative. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5963.0s)]
*  Yeah right. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5964.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5965.0s)]
*  A lot of money also in like anti-Semitic podcasts. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5966.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5968.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5969.0s)]
*  So tell me about it. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5970.0s)]
*  So so I think that one of the things that's been surprising is I would think since this book has not really been I mean like I think people just accept that our reporting is honest and true and fair and accurate. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5972.0s)]
*  I would think that there would be a Democratic 2028 or or whatever who would come out and say something along the lines of we have to be honest with the American people that we can't let that happen again. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=5991.0s)]
*  And you have seen glimmers of it from Congressman Ro Khanna. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6006.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy said something about obviously Joe Biden declined. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6010.0s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg something about obviously he shouldn't have run again. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6014.0s)]
*  People just dipping their toe in it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6017.0s)]
*  But we haven't really heard from Newsom or Whitmer or Shapiro or Warnock. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6019.0s)]
*  I mean there hasn't really been a what about what's in this book. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6023.0s)]
*  And you surprised. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6029.0s)]
*  I'm not because the it's it's the warm reception we got at the 92nd Street Y last night. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6031.0s)]
*  Notwithstanding I think that there are a lot of Democrats who still don't want to talk about this and still don't want to confront the fact that Joe Biden and his team were part of a cover up and a deception campaign that ended up delivering Donald Trump back to the White House. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6039.0s)]
*  I think they just don't want to accept it. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6057.0s)]
*  They want to blame me or they want to blame Maggie Haberman or they want to blame Trump or Fox or whatever. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6059.0s)]
*  But there there's no degree among the Democratic base to reckon with what they are part of. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6066.0s)]
*  And in fact for some of these resistance grifters the incentive structure is the opposite. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6073.0s)]
*  Joe Biden was the greatest president ever. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6082.0s)]
*  It's it's the it's the corporate media whores that are that drove him out etc. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6083.0s)]
*  I mean also they were part of it. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6088.0s)]
*  Like there's tape of I mean Chris Murphy did recently with this. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6090.0s)]
*  There's lots of tape of Chris Murphy saying he's as sharp as ever. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6093.0s)]
*  He's like very engaged. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6097.0s)]
*  There's leaders the Democratic Party who didn't see Biden as often but they they all went public and defended him. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6098.0s)]
*  And so I think that's also part of it too. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6106.0s)]
*  I think this is like what the Iraq you said this is the biggest scandal of the 21st century. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6108.0s)]
*  I would say political political. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6113.0s)]
*  I mean I think the Iraq War WMD. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6115.0s)]
*  But I would say that's policy. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6117.0s)]
*  OK. Fair fair. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6119.0s)]
*  I would say that that presidential scandal. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6120.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean I would say WMD was bigger just because of the death count and everything. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6122.0s)]
*  But it reminds me that's significant. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6125.0s)]
*  Although you know who knows what this meant. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6127.0s)]
*  Like it's you can't quantify like his atlant leading to this policy on the border led to this murder. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6130.0s)]
*  I mean you can't really do the math on that but it's not like there were no repercussions. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6135.0s)]
*  I meant more in the line of like Watergate or presidential scandals. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6138.0s)]
*  But I totally take your point. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6142.0s)]
*  Yeah I think this is like Iraq though. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6143.0s)]
*  I think in the sense that this is a burden that I think the party will have to reckon with one way or the other. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6145.0s)]
*  And whether that means you know the election of Obama you know several years later or the nomination of Donald Trump who you know is in Iraq or truth or really ultimately in 2016. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6151.0s)]
*  I don't know what the repercussions will be. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6163.0s)]
*  I just know me personally. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6165.0s)]
*  I don't understand how anyone can still be pretending that this is anything other than what it obviously is. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6167.0s)]
*  And if like you don't know because you haven't read the book then read the fucking book. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6174.0s)]
*  I mean like we put a lot of work into this. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6178.0s)]
*  This is not an agenda driven front project other than what happened. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6180.0s)]
*  What just happened. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6183.0s)]
*  Why did that happen. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6184.0s)]
*  Like we don't have any personal animosity towards any of the Bidens or Donnellan or Rashidi or any of these guys. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6185.0s)]
*  We just reported what we found. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6192.0s)]
*  Alex Thompson Jake Tapper. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6194.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6196.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6197.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKF_UarIdu0&t=6198.0s)]
