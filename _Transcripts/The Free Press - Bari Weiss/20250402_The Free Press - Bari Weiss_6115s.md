A few years ago Jay Bhattacharya was an obscure Stanford professor—a medical doctor who also had a PhD in economics. Then Covid hit, the lockdowns began, and “Doctor Jay”—as he is sometimes known—became a pariah in the medical community.

That’s because, along with colleagues from Harvard and Oxford, Jay questioned whether the lockdowns were a good idea. They did this in an open letter called the Great Barrington Declaration. And this idea, in the madness of that period, was considered so dangerous by federal health authorities and Big Tech that Jay was not only smeared, but censored. His work—from Reddit to Twitter to Facebook—was suppressed.

But here’s the thing: The lockdowns were pretty disastrous. We’re still dealing with their effects—and it’s still unclear if they were worth it.

The powers that be tried to shut Jay up, yet he persisted. And after surviving that ordeal, he is now the new head of the National Institutes of Health. If you’re skeptical of karma, this turn of events may lead you to believe in it.

# Jay Bhattacharya Was ‘Dangerous.’ Now He Leads the NIH.
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8)
*  From the Free Press, this is honestly an I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=0.0s)]
*  A few years ago, J. Bhattacharya was an obscure Stanford professor, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4.0s)]
*  a respected medical doctor who also had a PhD in economics. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=9.0s)]
*  He had published around 135 peer-reviewed papers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=13.0s)]
*  But then COVID hit, the lockdowns began, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=17.0s)]
*  and Dr. J., as he is sometimes known, became infamous. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=20.0s)]
*  He became a pariah in the medical community. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=24.0s)]
*  The idea of herd immunity made headlines again recently [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=27.0s)]
*  when three scientists put out what they called the Great Barrington Declaration. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=30.0s)]
*  Herd immunity was very elusive with COVID, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=33.0s)]
*  and the Great Barrington Declaration was flawed both conceptually and in practice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=36.0s)]
*  Trump's top candidate endorsed herd immunity [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=42.0s)]
*  as the best way to address the COVID pandemic, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=46.0s)]
*  just a fancy way of saying, let's get everybody sick and see what happens. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=49.0s)]
*  Along with colleagues from Harvard and Oxford, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=53.0s)]
*  J. questioned whether or not the lockdowns were a good idea, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=56.0s)]
*  whether or not the trade-offs were worthwhile. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=60.0s)]
*  He and his colleagues did this in an open letter called the Great Barrington Declaration, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=63.0s)]
*  and the ideas contained there, at least in the madness of that period, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=68.0s)]
*  were considered so dangerous by our public health authorities and by big tech [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=72.0s)]
*  that J. was not only smeared but censored. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=77.0s)]
*  His work, from Reddit to Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, was suppressed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=80.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. The lockdowns were pretty disastrous. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=85.0s)]
*  We're still dealing with their effects. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=90.0s)]
*  Effects like the loss of childhood learning, the cancer screenings that were skipped, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=92.0s)]
*  the inability of those with special needs or disabilities to see the people who helped them, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=97.0s)]
*  the separation of families, the people who died alone in hospitals, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=102.0s)]
*  just to name a few of the consequences. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=107.0s)]
*  And it's still unclear if those lockdowns were actually worth it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=110.0s)]
*  The powers-that-be tried to shut up J. Bhattacharya, but he wouldn't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=114.0s)]
*  And after surviving that ordeal, he is now the new head of the National Institutes of Health. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=119.0s)]
*  If you're someone that's skeptical of karma, this turn of events may lead you to believe in it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=127.0s)]
*  J. is leading this massive federal agency, the crown jewel of American science. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=132.0s)]
*  It is the largest public funder of medical research in the country [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=138.0s)]
*  at a moment when public health authorities desperately need to rebuild trust. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=141.0s)]
*  Here's another wrinkle. J. has two bosses, President Trump, who initiated Operation Warp Speed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=147.0s)]
*  to develop a COVID vaccine in his first term, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=154.0s)]
*  the Health and Human Services Secretary, who is also the most famous vaccine skeptic in America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=159.0s)]
*  Walking the line here will inevitably be tricky for Dr. J. How can he do it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=166.0s)]
*  How does someone who believes that vaccinating your kids for deadly diseases like polio and measles, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=171.0s)]
*  which he does believe, also confront the idea that large swaths of Americans right now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=177.0s)]
*  have a fear around vaccinating your kids? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=183.0s)]
*  That's among the many things I ask him in this conversation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=186.0s)]
*  J. has lived a remarkable life, and we talk about all of it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=190.0s)]
*  We talk about what it meant for him to become an American citizen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=193.0s)]
*  We talk about his conversion to Christianity as a teenager, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=196.0s)]
*  and how his faith not only allowed him to stick to his values, but even to pray for Francis Collins, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=200.0s)]
*  the old NIH director who called J.'s ideas dangerous and called him fringe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=206.0s)]
*  He says he's in favor of Biden pardoning Fauci, interestingly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=212.0s)]
*  He talks about wanting to create an open secret to expose the scientists who take money from Big Pharma. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=216.0s)]
*  We talk about the chutzpah, is a way to put it, that it took to fight the entire medical establishment, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=223.0s)]
*  and how he ultimately triumphed against his critics. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=230.0s)]
*  Most importantly, we talk about how he wants to put the National Institutes of Health [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=233.0s)]
*  on the front line in the war against chronic illness in America. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=238.0s)]
*  How can public health authorities make America healthy again? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=242.0s)]
*  More than that, how can they regain the trust and the authority needed to advance public health once more? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=246.0s)]
*  Today on Honestly, in his first interview, new NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=253.0s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=259.0s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya, welcome to Honestly, and thank you so much for giving us your first interview as head of the NIH. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=261.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me on, Barry. It is an absolute honor to talk with you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=271.0s)]
*  So, to remind people of who you are, I think your name will be familiar to anyone that's been listening to the show or reading the free press. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=275.0s)]
*  But big picture. Five years ago, because of your heterodox view about the proper way to mitigate the spread of COVID, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=284.0s)]
*  you were turned into an untouchable heretic, really, pariah in the scientific community. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=292.0s)]
*  And this was because of a concerted effort on the part of some of the most prominent people in the world of public health, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=300.0s)]
*  namely Francis Collins, the head of the NIH, who called you a fringe epidemiologist and called you dangerous. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=309.0s)]
*  Now, just a few days ago, you were confirmed to lead the NIH, the very institution that tried to turn you into an untouchable. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=317.0s)]
*  So I want to start by asking Jay Bhattacharya, do you believe in karma? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=326.0s)]
*  I believe in God, and he's really laughing at me. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=330.0s)]
*  It's been quite the journey. I mean, if you'd asked me five years ago, did I even have as an ambition to be the head of the NIH, I would have laughed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=335.0s)]
*  I loved being a professor. I still love thinking of myself as a teacher and researcher primarily. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=343.0s)]
*  But to have the chance to lead this institute, which I believe is the most important biomedical institute in the world, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=348.0s)]
*  that has played a tremendous role in the improvements in health we've seen over decades, it is such a great honor. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=355.0s)]
*  And it does feel a little karmic, doesn't it? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=363.0s)]
*  So I also read somewhere that what is your full name? Your full name is? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=366.0s)]
*  Jayanta Bhattacharya. Although my cousins, they say I don't know how to pronounce either my first name or my last name. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=372.0s)]
*  So what does Jayanta mean? Doesn't it also mean something fitting for this story? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=379.0s)]
*  I mean, it means one who will be victorious or one who I mean, it's like, yeah, it's like Nike in Greek or something. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=385.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. So we're going to talk about the NIH and your plans, what you want to do there, what you're planning to do there a little bit later in the conversation. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=393.0s)]
*  I want to start by just quickly reviewing your story to jog people's memory and perhaps for those who don't remember this at all, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=401.0s)]
*  because a lot of stuff that happened in COVID has been quickly forgotten or memory hold. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=409.0s)]
*  So four and a half years ago, you were a respected scientist at Stanford. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=414.0s)]
*  You had published something like 135 peer reviewed papers. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=418.0s)]
*  You were known as an expert in health economics, got a Ph.D. in economics. You went to medical school. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=422.0s)]
*  OK, now in that forward to October 2020, you and Sunetra Gupta of Oxford and Martin Kulldorf of Harvard, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=427.0s)]
*  you all came together to sort of question the consensus about the wisdom of lockdowns. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=436.0s)]
*  And you did this in a statement that was known as the Great Barrington Declaration. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=443.0s)]
*  I just want to read a paragraph to remind people of what it said. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=447.0s)]
*  Current lockdown policies, and this is in October of 2020 that you're writing this, are producing devastating effects on short and long term public health. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=450.0s)]
*  The results, to name a few, include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screening and deteriorating mental mental health, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=459.0s)]
*  leading to greater excess mortality in years to come with the working class and the younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=470.0s)]
*  Keeping students out of school, you wrote, is a grave injustice. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=478.0s)]
*  And I'll add just one more line. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=483.0s)]
*  Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=485.0s)]
*  Now, four days after you all put out this statement, the Great Barrington Declaration, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=494.0s)]
*  Francis Collins, who was the head of the NIH at the time, writes an email to Anthony Fauci, who was then the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=499.0s)]
*  And in that email, which people can go and Google and find it, he called you a fringe, the group of you, fringe epidemiologists, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=509.0s)]
*  and suggested that what was necessary was a quick and devastating takedown of the premises of the Great Barrington Declaration. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=517.0s)]
*  And then after this private email, which has since come to light, a few days later, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=525.0s)]
*  Francis Collins gives an interview to the Washington Post in which he says of your statement, this is not mainstream science. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=529.0s)]
*  It's dangerous. Try and go back four and a half years. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=537.0s)]
*  And I know a lot has happened since then. Why did Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci respond the way that they did? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=543.0s)]
*  I want you to steelman their approach. Why did they do this? Why was it? Why was that? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=550.0s)]
*  Why were the stakes so high? Why did you guys need to be discredited as dangerous? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=557.0s)]
*  Right. So four and a half years ago, October 2020, the first wave of covid was already behind us. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=563.0s)]
*  And many of the lockdowns that had been implemented in March of 2020, they played themselves out through the summer. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=571.0s)]
*  And many places it started to open open up. There were plans to reopen schools. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=579.0s)]
*  Many places did reopen schools, although a lot many, many, many also didn't like in California, for instance, my kids were out of school for two years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=585.0s)]
*  The public health community and I and Martin and Sunetra, everyone saw that the lockdowns had not that March, April lockdowns had not succeeded in getting rid of the virus. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=592.0s)]
*  That was very, very obvious that the virus was here to stay, that there was no technology we had then or now to actually eradicate the virus. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=603.0s)]
*  And so we so we but we also saw Martin, Sunetra and I that there was a desire to reinstitute the lockdowns in the fall. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=612.0s)]
*  Well, the idea that lockdowns were the way to manage a respiratory virus like covid had sort of established itself in sort of the lead among the leaders of the scientific community, including Francis Collins, including Tony Fauci and others. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=622.0s)]
*  But we also saw a couple of things. One is you read that statement that we wrote in the Great Branch Declaration. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=635.0s)]
*  There was evidence all around us already by then of the tremendous damage done to the poor, the working class, the children from the lockdowns. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=642.0s)]
*  There were estimates put out by the UN that almost 100 million people would face starvation as a consequence of the economic dislocations caused by the lockdowns. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=649.0s)]
*  And yet the scientific community, the leaders of the scientific community decided that their policy idea of lockdowns were so necessary, so right, so just in order to to eliminate the virus or to protect people from the virus that they did not want any dissent. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=658.0s)]
*  So when Martin Sunetra and I wrote this, we were professors at Oxford, Stanford and Harvard. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=676.0s)]
*  It was a threat to their policy. It was threat to their authority. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=681.0s)]
*  When we put it out, almost a million people signed it almost overnight. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=686.0s)]
*  I mean, within a few days, we had hundreds of thousands of people signing, including tens of thousands of scientists, epidemiologists, a Nobel Prize winner, Michael Levitt at Stanford signed it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=690.0s)]
*  And so it was it was very clearly a mainstream position. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=701.0s)]
*  Jay, why were Fauci, Collins and sort of the rest of the American public health establishment? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=705.0s)]
*  What made them at the time so convinced that lockdowns were the way to go? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=713.0s)]
*  Well, I think the first thing is that these decisions about lockdowns, especially in March of 2020, were made in the midst of a panic. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=718.0s)]
*  A panic by people who are supposed to keep their calm in the middle of a crisis. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=727.0s)]
*  And there were debates in the teens, 20 teens and earlier about how to manage respiratory virus pandemics and lockdowns. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=732.0s)]
*  I mean, there were one one position, but not necessarily the main position that people have taken. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=743.0s)]
*  The plans that were in place to manage previous pandemics didn't feature lockdowns. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=748.0s)]
*  Like we had respiratory virus pandemics, for instance, the the the swine flu in 2009, probably most recent one before 2020 and others that didn't involve lockdowns because there were a lot of scientists who pointed to the damage they would do again to the poor, to children, working class. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=754.0s)]
*  And so I think for a lot of folks, Barry, that that were in the leadership of the scientific community, they they decided that this was such a new and dangerous disease that it was worth doing this extraordinary thing. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=773.0s)]
*  And it was worth ignoring the damage we were going they knew would happen to the poor, the working class and so on. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=789.0s)]
*  Because that's the only way to get a hold of it in March. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=797.0s)]
*  In March, 2020. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=800.0s)]
*  So in March of 2020, it's very easy to sympathize with why they went for lockdowns. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=801.0s)]
*  But by October of 2020, so many of the harms are already clear and they were still insisting on it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=808.0s)]
*  How much did the example of China and what China was able to do with lockdowns? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=814.0s)]
*  How much do you think that that example and the information, real or not coming out of China, how much do you think that that impacted in retrospect the American public health communities? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=818.0s)]
*  Or let's just say the people in authority. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=829.0s)]
*  How much did it impact their approach? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=832.0s)]
*  It had an enormous impact. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=834.0s)]
*  There was an email from Cliff Lane, a man named Cliff Lane, who was Tony Fauci's aide. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=836.0s)]
*  He went on the UN sort of mission to China in I think it's like February 2020. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=842.0s)]
*  Where they went to China to see if the early Chinese lockdown, January 2020 of Wuhan, had actually worked. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=851.0s)]
*  They came back, Cliff Lane sent an email to Maria Van Kurkov, who was a WHO epidemiologist, the top of the WHO epidemiologist, or one of them, saying that what China did worked. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=859.0s)]
*  And that it was really important for the public health community essentially to actually what he specifically wrote was that what China did work, we have a lot of hard decisions to make. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=872.0s)]
*  It's going to involve more than just the people in this room, meaning the people who have gone on this UN mission. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=883.0s)]
*  They came back from that trip to China in February 2020 convinced the WHO, the heads of the NIH and so on. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=888.0s)]
*  After that mission trip, that mission to China, they came back convinced that the January 2020 lockdown in China had worked at great cost, but that the world needed to copy that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=898.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=908.0s)]
*  In your scientific and academic career, had you ever been made into a pariah? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=912.0s)]
*  In other words, if you look back to scientific history and you think about Galileo or lots of people when they come up with innovative scientific ideas, often they are shunned for them. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=918.0s)]
*  That is not a thing that's unique. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=929.0s)]
*  Had you ever experienced that before the Great Barrington Declaration? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=931.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I tried to like say things that were different and unique and caused trouble. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=935.0s)]
*  Part of the fun of being a scientist is to cause trouble in that specific way. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=940.0s)]
*  But nothing on this scale. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=943.0s)]
*  I was a part of a scientific community. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=945.0s)]
*  I had my debates with people, but that was not anything like this. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=949.0s)]
*  I should say one thing really quickly. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=953.0s)]
*  The point of view that you read about the Great Barrington Declaration, that was, I mean, to me, that is not novel. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=956.0s)]
*  What Galileo said was novel. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=961.0s)]
*  It was really, really new. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=963.0s)]
*  What we were saying was what the conventional wisdom was in public health in January 2020. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=964.0s)]
*  We were just saying what seemed to me utterly obvious. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=971.0s)]
*  But the leaders of the scientific community perceived it as a kind of heresy. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=974.0s)]
*  And as you said earlier, treated me as an untouchable as a result of it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=982.0s)]
*  So it wasn't just Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci, right? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=986.0s)]
*  They sort of set the tone. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=990.0s)]
*  And what followed in your life was pretty astonishing when you look back on it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=992.0s)]
*  And I feel this way about so many things that happened in the years of 2020, 2021 in lots of areas of American life. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=996.0s)]
*  But here's some of what happened to you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1004.0s)]
*  Some of your colleagues at Stanford wrote letters and this is your language basically disowning you. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1006.0s)]
*  You told the Wall Street Journal that you couldn't sleep for months. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1011.0s)]
*  You lost 30 pounds. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1014.0s)]
*  And if you look back at we were just talking before we came on, I looked at a video interview you did from back then. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1016.0s)]
*  You look like a different person in many ways. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1021.0s)]
*  Not just the weight, but just the look on your face. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1024.0s)]
*  You received death threats. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1027.0s)]
*  People that had previously been friendly to you, colleagues of yours, crossed the street to avoid you. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1029.0s)]
*  How did that, now it's such a strange thing how much the world has changed. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1034.0s)]
*  But going back to that time, how did it impact you personally to experience that? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1039.0s)]
*  Well, I never had prepared. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1045.0s)]
*  I thought I was tough. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1049.0s)]
*  I thought I had like thick skin. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1050.0s)]
*  I realized I didn't have thick skin in 2020. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1051.0s)]
*  But especially there were death threats, which I just basically I had to just ignore because I felt an obligation to keep advocating for the scientific ideas that I had, the policy ideas I had. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1054.0s)]
*  There were attacks in the press on my wife, on my family. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1069.0s)]
*  And I just felt helpless to protect them. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1074.0s)]
*  I couldn't eat. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1077.0s)]
*  I couldn't sleep. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1079.0s)]
*  It was a very, very difficult time. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1080.0s)]
*  At one point in July 2020, I had this, I don't know what to call it, this experience where I just decided that whatever ambitions I had for myself, that I needed to just let them go. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1081.0s)]
*  That I needed to just do the things I was really put on this earth to do, which is just talk about my scientific ideas and how to manage this pandemic. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1093.0s)]
*  Because I was not speaking for myself. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1101.0s)]
*  I was speaking for the people who didn't have a voice, all the children that had suffered, the people that killed themselves. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1103.0s)]
*  The people that killed themselves from the depression and anxiety caused by the lockdowns themselves, the poor, the working class. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1109.0s)]
*  They didn't have a voice in these policies. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1117.0s)]
*  And they weren't protected from the virus. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1119.0s)]
*  They were actually exposed to the virus in a time when everyone thought it was a death sentence. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1121.0s)]
*  So I just decided I was going to let go whatever ambitions I had for my own career. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1126.0s)]
*  And then the anxiety lifted after that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1130.0s)]
*  I mean, I just felt like I crossed a Rubicon, as I told my friends at the time. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1132.0s)]
*  And I just didn't, you know, I knew that the fever would eventually break. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1138.0s)]
*  And I'm glad it has. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1142.0s)]
*  One of the things that I think typified that era, and we're just sort of starting to begin to have enough distance from it to look back on it, was a kind of a phenomenon. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1144.0s)]
*  I know for me personally, it sort of changed my view of human nature. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1156.0s)]
*  I had been raised in a very idealistic way to believe that people do the courageous thing, that people stand up for what's good and what's right. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1159.0s)]
*  It was probably my parents trying to indoctrinate me to do that by convincing me that that's what people do. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1166.0s)]
*  That's what it means to be a good human being. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1171.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden in so many areas of life, whether it was people's inability to make a distinction between peaceful protests and violent rioting, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1173.0s)]
*  whether it was sort of the excesses of DEI and the demonization of people based on their immutable characteristics or the veneration of them based on their immutable characteristics. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1182.0s)]
*  A lot of people saw these were lockdowns. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1193.0s)]
*  A lot of people saw this stuff and knew privately that it wasn't right or had their hesitations about it, but were terrified to say so publicly, frankly, because of what happened to people like you. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1195.0s)]
*  Where did you find the strength to let go, as you're describing it, of your ambitions and cross the Rubicon? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1206.0s)]
*  How did you do it? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1216.0s)]
*  I'm a Christian. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1218.0s)]
*  That has played a vital role in my life ever since I became a Christian when I was 18. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1221.0s)]
*  I've never thought about my work as really for myself, but I didn't realize I had still had these... [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1228.0s)]
*  I think any academic can probably understand what I'm saying. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1237.0s)]
*  There's a desire to be right about things, to publish your papers, influence people's ideas, and that kind of ambition, I think, it consumes the minds of so many... [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1242.0s)]
*  Basically everybody, really. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1255.0s)]
*  And letting go of that ambition and saying, okay, what's my purpose? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1257.0s)]
*  Am I really doing this for myself or am I doing this for the people I study, for the people I... [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1263.0s)]
*  I felt the obligation I had to the people I studied for a living. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1269.0s)]
*  That was what I wrote papers on, those 135 papers aiming to improve the health of others. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1274.0s)]
*  I had a greater obligation to them than I had to myself. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1280.0s)]
*  So I had to let that go. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1283.0s)]
*  It was a conviction that if you want to say it from God, I had to say I had a choice. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1286.0s)]
*  I mean, it actually was explicit. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1293.0s)]
*  The medical school at Stanford, they gave me a choice. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1296.0s)]
*  They told me I could go back to being the old professor I was, respected, writing all these papers and having a fancy position. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1301.0s)]
*  But the condition for that is I had to stop talking. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1307.0s)]
*  And I just decided I couldn't make that choice. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1311.0s)]
*  I couldn't make that bargain. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1314.0s)]
*  To do that would betray the people that I studied for a living, the vulnerable people that I studied for a living. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1316.0s)]
*  It was more important for them to me to serve them in any way I could, even if it meant sacrificing my career. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1321.0s)]
*  Jay, for people that are listeners to this show and aren't Christian, give us a little bit more on why being a Christian gave you the strength to do this. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1326.0s)]
*  Like, what is it about Christianity? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1335.0s)]
*  You were raised Hindu. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1337.0s)]
*  You became an American citizen at 17, families from India. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1338.0s)]
*  What specifically about Christianity is the strength to do this? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1342.0s)]
*  What specifically about Christianity allowed you to have the strength to do this, if you could share a little bit more? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1347.0s)]
*  Because I think it's a critically important part of your story. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1353.0s)]
*  And as we've talked about in the past, when I look back often to the sort of public dissidence of the past five years in American life, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1357.0s)]
*  and it'll be interesting to see how they respond to the other kind of a liberalism maybe that we'll talk about later in this conversation that's rising from a different part of the culture at the moment. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1368.0s)]
*  The thing that a lot of them have in common is religiosity. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1378.0s)]
*  So can you just say a little bit more about how being Christian gave you the strength to do what you did? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1381.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1388.0s)]
*  I should say this is one of those things where it's deeply personal. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1390.0s)]
*  I mean, other Christians and other people of different faiths have different ways they manage this. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1394.0s)]
*  But I'll just tell you probably the right place to do it is just to tell you how I became a Christian very briefly. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1400.0s)]
*  I mean, I was just not to brag, but I was like a really good student as a kid. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1407.0s)]
*  I mean, I was good at math, science, very competitive, did all kinds of like I was a high school debate. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1411.0s)]
*  I just wanted to be good at all these things. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1418.0s)]
*  And it was my identity. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1421.0s)]
*  It was like I was going to be good. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1423.0s)]
*  And when I say it was my identity, what I mean is that it's what gave me a sense of meaning and purpose. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1425.0s)]
*  I would say, OK, because I'm good at these things, that's what makes me valuable. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1431.0s)]
*  When I was a teenager, that's the way I thought. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1437.0s)]
*  It was unconscious. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1440.0s)]
*  I didn't really if you'd asked me as a teenager what my identity was, I would have looked like a cross-eyed like I didn't know what that meant. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1442.0s)]
*  But that's really honestly what it was. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1447.0s)]
*  And the experience becoming a Christian at 18 was I had this. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1449.0s)]
*  I mean, it came if there's no place to come from as God, because otherwise it wouldn't have come into my own head. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1456.0s)]
*  This sense of deep shame that I was judging others based on that, that the sense of moral worth that I computed to others is based on are they good at math? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1461.0s)]
*  Are you good at science? Are they good at debate? Are they good? Are they smart? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1472.0s)]
*  And I had this sense of deep shame that that was just a wrong thing to think about people. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1475.0s)]
*  That's the wrong way to interact with people is the wrong way to be with people. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1480.0s)]
*  That people's moral worth derives from the fact that they are created by God and that I'm put on this earth to love other people, even my enemies. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1484.0s)]
*  And so that part of me that revered, that had this pride in my intellect died when I became a Christian. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1494.0s)]
*  At least I thought it died until 2020. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1504.0s)]
*  And then when amazing people, people I admired forever, people like Francis Collins started attacking me, they were attacking a version of me that had died when I was 18. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1507.0s)]
*  By saying you're not smart, essentially. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1522.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. They tell me I'm a fringe epidemiologist. I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1525.0s)]
*  And they were, the version of me that I was 18 would have just shrunk and said, oh my God, what's going on? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1530.0s)]
*  I need to rethink my entire, go back and align with what they're saying because obviously I'm not smart anymore or whatever. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1538.0s)]
*  They don't think I'm smart. That version of me died when I was 18. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1545.0s)]
*  They were destroying a version of me that had already gone, was well in the past. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1548.0s)]
*  And it was that Christian experience of conversion where you have to die to yourself. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1553.0s)]
*  The parts of you that disconnect you from God really have to go. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1559.0s)]
*  That was what went when I became a Christian. And that I think is what really saved me during the pandemic. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1566.0s)]
*  One of the things that also happened during this period, so it was the public health establishment attacking you. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1573.0s)]
*  It was your colleagues at Stanford and people in your life disavowing you or distancing themselves from you. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1579.0s)]
*  And then as we found out, and part of this was because of free press reporting in the Twitter files, but then other things as well, there was also big text suppression of your ideas. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1586.0s)]
*  In Twitter, your name was sort of on a trans blacklist, as we discovered, which suppressed the visibility of your posts. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1596.0s)]
*  At YouTube, you had done a conversation with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1604.0s)]
*  It was suppressed because you were talking about how the evidence for masking children was weak. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1609.0s)]
*  Google, Reddit, Facebook, they all censored mere mentions of the Great Barrington Declaration. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1614.0s)]
*  And as we later found out, we know that the censoring was done in no small part sort of at the urging of the Biden administration. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1621.0s)]
*  And Jay, you wrote a piece for us, if something transformed in you when you became a Christian as a teenager, you wrote about how this experience sort of transformed your idea of the strength of American values or of American institutions. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1628.0s)]
*  And I want to just read a little part of this piece and have you reflect on it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1643.0s)]
*  When I was 19, and this is you, I became an American citizen. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1647.0s)]
*  It was one of the happiest days of my life. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1651.0s)]
*  The immigration officer gave me a civics test, including a question about the First Amendment. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1653.0s)]
*  And it was an easy test because I knew it in my heart. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1657.0s)]
*  The American civic religion has the right to free speech at the core of its liturgy. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1660.0s)]
*  I never imagined that there would come a time when an American government would think of violating this right or that I would be its target. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1665.0s)]
*  And then you go on to say this. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1672.0s)]
*  My parents had taught me that people here could criticize the government, even over matters of life and death, without worry that the government would censor or suppress us. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1674.0s)]
*  But over the past three years, I've been robbed of that conviction. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1682.0s)]
*  I can never go back to the uncomplicated faith and naive confidence I had in America when I was young. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1685.0s)]
*  Our government is not immune to the authoritarian impulse. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1691.0s)]
*  I have learned the hard way that it is only we, the people, who must hold an overreaching government accountable for violating our most sacred rights without our vigilance, you wrote, we will lose them. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1694.0s)]
*  Did this experience, if a part of you died, and I guess born again in becoming a Christian, did you experience something similar when it came to your faith in America or in the American civic religion during the COVID pandemic and the reactions to your work? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1704.0s)]
*  Well, first, Barry, I should thank you for the your reporting on the Twitter's trans blacklist that you were still remember that I will never forget the day when you texted me said, Jay, look what I found in the Twitter files. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1722.0s)]
*  And that it did it was, I guess I had taken America for granted, right? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1736.0s)]
*  I taken for granted that America would always have this commitment to free speech to to to this kind of diversity of ideas at its heart and that the government would would never act in a way that would aim at suppressing basic free speech rights in the way that it did during the pandemic. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1744.0s)]
*  And it did it. It did it because I mean, the hard part to really take in is that they the people that did it didn't do it because they they hated me or they actually did it because they thought they were doing good. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1763.0s)]
*  But they thought that by suppressing and silencing dissident voices who didn't agree with masking toddlers or something that they were protecting people. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1775.0s)]
*  And that that that protection warranted a violation of free speech rights that free speech was too dangerous to have during a pandemic. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1786.0s)]
*  I and I take it for granted that the government would never do that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1794.0s)]
*  But when people have take on this sort of aura of moral superiority like this, I'm on a mission to like protect people. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1798.0s)]
*  So many of the guardrails that actually protect us just go by the wayside. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1807.0s)]
*  And I thought America was immune to that and I was wrong. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1813.0s)]
*  I do think, though, that the American American idea is too powerful to ever let go. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1816.0s)]
*  And it's been heartening to see so many people of all different political parties, by the way, not just not just people, necessarily people who share my political beliefs, recovered that idea that we have to be able to speak to each other. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1822.0s)]
*  The government should not be involved in deciding which scientific position is right and scientific is wrong and destroying the lives and ability to speak of the people who disagree with the government scientists. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1837.0s)]
*  That's something I take to heart very deeply, especially as I become the director of the NIH. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1847.0s)]
*  That's going to be really important for me to make sure that people who disagree with me continue to have a voice. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1851.0s)]
*  That's the only way science advances. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1857.0s)]
*  I want to talk about your leadership and what your plans are at the NIH in a second. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1859.0s)]
*  Just two more questions sort of about the past. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1864.0s)]
*  Well, the past taking us into the future. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1867.0s)]
*  You know, five years since the Great Barrington Declaration, your stance on lockdowns has been vindicated in so many different ways. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1870.0s)]
*  We're seeing how detrimental it was for kids in the U.S. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1878.0s)]
*  Johns Hopkins released this study showing that lockdowns did little, if anything, to actually save lives during the pandemic. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1882.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people who suffered, there was a very powerful Pieschen National Review a few weeks ago by a writer whose son had special needs and talking about him having to do like physical therapy over Zoom with the mask and how he will like never be able to get over it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1889.0s)]
*  And more to the point that there's been no reckoning, there's been no public apology. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1902.0s)]
*  I guess I wanted to ask you, A, has anyone apologized to you for what happened to you back then, either personally in your life or some of the big characters we've been talking about? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1907.0s)]
*  And B, do you think that there will ever be some kind of public apology? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1912.0s)]
*  I think that there will be some kind of public apology. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1917.0s)]
*  I think that there will be some kind of public apology. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1920.0s)]
*  I've had many people apologize privately to me and some people apologize publicly, but it's not really about me, Barry. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1923.0s)]
*  I think the key thing, and you highlighted this, the key thing is how do we, we have to make plans for the next time there's a pandemic because it's not like the last pandemic we're ever going to face. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1928.0s)]
*  And B, do you think that there will ever be some kind of public apology? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1933.0s)]
*  I've had many people apologize privately to me and some people apologize publicly, but it's not really about me, Barry. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1937.0s)]
*  I think the key thing, and you highlighted this, the key thing is how do we, we have to make plans for the next time there's a pandemic because it's not like the last pandemic we're ever going to face. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1942.0s)]
*  And so we have to honestly look at what worked and what didn't work. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1952.0s)]
*  We still have not had that conversation. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1956.0s)]
*  I mean, the private apologies are nice because I can reconcile. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1959.0s)]
*  I mean, I've worked for one of the Christian practices like forgiveness, and I've had more practice with that than I ever thought I'd have in my life the last few years. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1962.0s)]
*  But it's led to the reconciliations have been great privately. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1971.0s)]
*  Publicly, what has to happen is we need to make plans for how we manage a pandemic like the one we had. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1975.0s)]
*  And I want to make sure that people understand it's not about vengeance or retribution. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1982.0s)]
*  I don't desire any of that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1988.0s)]
*  What I desire is that when we make those plans, the people that were not heard in the response to this pandemic, the children, the working class, the poor of the world, that they have a voice in this so that their well-being is taken into account. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=1989.0s)]
*  The reason why the lockdowns failed is because we live in a deeply unequal society. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2004.0s)]
*  Vast classes of people do not have the luxury to lock down the way that people, you know, fancy professors from Stanford maybe might have had. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2008.0s)]
*  And, you know, I did my best to not lock down. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2019.0s)]
*  But it was, you know, when the society around you says to lock down, you look over your shoulder when you go to work. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2023.0s)]
*  Because what if someone stops you in the street, especially if you're not white, you may have that thought in your head. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2029.0s)]
*  The entire society, March 2020 tells you to lock down. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2035.0s)]
*  I still need to go to work. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2038.0s)]
*  I feel this obligation to go to work. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2040.0s)]
*  I actually ended up not, you know, I avoided driving and rode my bike to avoid being stopped by the police. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2042.0s)]
*  I mean, and then there are people who they were. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2050.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2053.0s)]
*  I mean, I think maybe he was paranoid, but it was like the March 2020 and the whole I was hearing people would be stopped going to the grocery store. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2054.0s)]
*  So I just ended up that never ended up happening to me. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2063.0s)]
*  But like I just it's a thought I had in my head. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2065.0s)]
*  A lot of people must have had some thought like that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2068.0s)]
*  When the vaccine mandates came, so many people felt like pariahs because they had to carry around passports, vaccine passports, saying that they were clean. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2070.0s)]
*  The people who didn't, they weren't allowed to participate in normal civic life. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2079.0s)]
*  They're made to feel as if they were an other. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2082.0s)]
*  The entirety of the lockdown strategy, the reason it failed is because this is such a deeply classist policy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2085.0s)]
*  And it failed because it asked large classes of people to do the impossible, to end essentially end their participation in civic life, in their family life, in ways that are not human. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2092.0s)]
*  And so the next the key thing then is that we need to we have this reckoning mainly so that we have a real human response in the next pandemic rather than the inhuman one we had in 2020. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2106.0s)]
*  Before we get to the NIH, just one or two more questions about reconciliation. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2117.0s)]
*  People like Francis Collins, you know, said your ideas were dangerous, called you a fringe epidemiologist. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2123.0s)]
*  Have you spoken with Francis Collins at all since he made those comments? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2129.0s)]
*  I did. I have the honor of meeting him briefly in the summer of 2024. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2133.0s)]
*  And he apologized privately about the fringe epidemiology comment. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2137.0s)]
*  I think that I mean, it was a really nice moment. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2142.0s)]
*  I mean, I've admired the man for his entire for my entire career. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2147.0s)]
*  As a Christian and a scientist, he was very outspoken about his faith in ways that I found a lot of encouragement in when I was a young scientist. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2150.0s)]
*  And to me, the fact that he was on the other side of this debate and was fine, I'm on the other side of lots of people in debates, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2162.0s)]
*  but that he would use his position, really abuse his position to try to destroy people who disagreed with him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2171.0s)]
*  That really hurt. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2177.0s)]
*  And it was really nice moment when he apologized for the fringe epidemiology comment privately. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2180.0s)]
*  I think he still disagrees with me about lockdowns, which is fair enough. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2186.0s)]
*  But I think he still thinks he was wrong about them. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2190.0s)]
*  But I would like to see and I hope that from him that he would sort of start to try to publicly try to engage in that same spirit that we had when we met privately. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2193.0s)]
*  How did you respond when he apologized? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2205.0s)]
*  I've been praying for him ever since I found out that he'd written that email even before when I saw that the press, I told him that that I've been praying for him. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2207.0s)]
*  And I still will pray for him. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2217.0s)]
*  I think that reconciliation is really is possible. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2220.0s)]
*  I believe it. I believe it very firmly. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2223.0s)]
*  Even people disagree with each other fundamentally, even hate each other. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2225.0s)]
*  And I'd never hated him and never will. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2228.0s)]
*  So it was it's I think it's it's you know, I'm just going to keep praying for that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2230.0s)]
*  The kind of grace that you are able to approach the subject with is one that I think eludes many people in this country, maybe millions of people in this country who feel so betrayed by what happened, who feel like their children. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2236.0s)]
*  I mean, we don't need to go through all of the examples. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2255.0s)]
*  Every single person listening to this knows someone in their life who was harmed either by covid itself or by the measures that were taken to mitigate covid. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2258.0s)]
*  What is your advice to people looking for looking to move on who still believe that what was done was profoundly wrong, but are not going to get a kind of truth and reconciliation commission on covid? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2270.0s)]
*  You know, what do you say to those people? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2288.0s)]
*  I mean, I still think, Barry, if you think back to 2020 and 2021, the government told us, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2291.0s)]
*  public health officials especially told us that we shouldn't interact with our family, that we should let that we should bury our parents or grandparents alone. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2298.0s)]
*  And especially in 2021, when the vaccines came out, there was a sense of like, are you clean or unclean? If you're vaccinated, you're clean, and if you're not, you're unclean. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2311.0s)]
*  And that led to splitting of families. Remember the Thanksgivings where people were uninvited because they were not unvaccinated or something. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2321.0s)]
*  The end point of that is a society that I think nobody wants to live in, no matter where you were in 2020 or 2021. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2331.0s)]
*  That kind of reconciliation that we've been talking about is really the only way forward. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2340.0s)]
*  And that starts with saying, OK, I'm not saying that what was done was wrong, right, in 2020, 2020 wasn't right. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2344.0s)]
*  I firmly disagree with that, with especially the policies that divided people into clean and unclean were deeply inhuman. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2352.0s)]
*  But at the same time, these are people that are friends, that are family members, they're people that we respect, and they're still human. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2360.0s)]
*  And their purpose isn't to destroy them. We have to find some way so that we can continue to learn from them because they're going to be right on things that I'm wrong on at some point. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2370.0s)]
*  And so and it's going to be to me, if I keep that anger and that bitterness inside, it's going to destroy me. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2380.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to move forward with the kinds of things that I think are really important for our society and for my personal life and for my family and for the people I love going forward. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2390.0s)]
*  I have to let the anger go and let you know, it's going to be God that deals with that, whatever, whatever, whatever problems there. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2402.0s)]
*  But it won't be me that deals with with wreaking vengeance. It's not my purpose. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2409.0s)]
*  I have no goal for that. My purpose is to, especially now that I have this new job, to make to have the scientific establishment work toward improving the health of the American people. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2415.0s)]
*  That's it. That's the main purpose I have now. And I need to do it with people that disagreed with me in 2020. That's fine. People disagreed with me in 2021. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2425.0s)]
*  A lot of them are smarter than me. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2434.0s)]
*  Many people on the right, and I think both of us know people like this, have made Fauci the sort of singular villain of the COVID story, almost more than the origins of the virus. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2436.0s)]
*  Broadly, and you see this kind of stuff all the time, broadly, has the response to Fauci been reasonable or unreasonable in your view? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2448.0s)]
*  Okay, so I think that this is a complicated question in part because I think I mean, first, Tony Fauci, and I think for reasons that are defensible, maybe, although I would have disagreed with them, in 2014, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2458.0s)]
*  enabled the US government to continue to support research in China, the kind of research that's gained a function research that may have caused the pandemic. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2473.0s)]
*  He has that in his thing to think about. So there's that. But at the same time, he also became the face of the public health response to the pandemic in 2020. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2482.0s)]
*  And he embraced that role. I mean, this is just in terms of what the responsibility is. That's something, people had votive candles to him. They were like, Fauci, we trust. I mean, they were like these kinds of like... [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2497.0s)]
*  I remember. It was such a Rorschach test. Some people regarded him as villainous. Other people regarded him as something like a saint. And I still feel that that's the case. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2509.0s)]
*  Like he became a caricature and not a person. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2523.0s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, some of it was not his fault. I mean, people were looking for a guru figure to save them when they were scared about being dying from this new virus. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2527.0s)]
*  But he fully embraced that role. And so the consequences of that are down the line. It's going to be very divisive. He's going to become somebody. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2537.0s)]
*  He's no longer Tony Fauci, the scientist who he is this cultural figure, even beyond science. Like he's the face of the pandemic response. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2545.0s)]
*  And so the question then is, what does one do about that? So I think from a personal perspective, I want to extend him the same grace that I want to extend to everybody. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2557.0s)]
*  I think he was deeply wrong in his scientific ideas in 2020. But, you know, I believe he was sincere in them. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2567.0s)]
*  And I think that he was trying to do what he viewed as the best for the American people. And so I want to honor that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2576.0s)]
*  So I think really just depersonalize it. President Biden pardoned him. And actually, I'm in favor of that. I think that that was a really good thing. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2582.0s)]
*  Right. Let's have an honest discussion about the policies. Let's use the NIH, the resources of it to make American healthy again. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2592.0s)]
*  If I can take the phrase from from from Bobby Kennedy and rather than trying to to destroy people, let's use let's use the time that we now have to learn the lessons of the past and build people up. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2603.0s)]
*  OK, well, Jay, you were just confirmed to run the NIH and you are taking on this role at a really difficult time, maybe not as hard as the height of the covid pandemic, but very hard. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2618.0s)]
*  And that's because I'm not saying anything new to say this faith in public health and faith in science itself, you could argue, feels very broken, unlike any period I've ever experienced in my life. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2628.0s)]
*  Before we get into the details of how you're planning to run the NIH and what exactly the NIH does, big picture. How can you start to rebuild the trust that has been so broken? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2642.0s)]
*  Well, OK, so first of all, the the the you have to figure out why there's distrust. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2656.0s)]
*  And right now there's two stories for why people say why there's distrust. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2664.0s)]
*  Like so story one is that people spread misinformation. A lot of people believe the misinformation and all we have to do is is reestablish our authority as scientists as high as like these deep, knowledgeable gurus and and suppress the people that spreading this information and people will trust us again. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2667.0s)]
*  That's that's story one. I just I reject that story. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2685.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you why, because the story too is that the public health establishment made tremendous mistakes with with with a mantle of authority during the pandemic. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2690.0s)]
*  They said, trust us. Don't send your kids to school. Don't go to work. Don't don't don't don't go to Thanksgiving with your friends. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2701.0s)]
*  Don't visit your with your family when they're in the hospital. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2710.0s)]
*  They had a do vaccinate in order to protect others from getting the disease. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2714.0s)]
*  You know, they told us all these things that turned out not to be true. Do mask your toddlers. They do not turn out not to be true or productive or useful. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2721.0s)]
*  And as a result, very rationally, the large parts of the population decided the scientists are full of it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2728.0s)]
*  The public health is full of it. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2736.0s)]
*  So those are the two stories, the two competing screens that you're seeing in front of you. Right. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2739.0s)]
*  So right now, and I very firmly believe that the second is true. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2744.0s)]
*  And I don't see how that first story anyone can go back to that sort of uncomplicated faith that scientists have your best interest at heart. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2750.0s)]
*  They have they they they know better than you how you should live your own life. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2758.0s)]
*  You can look to them for for advice about what to eat, how to how to you know, where what whether you should send your kids to school, whether you should mask your mask your children, you know, or whatever else that they say. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2764.0s)]
*  Now it's now you can say and I completely agree that it was very complicated during the pandemic. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2775.0s)]
*  There was lots of new disease. We don't know how to deal with it. And I completely agree with that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2780.0s)]
*  There's going to be disagreements. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2784.0s)]
*  The problem is and I'll just I use this as a sort of simple way to say this. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2788.0s)]
*  When I was a med student, a third year med student in medical school, the first two years you study all these like class, you say in class a lot. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2793.0s)]
*  You know, you learn biochemistry, you learn, you know, all these all these like things and you read textbooks. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2798.0s)]
*  The third and fourth years, you actually start to see patients that third year when you first go into the clinic, you put on a white coat and you put on a white coat and you put on a white coat. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2803.0s)]
*  I should probably just speak for myself. I knew nothing. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2812.0s)]
*  I knew I was really great at all of the textbooks and that your patient front of you and they're asking a question and it's not in the textbook and you don't have a depth of experience. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2817.0s)]
*  You're brand new third year medical student. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2822.0s)]
*  You have the white coat on. They expect you to have an answer. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2825.0s)]
*  And I mean, the temptation and you don't. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2828.0s)]
*  Yeah, you should. You really are tempted to say, here's the answer. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2831.0s)]
*  When you don't have any idea what you're going to do, you're going to be like, oh, I'm going to do this. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2834.0s)]
*  You really are tempted to say, here's the answer. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2839.0s)]
*  When you don't have any idea what the answer is, the right thing to do, the thing that you should that the teachers tell you to do is be honest. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2842.0s)]
*  Tell them you do not have an answer when you don't have an answer. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2849.0s)]
*  That's what the public health authorities didn't do in 2020. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2852.0s)]
*  In 2021, they don't the mantle of authority based on on a scientific knowledge base that was that didn't give them the scientific or moral authority to do that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2856.0s)]
*  They trespassed in areas of life. Should we suppress the speech rights of others? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2868.0s)]
*  Scientists said yes in 2021 and in 2020. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2873.0s)]
*  Should we separate people between who are vaccinated and unvaccinated with passports? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2878.0s)]
*  That's a complicated policy question, not just a scientific question. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2885.0s)]
*  I mean, I think there's very few situations where such a thing might be warranted, or maybe none. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2889.0s)]
*  So they trespassed the normal authority that they would have and did things that far beyond what their scientific knowledge would actually empower them to do. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2895.0s)]
*  And as a result, so many people now disagree with us that don't trust scientists, the things scientists say. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2907.0s)]
*  And there's real consequences, because if you have that distrust, a lot of the good that science does will not actually result in good for the people. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2914.0s)]
*  Well, it's like the scientists and the experts, or at least many of them, broke our trust by going too far or by, you know, as you as you just outlined, weighing in on things that were beyond their purview, trying to pretend they knew all the answers when they didn't, not having humility. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2924.0s)]
*  But I don't think any of us wants to live in a world, Jay, in which there are no scientific experts, where there are no authorities, where there are no gatekeepers. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2942.0s)]
*  Right. And I think to me, that is the most naughty and complicated thing about the moment we're in. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2951.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a better world where people are getting their medical advice from random people on YouTube that tell you that, you know, waving a crystal in front of your face will cure your cancer. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2958.0s)]
*  But you're right that there's not like a quick way of reversing the trust that's been broken. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2969.0s)]
*  So now people are about to look to you in a major way. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2976.0s)]
*  What are some of the messages broadly that you want to give to people about why gatekeepers, I guess, is a way of saying it, or experts are worth having again? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2979.0s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2991.0s)]
*  In other words, like, again, I don't think we want to live in a Wild West world where there is no authority whatsoever. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=2992.0s)]
*  But there's not a quick way. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3000.0s)]
*  There's not like a, you know, a switch we can flip in order to get it back immediately and overnight. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3002.0s)]
*  So what are the messages that you are going to be giving to regain the trust from people? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3011.0s)]
*  So I think to me, this might be the most important initiative that I had in my mind when I was asked to be the NIH director. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3017.0s)]
*  How do you reestablish that trust? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3025.0s)]
*  I think you go back to basics about what science really is. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3027.0s)]
*  So, Barry, if I write a paper and it has some result in it, and I publish it in a fantasy journal, I'm a fantasy professor in a fancy university, I publish it, that doesn't mean it's true, even though it's peer reviewed. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3030.0s)]
*  This peer review doesn't mean that they double-checked my work where they actually redid the experiment or what not. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3042.0s)]
*  They didn't replicate it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3048.0s)]
*  The scientific result starts to be true when, you know, you independently try to answer the same question, you find the same answer as me. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3049.0s)]
*  The idea of replication is at the heart of truth in science. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3057.0s)]
*  Independent replication is the heart of truth in science. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3061.0s)]
*  So what should happen is rather than having authority being the, that can be abused as the measure of truth in science, I'm not a fancy university, am I the head of the NIH? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3064.0s)]
*  Instead, it's, is the scientific work replicated? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3078.0s)]
*  And then when people are talking about it, they can look and see, you know, oh, look, here are all these papers that find the same result. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3081.0s)]
*  Here's some weird results with stuff we don't know. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3088.0s)]
*  We can have a scientific authority more rooted in scientific reality if we make replication the heart of scientific truth. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3091.0s)]
*  And that's actually what I have some concrete plans on how to make that happen at the NIH. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3101.0s)]
*  But that, I think, is the answer to the question. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3105.0s)]
*  You're not going to get, you're not going to regain the authority we once had by saying, trust us, we were wrong then, but we're now right. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3107.0s)]
*  We're going to keep doing the same thing. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3114.0s)]
*  That's never going to work. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3116.0s)]
*  What will work is, look, here are the changes we've made so that what we're, the advice we're giving you is more rooted in reality than we had before. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3117.0s)]
*  We've changed how we do things. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3128.0s)]
*  And so that's how you think rebuild the trust. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3129.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3132.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the NIH itself. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3133.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people know the NIH is important but actually don't know what it does. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3136.0s)]
*  I know it has a budget of around $50 billion. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3143.0s)]
*  I know that it's like 27 different agencies, and I don't even understand how that works. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3145.0s)]
*  But broadly, what is the job of the NIH? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3151.0s)]
*  What is this job you're about to step into? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3154.0s)]
*  It has a very simple mission that I think literally everybody agrees with. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3157.0s)]
*  The mission of the NIH is to support and conduct science that advances the health and longevity of the American people and by extension the people of the whole world. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3163.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3174.0s)]
*  That's a very, very simple, compelling mission. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3175.0s)]
*  I'm sure I got the words a little wrong, but I convey the spirit of it. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3177.0s)]
*  Is it doing that right now? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3182.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's sort of failed. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3184.0s)]
*  It's since 2012, the United States life expectancy is flatlined. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3186.0s)]
*  Between 2012 and 2019, there was no increase in the American life expectancy. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3190.0s)]
*  And of course, it collapsed during the pandemic because I think only last year it came back to pre-pandemic levels. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3195.0s)]
*  And the most basic thing is that advancing the life expectancy of the country, it's not actually succeeding at doing that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3200.0s)]
*  There's complicated reasons why beyond science. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3207.0s)]
*  But I'll say at the very least, if the mission statement is to be read and taken seriously, it has not accomplished that for at least a decade or more. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3209.0s)]
*  And it's one of these things where everywhere you look, you see challenges to American health that the NIH has not actually addressed effectively. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3219.0s)]
*  Rising obesity levels, the type 1 and type 2 diabetes, chronic disease. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3230.0s)]
*  Cancer I think is like number one, number two cause of death still, despite major advances in the biological sciences. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3238.0s)]
*  And now I painted this bleak picture about the outcomes, but let me just defend the agency I'm about to lead because I do want to do that for a second. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3246.0s)]
*  There have been tremendous advances in biological sciences, our understanding of the human genome, our understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3254.0s)]
*  advances in treatments for countless conditions that the NIH is responsible for. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3264.0s)]
*  And those are things that NIH and the American people, which funds it, should rightly and justly be proud of. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3271.0s)]
*  Those need to continue and they need to be, we need to do even better than we have done them because those advances need to translate into better health for the people. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3278.0s)]
*  The questions that your listeners have about how should I eat? What kinds of exercise are good for me? Should I take this drug? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3289.0s)]
*  Is it going to solve the chronic problem I have? All these questions are in the purview of the NIH and the NIH needs to really answer those questions that are uppermost in the minds and bodies of the American people. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3298.0s)]
*  One critical thing I think for people to understand is that the NIH is the primary funder of medical research in this country. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3312.0s)]
*  Broadly, Jay, what are the areas that are overfunded and what are the areas in your view that are underfunded right now? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3320.0s)]
*  Right. So the principal way to answer that, Barry, is by looking at what are the epidemiological needs, the medical needs of the American people. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3328.0s)]
*  If you look at the epidemiological data, it's metabolic syndrome and obesity, it's cancer, it's diabetes, it's at shockingly high levels and it's not just older people, it's young people, children. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3335.0s)]
*  The NIH portfolio of investments in biomedical research should match the needs of the health needs of the people. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3350.0s)]
*  That's actually what Bobby Kennedy has been saying and I can totally agree with that. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3360.0s)]
*  The chronic disease crisis that we face is tremendous. It affects almost every single American in some way or other. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3364.0s)]
*  And we don't have excellent answers, reliable answers to those questions. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3371.0s)]
*  That's why people turn to so many different sources because they're looking for answers on how to improve their own lives, their health and their well-being in their own lives. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3376.0s)]
*  And it should be the NIH providing those answers with excellent science. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3386.0s)]
*  And I don't want to paint with too broad a brush because I do think the NIH has done so many great things, even over the last few decades, to address those. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3390.0s)]
*  But we haven't done enough and it has not translated to actually solving the chronic disease crisis the American people face. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3399.0s)]
*  Critics of publicly funded research and critics of the NIH talk a lot about how the researchers have conflicts of interest because they're also funded often, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3407.0s)]
*  at least by the pharmaceutical industry, or they talk about the revolving door that they'll work at the NIH and then they'll take a job at Big Pharma down the line. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3418.0s)]
*  And this is a big, big criticism of the Maha movement that says, well, if you want to know why we haven't solved these chronic diseases, it's because there's not a lot of money in it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3425.0s)]
*  How do you address that broad criticism? Do you agree with it? Disagree with it? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3435.0s)]
*  I agree with it entirely. So, for instance, I want to tie it back to something we just talked about earlier, the trust in scientists. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3439.0s)]
*  There's a thing, there's a law passed called the Sunshine Act. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3447.0s)]
*  So anyone can go to something called OpenSecrets.gov and they can put their doctor's name in this database, this government database, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3451.0s)]
*  and it'll tell you all the pharmaceutical money that your doctor has received. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3459.0s)]
*  There's no such database for scientists, and yet scientists undergird and support the treatments that the doctors, the doctors you go to actually decide what they're going to do. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3462.0s)]
*  You should be able to go look up the conflicts of interest of scientists, just like you can go and look up the conflicts of interest of doctors. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3474.0s)]
*  That's something that's... [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3482.0s)]
*  So should there be an OpenSecrets for scientists? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3483.0s)]
*  I think so. I think that would be a really, really productive thing as a way to reestablish trust. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3488.0s)]
*  I just want to be clear. I don't mean to say that if you're pharmaceutical company funded, that means you're necessarily wrong. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3493.0s)]
*  Truth is not determined by that. It's not determined by... [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3499.0s)]
*  Truth is determined by other independent people replicating your work find the same thing. Right? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3502.0s)]
*  But you have a right to know as an American citizen, is this research that is affecting my treatment, who's doing it? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3508.0s)]
*  What are their conflicts? What are their interests? Right? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3517.0s)]
*  So I think that's all to the good. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3519.0s)]
*  And I think that the work of the NIH in particular, it affects basically every single aspect of biomedical research, you name it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3522.0s)]
*  If you don't... And of course there are peculiar interests involved. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3533.0s)]
*  People make money off of the results of the research. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3538.0s)]
*  The reason why the NIH exists, and again, the Maha movement is right on this, there are things, the research that you do, that can be patented, that can result in you becoming very, very rich. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3541.0s)]
*  And there are scientific studies that are nevertheless quite important, even though they have no capacity of being patented. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3552.0s)]
*  Won't make you rich, and yet it is vital for it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3559.0s)]
*  Let's just take something like the structure of DNA, the double helix structure of DNA, right? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3562.0s)]
*  Conducted by scientists working with Watson and Crick in the 1950s. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3567.0s)]
*  That basic idea undergirds so much of science, it's not a patentable idea. Right? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3573.0s)]
*  The NIH exists to provide support for research that can't possibly be done by pharmaceutical companies because they won't have any monetary interest in it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3579.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, it's important for pharmaceutical companies to know, other scientists to know, or for the people to know. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3594.0s)]
*  The NIH, really primarily, the reason it exists is to fund that kind of science. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3599.0s)]
*  Which is not to say that it shouldn't participate in trying to make the advances available. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3606.0s)]
*  That may involve working with companies to try to help their research potentially, if they can convince the scientists at the NIH that it's worth investing in. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3611.0s)]
*  The public-private partnerships are not necessarily bad or wrong, but the primary purpose of the NIH is to do that kind of science for the public good. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3621.0s)]
*  Science that cannot be funded by pharmaceutical companies or other interests. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3629.0s)]
*  One of the things that's been hotly debated, of course, since the lab leak became a thing, is this idea of gain-of-function research. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3633.0s)]
*  Which no one that I know had ever heard of before the pandemic, and now it's something that everyone claims to be an expert in. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3640.0s)]
*  But it's basically altering things like viruses in a lab to enhance or add new abilities. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3646.0s)]
*  I'm being crude about it. Should gain-of-function research be banned? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3652.0s)]
*  Okay, so you have to be careful here. There's some gain-of-function research that's entirely benign, has no chance of causing a pandemic, and might even be a vital tool for advancing human health. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3657.0s)]
*  For instance, you have some protein you want expressed so that you can use it as a treatment. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3667.0s)]
*  Insulin is a good example of this. You change the DNA of an E. coli, use the E. coli bacteria to produce the insulin cheaply. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3673.0s)]
*  That's gain-of-function work. There's nothing wrong with that. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3682.0s)]
*  But there is gain-of-function work that has the potential to cause a pandemic. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3685.0s)]
*  You take a virus you find in a bat cave in China, coronavirus, you add a biochemical element. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3689.0s)]
*  This is not theoretical. You add an element to it that makes it more transmissible among human cells. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3696.0s)]
*  And then you do that in a setting where it might infect the lab technician who takes it home without knowing it, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3703.0s)]
*  and affects their family, and causes a pandemic that causes so much damage. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3711.0s)]
*  That kind of research, a research that has any capacity of causing a pandemic through gain-of-function work, should be banned. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3716.0s)]
*  I think it has no place among the toolkit of scientists. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3723.0s)]
*  Essentially what you have is you have a few scientists taking risks on behalf of the entire human population. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3729.0s)]
*  And to do it in an unregulated way makes absolutely no sense to me. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3737.0s)]
*  Even if you don't agree that that is what led to this past pandemic, I happen to think it does, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3741.0s)]
*  but even if you don't agree, going forward, why would you say, yes, you should take that risk? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3747.0s)]
*  There aren't enough benefits to that kind of research to warrant causing a pandemic that can kill 10 million, 20 million people, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3752.0s)]
*  if you include the lockdown harms, and cause trillions of dollars of damage, and set society back for so long. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3761.0s)]
*  What knowledge gain would be worth that? Why would you risk that? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3768.0s)]
*  I read a report that the administration is considering prepping an EO, banning federal funding for gain-of-function research. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3772.0s)]
*  If there is an EO, you would be responsible for enforcing it. You have a nuanced view of this situation. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3782.0s)]
*  Do you think the Trump administration understands your view? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3788.0s)]
*  I just started in my job area, so I shouldn't get too far ahead of what's going to happen with this. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3791.0s)]
*  But I anticipate that if there is some action by the Trump administration that they'll consult me. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3799.0s)]
*  There are many people actually in the government that share my view, that I trust. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3804.0s)]
*  I anticipate whatever comes out of this process will be a thoughtful one. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3808.0s)]
*  I don't think the goal is to end scientific research. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3814.0s)]
*  The Trump administration still supports $50 billion of research at the NIH a year. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3819.0s)]
*  We still support excellent scientific research aimed at making American people healthier. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3824.0s)]
*  That's not going to change. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3829.0s)]
*  And if gain-of-function work that doesn't have a chance of causing a pandemic is needed to do that, we'll continue to support that. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3831.0s)]
*  I can't speak for any EO that would be on the President's sort of bailiwick. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3838.0s)]
*  But I know that the advice you'll get will be, I think, along the lines that I'm saying. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3845.0s)]
*  You have to make those careful, nuanced distinctions when you do this kind of regulation. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3851.0s)]
*  I anticipate fully that's exactly what will happen. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3855.0s)]
*  One of the biggest stories in Washington right now is the Department of Government Efficiency that began as a meme [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3857.0s)]
*  but is now slashing tons of money to steelman their position in government waste. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3864.0s)]
*  And a lot of what they revealed has been just frankly so depressing for those of us that pay a lot of taxes to know where that money is going. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3870.0s)]
*  And for people that pay any kind of taxes, frankly. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3879.0s)]
*  Right now there's about 20,000 people that work at the NIH doing all sorts of research. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3883.0s)]
*  There was a recent announcement that the NIH is going to cap reimbursements for things like facilities, administrative support, and infrastructure for research at like 15%. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3889.0s)]
*  That's projected to save taxpayers something like $4 billion. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3900.0s)]
*  20,000 people, that sounds like a lot of people, first of all. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3907.0s)]
*  I don't understand how you manage 20,000 people. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3911.0s)]
*  I'd love to get your advice. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3913.0s)]
*  I'm having trouble managing like 50 at the free press. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3914.0s)]
*  But do you imagine cutting back? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3916.0s)]
*  Like what are your plans in terms of doging the NIH, if at all? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3919.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3923.0s)]
*  So in the context of the NIH, the doge efforts, I think, have primarily focused on efficiency rather than cutting. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3925.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3934.0s)]
*  So the budget is still $50 billion. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3935.0s)]
*  That's allocated by Congress and there's no cut to that. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3936.0s)]
*  And efficiency here means making sure that the dollars that the American people entrust the NIH with actually go to research that actually advances their health, meaning the mission of the NIH. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3941.0s)]
*  And part of that means looking at the... [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3951.0s)]
*  So it's a little convoluted and a lot of people hearing this might not fully understand this because it's like one of these things I have to get my mind around. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3955.0s)]
*  So as a scientist, when I write a grant for the NIH, the NIH will give me, just to take a number that's clean, let's say the NIH gives me $100,000 to do some scientific project. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3964.0s)]
*  I will have... [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3975.0s)]
*  I've written out in excruciating detail exactly where every dollar is going to go. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3977.0s)]
*  Like I'm going to pay the salaries of my postdocs. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3981.0s)]
*  I'm going to get data sets. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3983.0s)]
*  I'm going to... [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3984.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3985.0s)]
*  The beakers, whatever. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3986.0s)]
*  Every single item. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3987.0s)]
*  The NIH then also pays the administrators at my university or my institution an additional amount on top of that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3989.0s)]
*  So for instance at Stanford it's something like 55%. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3996.0s)]
*  It's like a tip on top of the $100,000. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=3999.0s)]
*  That is supposed to go to support the building, the infrastructure, and a whole bunch of other sort of fixed cost of research. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4002.0s)]
*  That money is, while it's audited every couple of years, it's audited in ways that are I think much looser than the data sets that we have. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4010.0s)]
*  The line items that the researchers get. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4019.0s)]
*  What's at stake in this 15% fight isn't the total funding for research. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4021.0s)]
*  It's how much goes to the fixed cost of research versus how much goes to the researchers themselves. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4025.0s)]
*  And that's the debate. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4033.0s)]
*  A lot of the public discussion over this sort of hasn't got this point exactly right. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4034.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4040.0s)]
*  It's in the interest of the NIH to support these institutions so that they can have the benches, the disposal of radioactive waste, you name it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4041.0s)]
*  It's in the interest of the American people to support the institution so they can have the fixed cost of research funded. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4052.0s)]
*  It's also in the American people's interest that we fund scientists to examine questions that advance American health. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4058.0s)]
*  But how we do that, how much should go to the administrators versus how much should go to the scientists, that's what's at stake. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4064.0s)]
*  That's been the focus of DOJ. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4070.0s)]
*  And I think that that's an issue that is worth bringing up. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4072.0s)]
*  And I'm really glad that DOJ has brought up. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4075.0s)]
*  We're going to end up with a better equilibrium so that more of the money goes to research and that the administration's to support the fixed cost of these research institutions is done more efficiently. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4077.0s)]
*  That'll be the end point of this debate. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4088.0s)]
*  I think that everyone reasonable, right or left, Republican or Democrat, does not want inefficiency and hates bureaucracy. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4090.0s)]
*  Anyone that's been to a DMV feels that way. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4099.0s)]
*  The issue is that some senior scientists say that their work has been really disrupted already because of DOJ. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4101.0s)]
*  There's been firing and rehiring of employees. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4109.0s)]
*  There's the $1 spending limit on federal government credit cards. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4112.0s)]
*  Some researchers have said that they're struggling to purchase basic supplies, struggling to pay their post-docs. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4116.0s)]
*  How do you understand, to the extent that you do or agree with it, the practical chaos on the ground right now? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4125.0s)]
*  Has that been overstated? Is that real? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4131.0s)]
*  Where do you sit? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4134.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think my literal first day is tomorrow actually on the Bethesda campus. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4136.0s)]
*  So I'm going to need to go and assess things. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4142.0s)]
*  My sense from looking at it from the outside is that at least part of it is there's a consolidation of IT and communications. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4145.0s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of shops inside the NIH doing duplicative things. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4159.0s)]
*  There's some of that. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4165.0s)]
*  I think a lot of the personnel changes will involve consolidating some of that and making it more efficient. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4166.0s)]
*  A lot of the things that you just talked about in the outside and scientific community, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4172.0s)]
*  I think part of it stems from the fact that so much of the scientific community is on the left and they didn't vote for President Trump. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4176.0s)]
*  And so almost any change made is going to end up causing anxiety. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4184.0s)]
*  And of course, there's some real things to this. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4189.0s)]
*  There was a freezing of scientific review committee meetings, for instance. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4192.0s)]
*  I think part of that was an overread by some of the federal bureaucracy in the things that kind of happen normally when there's a transition in presidential power. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4199.0s)]
*  There's like an external communications freeze that was overread so that private meetings, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4211.0s)]
*  scientific panel meetings was also frozen as a result of the external communication ban. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4217.0s)]
*  These are private meetings that probably shouldn't have been frozen. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4223.0s)]
*  I'm going to try to restore as quickly as we can normal scientific function. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4225.0s)]
*  Efficiency means doing those things. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4230.0s)]
*  Normal scientific function will restart. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4236.0s)]
*  I think the interim director, Matt Memley, has done a fantastic job trying to get those things up and running. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4239.0s)]
*  And I'm going to continue to do that after I get in place. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4244.0s)]
*  We have to rebuild trust, not just with the American people, but with the scientific community. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4247.0s)]
*  The administration I'm in, from everything I've heard, is fully committed to doing some excellent science. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4251.0s)]
*  The Maha agenda, this Make America Healthy Again agenda, is going to require excellent science. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4259.0s)]
*  The United States is going to be a tremendously important part of that. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4264.0s)]
*  Speaking of Maha, I think it's one of the most interesting movements in American life. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4267.0s)]
*  First of all, because it's very, very hard to pin down politically. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4272.0s)]
*  And second, because the tent is just so wide, or at least it is for now. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4276.0s)]
*  It includes people like crunchy moms, or even just moms that want healthier food for their kids, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4280.0s)]
*  who want to be able to get European formula that's not been available here in the U.S. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4287.0s)]
*  I know my wife goes to this random Polish place in Greenpoint in order to be able to get it on the black market for our son, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4293.0s)]
*  which seems kind of ridiculous. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4302.0s)]
*  But then it also includes people that believe things that I regard at least as dangerous to public health. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4304.0s)]
*  How do you define the Maha movement before we get into RFK and Maha and all the things it encompasses? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4311.0s)]
*  And do you yourself identify as Maha? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4318.0s)]
*  So first, the Maha movement, I think it's exactly what you described. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4321.0s)]
*  A very broad tent of people, many of whom were not previously politically active, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4326.0s)]
*  who want themselves and their families to be healthier. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4331.0s)]
*  And they look around and they see all kinds of things where they don't know if it actually contributes to their health. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4335.0s)]
*  Like the food on the shelves, the drugs that they take, advice that they get about what kinds of exercise to do, lifestyles and so on. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4342.0s)]
*  And they just want, really it's regular people just saying, I want to be healthier. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4351.0s)]
*  Why I don't want to face the kind of health problems that Americans have faced at scale over the last few decades. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4356.0s)]
*  Let's find a way so that we can solve that problem. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4364.0s)]
*  I think that to me is the Maha movement. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4368.0s)]
*  And so the second question, do I identify? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4370.0s)]
*  Yeah, I absolutely identify with that. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4373.0s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4375.0s)]
*  I don't, you know, I just give you an example of this. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4376.0s)]
*  So when I was in the 1980s, my dad was a type two diabetic, had a heart attack when he was 48. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4379.0s)]
*  We followed all the advice. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4388.0s)]
*  Like he took, like he had a low fat diet and he was an extremely disciplined man. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4391.0s)]
*  So he would, you know, like oatmeal for breakfast, rice and lentils for lunch, rice, lentils and like saltless chicken or something for dinner. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4397.0s)]
*  That sounds horrible. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4408.0s)]
*  And then he got a heart attack at 56 and died. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4409.0s)]
*  And, you know, I don't know what the right answer. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4413.0s)]
*  A lot of the scientific basis for the advice that we all hear, it just needs to be solid, needs to be more solid, more accurate, more right, more grounded. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4417.0s)]
*  And I think this is one of those things where like if you look at it that way, Maha is completely, it should be a universal thing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4427.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4436.0s)]
*  We just need to have better advice grounded in science for the basic decisions we make in our own lives. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4437.0s)]
*  As director of the NIH, you have a boss, you report to the secretary of the HHS and that's RFKJ as some call him, Robert F. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4443.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr., probably the most controversial and high profile HHS secretary ever. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4452.0s)]
*  Broadly, what's your view on him? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4460.0s)]
*  I admire him actually, Barry. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4463.0s)]
*  I think he's said that for the last 20 years, he wakes up in the morning asking how can I make the lives of children better, healthier? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4465.0s)]
*  How can I make the lives of people better? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4476.0s)]
*  How can we address the chronic health needs of the American people? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4479.0s)]
*  And I believe him. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4482.0s)]
*  I see every time I've had an interaction with him, that is what he wants to do. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4483.0s)]
*  It's like he wants to ask, you know, I just take probably the most controversial example of what he said, things about having to do with autism. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4486.0s)]
*  He has ideas about what causes autism. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4494.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you from a scientific point of view, first, there's been a tremendous increase in autism diagnoses. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4496.0s)]
*  And I look at the data, you can't avoid seeing it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4502.0s)]
*  Huge increases in autism diagnoses. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4507.0s)]
*  And everyone has their pet theory for why. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4509.0s)]
*  And yet, we don't know why. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4514.0s)]
*  I, as a scientist, do not know the answer to that question. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4516.0s)]
*  And so when I hear moms asking me how can I prevent my child from becoming autistic? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4520.0s)]
*  What should I do for my autistic child? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4526.0s)]
*  It's hard to answer because I'm now I'm back on with the with the third year medical student with the white coat on and I can try to and I know the answer when I don't. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4529.0s)]
*  The answer in that situation is to do excellent science so that we can ask, we can find out what causes it. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4539.0s)]
*  And then we can address it in an informed way. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4547.0s)]
*  I'm really glad you brought that up because obviously I was going to go there and you anticipated it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4549.0s)]
*  The most controversial thing, I think, that RFK believes and the reason that I think many people who are broadly sympathetic to the Maha movement are nevertheless concerned about parts of it is because of this vaccine hesitancy that it injects into the broader debate. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4554.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is, and you tell me if this is wrong, my understanding was that the scientific consensus was that vaccines do not cause autism. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4572.0s)]
*  And what RFK has been saying for many years is that that consensus is not accurate or should be looked into. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4581.0s)]
*  Am I characterized that correctly? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4588.0s)]
*  I mean, so there's aspects of it that maybe I'll just tweak just a little bit, but like broadly broadly broadly speaking, the idea that all vaccines do not cause autism and that that's been looked at by scientists. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4592.0s)]
*  That essentially was the premise of public health messaging for decades. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4607.0s)]
*  It's a fact. So just so for instance, there's a fact that not every single vaccine has been examined for whether it's linked to autism. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4613.0s)]
*  Some of the key ones that have been given to children for decades, like the MMR vaccine, there have been, in my view, good studies that fail to show a link. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4623.0s)]
*  But so for instance, I'll just take one specific one from recently, right? So on the childhood schedule is the COVID vaccine. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4632.0s)]
*  Recommended, I forget, I haven't looked at recently, but I think it's like six months when you're supposed to give it to children. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4640.0s)]
*  Only like 20% of parents are actually following the advice of this. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4646.0s)]
*  But it's on the child schedule. There is no study that I've seen asking whether the COVID vaccine is linked to autism. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4653.0s)]
*  Now, it was just recently put on the child schedule, so it couldn't be responsible for the autism that came before. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4660.0s)]
*  Is it linked to autism going forward? There's no specific study that's looked at that. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4666.0s)]
*  There are questions that people have about that that are not unreasonable questions. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4670.0s)]
*  And I'll say, let's just take the MMR vaccine on autism, right? I don't, I'm satisfied with the evidence personally that it doesn't cause autism. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4675.0s)]
*  It's impossible to prove a negative entirely, but like this has been sufficiently looked at. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4684.0s)]
*  And so I personally am satisfied. But there are a lot of people who disagree with me. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4688.0s)]
*  And they have kids they have to make decisions about. How do I manage that? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4694.0s)]
*  Right? Do I stand up and say, look, I'm the head director of the MH, I know better, you must listen to me. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4699.0s)]
*  Where we've lost public trust or do what I do is I say, look, I hear your concerns. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4705.0s)]
*  Let's do more studies that are more rigorous and ask the question again. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4710.0s)]
*  And so that so that you can be satisfied. I've always in my scientific career, whenever there's disagreement and there's always disagreement at the edge of science, that's the fun of science. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4719.0s)]
*  Actually, you just you disagree about like what causes water, whatever. I mean, that's the that is the fun of science. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4729.0s)]
*  When there's disagreement, those disagreements are resolved by studies, by by doing more work, doing science, by doing science, not by authority. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4734.0s)]
*  That's my philosophy for this. I don't think that I'm going to be able to persuade people simply by my authority alone. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4744.0s)]
*  And as I said, there are some open there are open questions. And and I think I want to put this outside of vaccines, because I don't think at the end of the just my guess is at the end of the day, when we look and ask what causes autism, the vaccines will be the primary cause. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4751.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be many other things that are likely to lead to the answer to why we have such a rise in large rise in autism. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4766.0s)]
*  But if you're going to do a scientific investigation of what causes autism, I don't see how you exclude hypotheses, especially hypotheses that many, many people think are the cause. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4773.0s)]
*  I mean, we just have to be open minded when we do the scientific investigation. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4784.0s)]
*  That's that's where I think the NIH can help. We can do it a very rigorous set of studies with lots of scientists, many of whom may disagree about many things, but who all agree that we should do excellent science to get an answer to this question. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4787.0s)]
*  I think one of the the message you're providing right now is so thoughtful and nuanced. I think the thing that many people are scared of in opening this can of worms, or even having this conversation in public is that it causes tremendous [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4802.0s)]
*  hesitancy or nervousness about vaccinating your children. And I'll speak for myself. I was never nervous about vaccinating our children. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4818.0s)]
*  The tenor of the conversation over the past few years, even though I feel immune to it, pun unintended, has made me be like, wait, wait, wait, am I am I doing something wrong? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4828.0s)]
*  Am I being irresponsible here? Am I like asking questions to myself that I never thought that I would ask? And that is because of a conversation, including among people who are meant to be our public health authorities that in my view are injecting a question mark, let's call it. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4838.0s)]
*  And of course, the downstream effects of that are obvious and clear and very, very, very high. What does it mean to have a conversation about, well, maybe they do, maybe they don't, we're going to look into it as the head of the animal health department. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4854.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4864.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4872.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4882.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4892.0s)]
*  That's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. I think that's a very important point. And that's because the public health authority is there because Bobby Kennedy says that's what he says in public. That's not because the public health establishment during the pandemic said many things that didn't turn out to be true or accurate, and yet fundamentally alter the lives of so many people for the worse. The authority that was used to try to address questions about the measles vaccine, for instance. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4922.0s)]
*  pandemic use successfully, that tool is no longer in the toolkit of public health authorities. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4952.0s)]
*  This is the thing I want to try to get across. We can't go back to the status quo ante because [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4958.6s)]
*  the large chunks of the American public no longer trust us. And so how do we do that? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4965.6s)]
*  What do we do? We don't can't just say you must trust us or else. We have to treat people [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4970.36s)]
*  like intelligent human beings that want the best for themselves and for their family. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4975.64s)]
*  We have to understand what our role is. Our role is to do excellent science and provide advice [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4981.4800000000005s)]
*  based on that excellent science. And that's it. And if we do that, we have some chance of regaining [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4986.92s)]
*  the trust of the American people. If we try to go back to the status quo ante from 2019 and before [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=4993.72s)]
*  and act the way we used to act, we will fail again. That question mark is not there because [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5003.88s)]
*  of Bobby Kennedy. That question mark there is because of the public health authorities [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5009.72s)]
*  in the pandemic era. I agree with you that COVID robbed public health authorities of the ability [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5013.4800000000005s)]
*  to just say trust us. That's obviously true. And I agree that the COVID lockdowns made people [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5019.88s)]
*  understandably extremely reticent to trust those authorities at all. And we cannot go back to the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5026.68s)]
*  status quo ante. That said, the movement to discredit vaccines was present. I remember editing [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5031.4800000000005s)]
*  so many op-eds at the WSJ about this. It was extremely present and an extremely strong movement [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5039.24s)]
*  well before COVID. And RFK had a very big role to play in that. So what do you make of that? And [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5045.96s)]
*  also, are you worried that families are not going to get their children vaccinated and therefore [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5052.44s)]
*  there'll be a resurgence of things like the measles while we sort of study whether or not there is, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5058.92s)]
*  in fact, a link between autism and mercury or autism in some vaccines? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5066.36s)]
*  I mean, I think you're right, Barry. I completely agree. You're right that there was a movement [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5073.0s)]
*  before the pandemic on vaccines that were more skeptical than the public health, just including [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5077.799999999999s)]
*  me. I didn't have any much worry about vaccinating my children because, again, I looked at the [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5086.5199999999995s)]
*  literature and I sort of extrapolated. That movement, I think, was even though it got a lot [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5094.6s)]
*  of attention in the news media, was actually at the margins of the actual practice of Americans. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5101.88s)]
*  The rates at which parents didn't vaccinate their children with the measles vaccine, for instance, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5110.360000000001s)]
*  was very low. And nevertheless, we would have, from time to time, big outbreaks of [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5115.96s)]
*  measles in this country. And so, you know, not always necessarily among the vaccinated. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5122.76s)]
*  So you'd have some of that. There would be some mandates. So for instance, I think California had [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5130.04s)]
*  some sort of vaccine mandate in place for children, but there would be some kind of flexibility [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5137.0s)]
*  around it so that you could sort of quietly have some fraction of the parents who were really [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5142.360000000001s)]
*  concerned not be required so the kids could nevertheless go to school. You'd have some [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5146.6s)]
*  flexibility and some humanity in the application of those mandates. The situation now is entirely [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5152.52s)]
*  different. A much larger set of people who never previously thought twice about vaccinating their [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5159.8s)]
*  children are now in a position where they say, look, I don't trust you guys anymore. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5166.200000000001s)]
*  That's the reality. And I don't think you address that with the same kind of tools that were [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5172.68s)]
*  addressed before where it's essentially relying on the authority of the people telling them to [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5179.4s)]
*  get vaccinated. You address that by being humble in front of them, by saying, look, yes, we'll take [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5183.32s)]
*  your questions seriously and we will do the studies to the best of our ability to ask those [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5188.599999999999s)]
*  questions and give you the honest answer to those studies. And we'll make the data available so you [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5195.4s)]
*  can look at it yourself. We'll enter with you in discussions about this. I think that that's the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5200.04s)]
*  only way forward. By the way, this is not just true for vaccines. This is true for things like [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5205.32s)]
*  long COVID. So many people are suffering from long COVID. How do you address it? I don't know the [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5209.88s)]
*  answer to that question. We spent $1.4 billion or some very large sum of money, the NIH, to try to [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5215.639999999999s)]
*  get an answer. We still do not have an answer. And yet there are so many patients that suffer. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5221.88s)]
*  But I'm a parent, right? And I am now going to look to you as are tens of millions of parents [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5226.76s)]
*  in this country. And I'm going to say to you, Dr. J. Bhattacharya, should I vaccinate my children? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5235.16s)]
*  Yeah. And the answer to that question is generally, I think that vaccinating your children for the [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5242.76s)]
*  measles, diphtheria, those childhood diseases is really valuable. I very firmly believe that. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5253.88s)]
*  And I would vaccinate if I had young children now. You're lucky, Barry, that you get to have [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5260.12s)]
*  young children, minor or older now. Oh, that's lucky to have them older too. But I would vaccinate [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5265.96s)]
*  them again if they were that age. But would I vaccinate with the COVID vaccine? No. I would [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5271.32s)]
*  not vaccinate a child with a COVID vaccine. It doesn't make sense. And yet the CDC continues [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5279.32s)]
*  to recommend it. I hope that people listening to this will not make decisions by themselves [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5284.04s)]
*  simply on my authority. I think those days are done. I hope that they will try to get [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5293.0s)]
*  information from a wide range of sources. And I hope those wide range of sources will rely on [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5299.96s)]
*  excellent NIH science when they're making their recommendations. And I want to provide that [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5306.36s)]
*  excellent science to answer the questions the American people have. We're never going to go [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5311.0s)]
*  back to the authority-driven sort of structure we had before. But we will eventually have, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5315.32s)]
*  and hopefully sooner rather than later, authorities that are looking at replicated data sources, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5322.5199999999995s)]
*  transparent data sources so you can check yourself if you have the inclinations of the means. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5329.24s)]
*  And so that the new generation of authorities will be making their recommendations on a firmer [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5334.52s)]
*  ground. That's unfortunate. I mean, maybe it's not so satisfying now when we're in the middle of this [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5341.0s)]
*  crisis. That's really, I don't know. I think that most people, right, and most people are busy. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5346.04s)]
*  They do not have time to do their own research. And in fact, if they did do their own research, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5353.64s)]
*  it could lead to, and I'm not saying suppress this information of fake news. I'm just saying [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5358.76s)]
*  there's so much noise out there. And so we look to people, some of us still, who, yes, there might [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5363.32s)]
*  be diminished, like think in everything you've been talking about in terms of public health [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5369.719999999999s)]
*  authorities being diminished in their ability to just say, this is the rule, follow the rule. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5374.92s)]
*  I agree with all of that. But I still think that most people want to be able to look to [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5380.36s)]
*  the head of the HHS, the head of the NIH for a clear directive on what they should do. And you're [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5385.48s)]
*  not just a Stanford professor anymore. You're a leading public health authority. And I guess I wonder, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5392.6s)]
*  do you worry that someone could listen to this conversation and say, well, maybe I don't need [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5399.72s)]
*  to get my child, give the standard vaccination schedule to my child? Well, I mean, I guess I [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5403.160000000001s)]
*  would say I'm not so worried. I think parents are generally very smart about these things. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5410.84s)]
*  And I'd say generally, one should not give medical advice to people from a podcast or even as an [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5416.4400000000005s)]
*  NIH director. The real advice is you have to understand the health needs of your child. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5426.200000000001s)]
*  If your child has specific conditions that make them vulnerable to respiratory illnesses and your [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5432.52s)]
*  pediatrician and your caregivers tell you that, then yeah, vaccinate your child for [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5438.28s)]
*  the COVID vaccine. It's not a specific one size fits all advice. The CDC has to make advice [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5446.36s)]
*  that does provide guidelines for everybody. And I think that advice should provide guidelines [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5454.759999999999s)]
*  that fit with the situation of the vast majority of people. And I think that the way that the CDC [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5459.88s)]
*  does this should reflect the uncertainty in the scientific literature around it. So they should be [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5467.32s)]
*  much more tentative about vaccines like the COVID vaccine and maybe less tentative about other [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5472.679999999999s)]
*  vaccines that have more evidence behind them. When there are holes in evidence that people point out, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5478.5199999999995s)]
*  they should be clear about those holes. You can talk about it in a way that provides guidance [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5483.5599999999995s)]
*  when you have to make a decision. Given the best information we have at the time, I suggest such and [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5490.28s)]
*  such if your child has, if your physicians that manage your child agree versus you must do this. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5495.56s)]
*  No matter what, you're going to lose your job if you don't get it. Your kid won't be able to go to [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5504.68s)]
*  school if you don't get it. Those are two very different modes of public health communication. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5507.96s)]
*  And I think that first one is much more likely to rebuild trust, especially if it's built on a solid [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5512.68s)]
*  foundation of science. My job as the NIH director is primarily to provide that solid foundation of [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5518.68s)]
*  science. It's not primarily to make recommendations. But I'm happy to try to talk with people about it [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5523.72s)]
*  in ways that are human. Just because I'm an NIH director doesn't mean I know what your child is [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5533.8s)]
*  going through and what risks they face. And so I just have to talk about it that way. I don't know [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5538.92s)]
*  any other way, Mary. One thing I also wanted to ask you about is fluoride in drinking water. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5543.400000000001s)]
*  As I understand it, putting fluoride in the drinking water to improve dental health was an idea that was [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5549.08s)]
*  basically born out of the NIH. It's been a subject of lots of matter, including lots of conspiracies [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5561.16s)]
*  for some 80 years now, including being pushed by far-right groups like the John Birch Society. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5567.5599999999995s)]
*  This has picked up steam in recent years. Utah just became the first state to ban fluoride in [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5574.04s)]
*  the drinking water. What's at stake here? Do we have to think about fluoride in the drinking water? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5580.280000000001s)]
*  Can we just drink the water and go on with our lives? That's an interesting question because I [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5587.080000000001s)]
*  do know something about the history. This used to be one of these things where if you [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5592.360000000001s)]
*  question fluoride, there's something wrong with you. You didn't understand public health well. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5595.88s)]
*  And there was a conspiracy theory around in the 50s, there was big debates about whether [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5601.240000000001s)]
*  fluoride in drinking water was used for various purposes. And the consensus of the scientific [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5606.76s)]
*  community and the public health community was that fluoride was necessary to prevent cavities. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5612.76s)]
*  Recently, in the past decade or so, there have been some research, including out of India [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5617.8s)]
*  and the United States, suggesting that fluoride in the drinking water at sufficiently high doses [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5623.320000000001s)]
*  can actually have some neurological effects, including impacts on the IQ of kids. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5628.6s)]
*  I don't know that that's replicated research, but it's research that's recently come out. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5633.8s)]
*  I think it's a really interesting point. If it is actually true that it does have this impact [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5639.08s)]
*  of IQ on kids, it's time to revisit that question. And on the flip side, in the 50s, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5645.240000000001s)]
*  I don't think fluoride was widely in toothpaste. And people were brushing teeth less. There was [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5655.56s)]
*  less focus on dental hygiene in the 50s than there is today, even for children. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5664.04s)]
*  And so the marginal benefit from including fluoride in the drinking water may be less [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5668.6s)]
*  than it was given the widespread availability of fluoride in toothpaste now. So it might be, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5672.2s)]
*  obviously Utah's revisited it. I think it is when enough people and scientific facts have changed, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5677.56s)]
*  it's time to revisit. The kinds of recommendations that public health made are not etched in stone [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5683.48s)]
*  forever. The best decisions change with the conditions of the societies. The conditions [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5689.32s)]
*  change, the advice should change. And I don't know whether that debate is going to lead. It's not my [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5695.24s)]
*  specific expertise, but I do think that it's worth having this discussion. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5700.04s)]
*  One other one I've been wanting to ask you about, and I think the broad theme here is that [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5703.48s)]
*  a lot of the things that were called conspiracies kind of turned out to be true, and not all of them, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5708.44s)]
*  and not all of them to the extent that they were pumped up. But the point is that we're living [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5714.44s)]
*  through a moment of sort of revisiting of things that were consensus, things that were conventional [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5719.48s)]
*  wisdom, questioning them, whether or not they turn out to be true. Some of those conversations [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5724.04s)]
*  feel to me quite dangerous and very high stakes. Others of them feel really necessary. One of the [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5729.16s)]
*  ones that feel necessary is the food pyramid. This was the thing that was, we grew up in school [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5734.28s)]
*  learning the food pyramid, and the bottom of that food pyramid was like, eat carbs all day long, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5738.92s)]
*  that is how you will be healthy. Fat is bad, butter is bad, meat is bad. And that seems to be [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5743.32s)]
*  something that is being in live time debunked. And I wonder how you think about that. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5749.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Barry, it's changed very rapidly. I think that the way that we're [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5755.48s)]
*  rapidly, I think the reason why it's in question now is that people have noticed that the advice [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5762.04s)]
*  that public health has given on basic things regarding nutrition has flipped back and forth [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5771.08s)]
*  over and over and over again. Are eggs good for you? Like in the 1980s, I remember my family stopped [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5776.36s)]
*  eating eggs because you weren't supposed to eat eggs. Remember the egg eaters? Yeah, then there was [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5782.44s)]
*  like, you could eat egg whites, but not yellows. And the whole thing has been, it's flipped back [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5786.44s)]
*  and forth. Dietary cholesterol is bad for you, but no, it's not bad for you. It's actually, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5791.4s)]
*  you produce endogenous cholesterol. It's the amount of fats you eat that are bad for you, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5796.5199999999995s)]
*  get rid of trans fats. I mean, a lot of the science of nutrition flips back and forth in part because [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5800.5199999999995s)]
*  it's not settled science, and it's not replicable science. And I think it's actually really, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5807.96s)]
*  I agree with you, quite a good thing that we're revisiting this. And as we revisit this, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5816.68s)]
*  we should require high standards for the scientific basis for the answers to these questions [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5822.200000000001s)]
*  about what's the right diet. And I'm not trying to give dietary advice. In fact, quite the opposite [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5828.12s)]
*  I'm trying to do is just forecast for where I think will end up happening. What will end up happening [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5835.08s)]
*  is that there won't be one piece of dietary advice that's right for every single person. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5840.280000000001s)]
*  It'll depend on your specific circumstances. Just like we talk about personalized medicine, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5844.4400000000005s)]
*  it'll be personalized diets, dietary advice. What I do know is that the diet that the American [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5848.4400000000005s)]
*  people generally have is not working. We have this massive chronic disease crisis, and there's no way [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5853.88s)]
*  that diet is not at least part of it or at least a big chunk of it. And so we need to have much [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5858.92s)]
*  better answers for people. And I think it's really good that this debate's happening. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5864.04s)]
*  You start at the NIH tomorrow. What are the top three priorities you have for your tenure? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5869.56s)]
*  Well, the first one that we've been talking about extensively, replication. I want to make [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5875.88s)]
*  replication the heart and soul of what the NIH does and make it rewarding for scientists first [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5879.4s)]
*  to do that kind of replication work that undergirds science, making it an honored part of the scientific [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5884.68s)]
*  profession. Right now, you don't get very much credit if you do replication. And then also make [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5888.84s)]
*  it part of the reward. If you publish a paper, fine, it's good. Even if it's a fancy journal, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5892.76s)]
*  but if someone else replicates your work, if you share your data with other people as a scientist, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5898.92s)]
*  that really should be rewarded. So we'll make the changes to the scientific [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5904.200000000001s)]
*  infrastructure so that replication becomes the heart and soul of what we do as scientists. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5911.0s)]
*  Second, I want to transform the NIH portfolio so that it focuses on chronic disease. We should be [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5914.92s)]
*  answering the questions that most afflict American health. I still, of course, want to have answers [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5921.4800000000005s)]
*  to the orphan diseases that are rare. We need to make sure we take care of every American, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5926.84s)]
*  but we should not be neglecting the diseases that really affect this largest number of Americans. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5933.56s)]
*  We have not done a good enough job at that. And then third, I want to make sure that the portfolio [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5938.2s)]
*  that the NIH has is at the very edge of the scientific frontier. Often over the last few [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5942.84s)]
*  decades, the NIH has been very conservative in the investments we've made. We've invested in things [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5950.2s)]
*  that we're pretty sure are going to work because they already worked before. Let's invest in things [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5954.92s)]
*  that are going to really transform how we treat every single thing we've talked about. How do you [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5958.92s)]
*  prevent infectious disease? How do you manage chronic disease? How do we cure cancer? Those are [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5964.52s)]
*  going to take new ideas from new generations of scientists and want to make sure that those new [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5970.84s)]
*  ideas are part of the NIH portfolio. Not all of them will work, but maybe one of them will. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5976.12s)]
*  If it does, it could be completely transformative. Those are the three main priorities. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5981.8s)]
*  Lacey Lange Jay, one of the things about you that comes across so clearly in this conversation, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5986.52s)]
*  and every time we've ever met or talked, and I think listeners, whether or not they are [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5991.08s)]
*  Fauci-sympathetic or Great Barrington-sympathetic will feel this way, there's a humility and a [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=5996.92s)]
*  graciousness that just comes through in your character and is so obvious throughout this [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6002.28s)]
*  conversation. You're about to work in an administration, and I don't think this is [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6009.16s)]
*  saying anything impolitic. I don't think anyone would disagree with this, that is not exactly [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6013.8s)]
*  gracious in the way that they move through the world. I think you could say, we haven't lived [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6018.5199999999995s)]
*  through the first hundred days yet, but a lot of these Trump EOs, I'm thinking specifically of the [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6024.36s)]
*  big law EOs that we're writing about in the next few days in the free press, have been deliberately [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6029.0s)]
*  intended as retribution. How do you maintain your values working, at least in part, in an [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6034.68s)]
*  administration that has a very different ethos? How are you thinking about that? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6045.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think we all need some grace, Lary, including me. I think that I can only do [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6052.04s)]
*  my part, and I'm going to be who I am, I can't be anybody else. I very firmly believe that [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6060.6s)]
*  grace spreads. It's not just the Trump administration, Barry, it's basically the [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6070.92s)]
*  American politics, essentially one of the modes of it is to divide people, to create idea that [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6076.280000000001s)]
*  there is a political other that needs to be destroyed, and it's both sides that have this. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6083.080000000001s)]
*  The solution, I think, comes from each and every person. Treat others with grace, even if they [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6089.320000000001s)]
*  disagree with you. That's the only way forward, I think. Whether that works, we'll see, I guess. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6094.84s)]
*  Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the new head of the NIH, as of tomorrow, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6101.240000000001s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on, honestly. Thank you, Barry. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1NEDhtTb8&t=6106.04s)]
