A lot of people are wondering if things in Los Angeles would look different if Rick Caruso had won the mayoral race against Karen Bass in 2022. If he had been mayor when devastating fires began in the city last month, could he have prevented them from consuming about 40,000 acres—an area twice the size of Manhattan?

At the time Caruso ran, many quietly supported the billionaire real estate mogul—scared to come out publicly for the white Boomer billionaire against the candidate (a black woman and a former physician assistant who happened to travel to Cuba eight times in the 1970s) who was backed by Barack Obama and celebrities like Shonda Rhimes and Ariana Grande.

But disaster has a way of clarifying things. And many—including the LA Times owner whose paper endorsed Bass—are expressing serious buyer’s remorse.

Does this annoy Caruso? And does he think Bass won because of her identity? If the election were held today, would things have turned out differently?

Today on Honestly, Bari sits down with Rick Caruso for a very frank conversation.

# Has California Abandoned Far-Left Politics? | Rick Caruso
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE)
*  From the Free Press, this is honestly an Einberry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of people are wondering if things in Los Angeles would look different right now, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=4.16s)]
*  if Rick Caruso had won the mayoral race against Karen Bass in 2022. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=8.64s)]
*  If he had been mayor when the devastating fires began last month, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=14.0s)]
*  would he have prevented over 20,000 acres from burning to the ground, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=17.68s)]
*  an area about two times the size of Manhattan? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=22.32s)]
*  At the time Caruso ran, many privately supported the billionaire real estate mogul, scared to come [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=26.0s)]
*  out publicly against the candidate backed by Barack Obama, Shonda Rhimes, and Ariana Grande. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=31.84s)]
*  But now many in LA are texting me saying they wish he had won, and they wish they had done [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=37.6s)]
*  more to make him win. Indeed, some of these lifelong Democrats are saying that they're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Republicans, or the very least, they're whatever Karen Bass isn't. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Caruso may have lost that race, but he's acting a lot like a de facto public official right now, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=51.44s)]
*  launching and funding a nonprofit he calls Steadfast LA. He's leveraged his connections [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=56.88s)]
*  to get everyone from Netflix to Amazon to JP Morgan to help restore critical infrastructure [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=62.32s)]
*  in the city, to rebuild homes with the help of AI, and to figure out ways to use America's most [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=68.08s)]
*  advanced technology to prevent future fires. Now everyone is watching to see what Rick Caruso [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=73.84s)]
*  does next. Will he run for mayor again? Or perhaps even governor of California? And most [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=79.92s)]
*  pressingly, can Rick Caruso figure out a way to save Los Angeles? I also ask him about ethical [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=85.6s)]
*  issues around inmates and private sector firefighters and hot button topics in California, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=91.68s)]
*  like DEI in public schools and Trump's plans for immigration. Today on Honestly, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=97.28s)]
*  all of that and much more. Stay with us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=102.8s)]
*  Lauren Henry Rick Caruso, welcome to Honestly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=109.92s)]
*  Rick Caruso Thank you for having me, Barry. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Barry [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=115.76s)]
*  during the pandemic, and not just for tax reasons, but for reasons of basic safety. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=169.92s)]
*  You know, if you live in certain neighborhoods of Los Angeles, you walk down certain streets, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=175.28s)]
*  like Market Street in San Francisco, you will be absolutely shocked. If you come from even Manhattan [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  and go to a place like that, you see people really dying on the streets of these cities. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=186.0s)]
*  And I wanted to open by asking you just a really big picture question before we get to the fires [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=191.76s)]
*  or anything going on in Los Angeles. How did this decline become normalized? Why did people, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=196.88s)]
*  including some of the most affluent people in the nation, why did they put up with it? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=204.4s)]
*  Rick Caruso Well, listen, Barry, it's a great question. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=211.2s)]
*  And you obviously paint a pretty dire picture of California. So I do want to start by saying that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=213.2s)]
*  I do think it's the greatest state. There's no doubt in my mind. And I'm a big believer in Los [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=220.16s)]
*  Angeles, and I love LA. And what I would say for both California and Los Angeles, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=225.84s)]
*  if you unleash California, if you bring in the right policies in California, Los Angeles, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=234.32s)]
*  you could only imagine the strength and the productivity and the quality of life that we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=241.6s)]
*  would have. But to answer your question, we systematically, we being people of Los Angeles [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=245.44s)]
*  and people of California systematically, elected people, either that were not qualified to run, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=252.72s)]
*  meaning they didn't have the practical experience and the common sense to really make good decisions, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=259.84s)]
*  or they had an ideology that seemed to be what people were focused on, rather than competency. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=266.08s)]
*  And this lasted for a while. And, you know, you dig into a hole on these things, and it's tough [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=273.76s)]
*  to come out of the hole. But there is a way to do it. I'm really hopeful that there's a way to do it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=279.84s)]
*  But it's going to take people that have a lot of courage, have a lot of competence, and a lot of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=285.11999999999995s)]
*  experience that are willing to get into politics, get elected, and start turning the ship around. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=290.4s)]
*  What we have to do in this state is we have to start prioritizing and in the city, prioritizing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  and asking ourselves, who do we serve? And everything we do should be in their best interest. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=304.16s)]
*  And I think we've lost sight of that. Rick, there's this concept called suicidal empathy, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=310.8s)]
*  which is essentially the notion that people become so compassionate that they stop making [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  rational decisions, and they tolerate things that have become, that should be intolerable. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  In other words, you believe that suicidal empathy would be, for example, giving out [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  extremely expensive tents, sleeping bags, and needles for people to get high and sleep outside [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=335.28s)]
*  in San Francisco. And you tell yourself, this is just being empathetic to people. But actually, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=340.8s)]
*  in effect, what you're doing is allowing people to die on the streets of your city. And I sort of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=346.56s)]
*  look big picture at some of the worst policies that have been adopted in California over the past [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  decade, maybe longer than that. But it's sort of come really, really clear over the past decade. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=357.44s)]
*  And I wonder if suicidal empathy is an accurate description of how some Democrats, not all of them, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=362.88s)]
*  have behaved in governing California. Listen, it could be very, I would maybe have a little [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=369.84s)]
*  bit different take on that. My take on that is I think most everybody approaches these problems [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  wanting to do the right thing. They have very, very different points of view of what the right [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=383.44s)]
*  thing is to get to the right conclusion. What I would challenge with a lot of people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=388.32s)]
*  who have had very, very progressive ideas, let's say of how to deal with homelessness, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=393.76s)]
*  like you were talking about, tell me what the end game is. How does this end by doing what you [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=398.56s)]
*  continue to do? And what we've seen is it doesn't end well. In fact, it actually doesn't end. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=406.4s)]
*  It just keeps going and growing. The frustration that I have, and I think most people have, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=413.44s)]
*  is that if you want to go down a path and try something, at some point you've got to judge it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=420.48s)]
*  honestly and say, is it working or not? And if it's not working, course correct. The real sin, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=427.2s)]
*  in my opinion, is a lot of our elected officials, a lot of our very prominent people just refuse [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=436.4s)]
*  to course correct. And I think we're at a point that people are now saying, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=442.56s)]
*  we demand a course correction because we don't like the path that we're on. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  SONIA DARA There's this idea of luxury beliefs that's my friend Rob Henderson defined. And it's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=450.32s)]
*  basically in the same way that luxury goods confer status or affluence, luxury beliefs do the same. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=457.12s)]
*  So if you look at the past few years, the idea, let's say, of abolishing the police, that became [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=465.2s)]
*  a high status idea to put out there in the world. But the very people that were articulating it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=470.48s)]
*  are the kinds of people that live in neighborhoods with private security. In other words, it's a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=476.32s)]
*  luxury thing that they can afford to post the hashtag, abolish the police, precisely because [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=482.32s)]
*  they live in neighborhoods where they won't suffer the consequences of those things. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=488.56s)]
*  And people kind of went along with those ideas. But the bill came due, I would argue, a few weeks [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  ago when Los Angeles suffered the worst fire in the history of the city. Exactly. And all of a sudden, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=498.96s)]
*  the things that they had indulged without necessarily suffering the consequences of it, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=513.92s)]
*  all of a sudden, people were texting me all over Los Angeles saying, I can't believe I voted for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=519.28s)]
*  Karen Bass, or I woke up the day after the fires and now I'm a Republican, half jokingly. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=524.72s)]
*  But sincerely in the sense that I went along with a set of policies and ideas and politicians [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  that I didn't suffer the consequences of, and now all of a sudden, I'm suffering the consequences [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  of incompetency and bad governance. I wonder if that's the kind of thing that you've been hearing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=543.84s)]
*  over the past few weeks and what you make of the people that, to steal a phrase, are waking up or [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=549.04s)]
*  maybe getting woke to reality. I'm hearing that a lot. Yeah, there's no question. I'm hearing it a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  lot in Los Angeles. And just to, again, sort of put your listeners and viewers, given the context, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=560.64s)]
*  the area that's been devastated, that's been burned out is two and a half times the size of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=568.24s)]
*  Manhattan in New York. It is difficult to get your head around even when you drive through it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=573.6s)]
*  It's so devastating. It literally looks like it was carpet bombed. And I do think that people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  woke up with a very different feeling about their leadership, woke up about their priorities. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=588.16s)]
*  And this is very personal to me. It's personal because I love this city. It's personal because [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=594.88s)]
*  my son and my daughter lost a home. It's personal to me because these two wonderful communities, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=602.4s)]
*  Altadena and the Palisades, it's more about losing your home. They lost their lifestyle. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  They lost their gathering places, churches, schools, parks. Everything's gone. And to me, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=615.36s)]
*  the level of incompetence of the leadership, both elected and appointed, is like nothing I've ever [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=623.6s)]
*  seen. And everybody is paying a huge price for it. And nobody yet, which boggles my mind, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=630.72s)]
*  has stood up and said, I take responsibility and I'm sorry. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  Who are the people that should be standing up and doing exactly that? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=645.36s)]
*  Well, the first in line should be Karen Bass. And then down from her, the head of DWP that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=649.44s)]
*  allowed the reservoir that backs up and fills up the water for the fire hydrants was empty. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=656.96s)]
*  And literally the fire department ran out of water. The second largest city in the country. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  How the hell do you run out of water in your fire hydrants? She should be fired immediately. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=668.0s)]
*  And it goes from there. The fire department was not pre-deployed. We had a fire three weeks ago. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=674.88s)]
*  The catastrophic winds, there was notices going out to everybody about how deadly, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=681.36s)]
*  quote unquote, these winds were going to be. You had 40 years of brush that had never been managed. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  So you had all of these facts coming together. It was predictable. And what I've said before, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  what's predictable is preventable. And we just weren't prepared for it. And that's wrong. And [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  people should be held accountable for it. Now, I've been very clear in my criticism, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=705.44s)]
*  Barry, as you know, and I also do want to give people hope because I'm very hopeful looking [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  forward and we can talk about that. But, you know, what's happened happened. People should be held [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=716.24s)]
*  accountable. But now the focus and my focus is let's get people back in their community, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  back in their homes, back in their schools, back in their synagogues, back in their churches. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to work my ass off every day to do it. And that's what I'm doing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=733.44s)]
*  I want to get there because, you know, as you know, I'm married to a seventh generation Californian. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  California is in her blood. She has made me fall in love with the state and I'm also long California. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=743.7600000000001s)]
*  But I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the reality of how the fires happen, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=749.44s)]
*  because for people who don't live in LA, who don't live in these communities, there's a lot [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=755.6s)]
*  of information, like the information flow around how this devastation happened is very confusing [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=760.96s)]
*  because there's a lot of fake news out there and information that it's unclear if it's true or [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  conspiracy. So, you know what happened better than just about anybody. How did this happen? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  As you just said before, you can't prevent deadly winds. California in many ways is, I don't want [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=781.76s)]
*  to say built to burn, but it's the kind of environment where fires happen, where earthquakes [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=788.64s)]
*  happen. These things happen. They are not preventable. What is preventable is preparation [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=793.92s)]
*  for them. So, explain to people that have not been following the ins and outs of everything in the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=799.76s)]
*  way that you have, like big picture, how did this level of devastation happen? How did it come to be [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=807.12s)]
*  that an area two and a half times the size of Manhattan burned to the ground? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=814.56s)]
*  Well, it starts with we had no management of the hillsides with the brush. And like I said, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  that had been there for 40 years. Six years ago, our home is in Brentwood, which is about 15 minutes [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=826.8s)]
*  in the Palisades. Six years ago, we had a fire near Brentwood on the 405 freeway. And at the time, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=832.4s)]
*  very sadly, I said to my wife and my kids, because we were evacuated from Brentwood, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  if that fire starts traveling west and gets into the Palisades, it's going to roar down the mountain [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=842.48s)]
*  right into the Palisades and wipe out the town. And at the time, I called Garcetti and a whole [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  bunch of city officials saying, we got to clear this brush out. Garcetti being the mayor at the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=852.32s)]
*  time. Garcetti being the mayor at the time. And a lot of excuses why that can't be done. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=857.2s)]
*  And a lot of people were raising hell about that. So, you have the fuel. That was the fuel. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=863.04s)]
*  You have the fire department that's been underfunded for at least 10 to 15 years. We have [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=869.44s)]
*  equipment that is mothballed sitting in yards. They can't be used because they don't have the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=875.12s)]
*  mechanics to have them repaired so they can operate. That's a sin. And on top of it, Mayor [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=880.88s)]
*  Bass cut their funding even more this year. So, they were completely underfunded and the chief [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=888.88s)]
*  was very clear. Publicly, this is going to impact our ability to keep people safe. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=893.92s)]
*  For some reason, the fire department did not deploy early. They should have been stationed [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=900.4799999999999s)]
*  in these areas knowing we had a fire about three weeks ago in almost the same exact spot where [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=904.56s)]
*  this fire started. May have been the same exact spot. You have the reservoir that's empty. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=911.04s)]
*  That reservoir supplies the fire hydrant. So, at 1030 at night on Tuesday, I get a call from one [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  of my senior people that was in the command center that said, your daughter's house just [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=922.64s)]
*  burned. As they were trying to protect the homes on her block, they ran out of water. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=929.36s)]
*  I couldn't imagine how you run out of water. Well, they didn't manage the water supply properly. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=934.8s)]
*  So, all of these problems compounded. And of course, you had the winds. They were moving [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=942.0s)]
*  the embers along and it was very tough to control. But I really do believe if it couldn't [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=947.52s)]
*  have been completely prevented, it certainly could have been very, very mitigated and much [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=952.88s)]
*  less damage here. It's the most frustrating, angering feeling as you go through that community [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=958.16s)]
*  to look at the impact on so many lives. There's now an additional estimate of over 100,000 people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=965.84s)]
*  that are homeless. If Karen Bass were sitting here and we said to her, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=974.0s)]
*  why did you allow the fire department to go underfunded? What's the steel man argument for [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=978.64s)]
*  why that was allowed to happen? You really got to ask her that. I was so clear when I was running [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=985.28s)]
*  for mayor and one of the videos that I had made when I was running for mayor talked about fully [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=991.2s)]
*  funding the fire department and the police department for that matter. So that we have [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=996.64s)]
*  services like paramedics. Let me tell you, you know what the busiest fire station is in the United [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1001.12s)]
*  States? No, tell me. It's called Fire Station Number 11. This serves MacArthur Park. You know [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1007.28s)]
*  why it's so busy? It's not responding to fires. It's responding to overdoses in the neighborhood [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1014.72s)]
*  because of the amount of drugs on the streets. I mean, MacArthur Park right now, and like many [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  other parts of the city, are completely overtaken by these poor souls, homeless, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1026.96s)]
*  drug addicted, the sale of drugs are open on the streets and that's why they're so busy. Our [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1034.16s)]
*  priorities have just gotten so sideways in the city of LA and we got to correct that. But you'd [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1041.52s)]
*  have to ask her that question. Rick, one of the things that's happened in the aftermath of these [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1048.08s)]
*  fires is that a lot of people who are really annoyed at California and enraged about the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1052.72s)]
*  incompetency in LA were saying that niche environmental concerns allowed this catastrophe [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1058.08s)]
*  to happen. And I want you to bring some sense of proportion and help make sense of this for me. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1064.48s)]
*  Tell me if it's been overblown or not. Did concerns over, say, protecting the smelt fish or [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1070.4s)]
*  protecting this weed I had never heard of called a milk vetch? If you go online right now or for the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1076.72s)]
*  past few weeks, everyone has been talking about the milk vetch and the smelt fish and I can't [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1082.48s)]
*  really get a handle on whether or not these criticisms are overblown or not. What do you think? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1088.32s)]
*  I can't tell you precisely, but what I can tell you is, in my opinion, the priority always has to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1093.76s)]
*  be the safety and the quality of life for the human beings and the residents and everything [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1099.92s)]
*  else should come second. The big question that I don't have an answer to, maybe you can look [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1105.52s)]
*  into it, I think most of that mountain range behind the Palisades is controlled by the Santa [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1110.88s)]
*  Monica Conservancy. And the Santa Monica Conservancy is a very strong political force. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  And I would imagine, I could be wrong, but I would imagine that they probably had a lot of resistance [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1122.48s)]
*  to brush management back there and elected officials or whatnot, you know, did not want to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1128.8000000000002s)]
*  take them on. But I do think that many environmental concerns need to be measured [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1134.88s)]
*  against the safety of people. I mean, that's just common sense. And if people's safety is at risk, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1140.96s)]
*  that's the priority, period, end of story. Let's talk a little bit about the response [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1147.5200000000002s)]
*  to the fires. About a thousand of the firefighters deployed to Los Angeles last month were [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1154.16s)]
*  incarcerated prisoners. They are paid a good deal less than the minimum wage they earn [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1159.44s)]
*  about six to $10 a day, although during the LA fires, some made around $30 a day. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1164.64s)]
*  And while the program is voluntary, it's been criticized because of the dangerous work and [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1170.72s)]
*  the lack of firefighting opportunities for prisoners once they're released. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1176.16s)]
*  What do you think about the ethics of that? I don't know all the ins and outs of that program, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  but I don't have a problem with that. And from what I've read, Barry, they've actually did a very [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1184.24s)]
*  good job and worked very hard out there. I mean, it's clear statewide, we need more firefighters. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1188.48s)]
*  What has come out is that there have been bills to hire more statewide firefighters that were [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  vetoed. We need to turn that around. We need more firefighters in LA. For sure we do. I'll just give [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1200.8000000000002s)]
*  you a perspective here again on this. If you take 1965 until today, the population of Los Angeles [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1208.64s)]
*  has more than doubled. We have about the same amount of firefighters and we actually have less [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  fire stations. That's insane. It's insane. And so- Where is that money gone? Rick, where did the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1223.36s)]
*  money go? That's a really good- Listen, we're spending billions of dollars on homeless with no [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1231.6s)]
*  results, by the way. In the city of Los Angeles alone, we got over 40,000 homeless. I think county [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1236.9599999999998s)]
*  wide is 70,000, 80,000 homeless. So there's billions and billions going into it. We're not [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1242.4799999999998s)]
*  building anything. We're not building new housing. The bond measure that was approved for housing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1248.4s)]
*  Triple H, we were supposed to build 10,000 homes over the last 10 years. We barely built 1,000 [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1254.16s)]
*  at an average of 800,000 a unit. I mean, it's the mismanagement and the priorities are just upside [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  down, as simple as that. The other person who's strangely gone unmentioned so far in this conversation [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1271.8400000000001s)]
*  is the current governor of California, Gavin Newsom, who many people thought wins at his back, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1277.6s)]
*  could be the candidate in 2028. And things look very, very different after the fire. What's your [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  view of how he has handled the past few weeks? Well, I've actually been spending a lot of time [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1289.6s)]
*  with Gavin and talking to Gavin frequently. And he came by my office last week. I will tell you, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1294.7199999999998s)]
*  my view of Gavin is he's working very hard to try to do the right thing. And I think he's made some [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1300.6399999999999s)]
*  good moves. He just made a move on changing insurance proceeds, collecting interest, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1305.6s)]
*  which is important for people. He very quickly lifted a lot of restrictions. And he's been very [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1310.48s)]
*  open to my suggestions and was sitting in my office and taking notes on what to do. So [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1316.56s)]
*  I think he's realized he's got to work with the president and flying to Washington was the right [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1323.36s)]
*  thing to do. This is bigger than politics right now and just deal with it. So I really don't have [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1328.56s)]
*  a criticism of Gavin on response to this. I want to be really clear because I'm not trying to give [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1335.76s)]
*  anybody a pass. This is a local failure. Every department and institution that failed in protecting [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1342.08s)]
*  the city was under the direct authority of the mayor of Los Angeles. They all report to her directly. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1351.6s)]
*  Nobody else. So it's easy to pin it on Gavin or pin it on the state legislature, whatnot. And there's [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1358.8s)]
*  enough fault of things to go around to everybody on certain issues. But what we need in Los Angeles [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  now going forward is the right energy and leadership and commitment to rebuild quickly [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  and rebuild it right. And I'm really worried about that because I think people are going to take an [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1383.28s)]
*  easy path and we're not going to rebuild right. This is a generational opportunity to do something [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1387.28s)]
*  really great for these communities. And that's what we have to be focused on. You ran for mayor [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1393.2s)]
*  in 2022. You lost to Karen Bass by some 90,000 votes. You're obviously, well, I think you're [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1398.56s)]
*  obviously very competent. Bass arguably is not. Why do you think you lost that race? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1406.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know. The timing may not have been right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1411.2s)]
*  And you know, Karen was a very popular, likeable figure. I mean, when she first announced and I [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1418.56s)]
*  was in the race and then I announced, I think my rating was about three or four percent. At this [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1424.64s)]
*  point, she started out in the thirties. I had to work very hard to catch up, spend a lot of money [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1429.8400000000001s)]
*  to catch up and get my name out there. But, you know, there's also a good chunk of Los Angeles that [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1435.76s)]
*  is very progressive. And, you know, her message [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1443.12s)]
*  resonated with them more than my message did. If you look at the heat map of who voted in Los Angeles [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1448.16s)]
*  for Karen versus me, I mean, it's really a divided city when you take a look at it. And so, you know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1453.92s)]
*  who knows? But I loved every minute running and I'm glad I did. And it was a great family experience. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  And I got to love the city even more than I did before running. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1468.48s)]
*  Do you think you lost because of identity politics? Do you think you lost because you're a wealthy [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  white guy? Well, listen, her and her team love trying beat me up that, you know, I was like a [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1479.6s)]
*  Donald Trump and all that kind of thing. We couldn't be more different in many ways. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1488.32s)]
*  And so, listen, I think they took very cheap shots, but I think politics is a dirty game. But [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1492.72s)]
*  here's what else happened. What else happened is the Democratic Party, it's a closed loop system. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1499.2s)]
*  And they did not want to have an outsider coming in. And they worked really hard. You know, Biden [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1507.04s)]
*  flew out and campaigned for her. Pelosi did. Bernie did. The whole group did. And at the very [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1512.72s)]
*  end, when I was still running ahead, they convinced Obama to lean in, which originally he had stayed [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  out of it until the last 10 days. I mean, that's a hell of a lot of effort to try to win. But they [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1528.4s)]
*  were successful. And I think what people see now is that we need to have a different scorecard [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1534.24s)]
*  for people taking office. What I thought was interesting in that race is a lot of the heavy [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1541.28s)]
*  hitters inside LA, celebrities and others were endorsing you, but people on the outside, like [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1546.1599999999999s)]
*  the Democratic machine were endorsing her. Elon Musk, he's since changed his Twitter name to a [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1550.8s)]
*  name I will not say. I believe it's Harry Balls. There I said it. But Elon Musk, he literally did [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  that a few hours ago so that people on CNN would have to say it. But Elon Musk tweeted, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1563.2s)]
*  Obama made sure that Rick Caruso, who's extremely competent, lost to the utterly [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1569.76s)]
*  incompetent Mayor Karen, her real name. Do you broadly agree with that sentiment? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  Listen. Rick, the show's called Honestly. Listen, I honestly believe that we had a, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1581.52s)]
*  listen, we had a tough campaign. I think Obama definitely had an impact. He's a powerful [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1591.36s)]
*  figure. And he's a beloved figure in Los Angeles. So his opinion mattered. And I don't know what [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1598.48s)]
*  his opinion would be today. But, you know, at the time his opinion mattered, it certainly didn't [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1606.48s)]
*  help me. So sure, it was a hit to me. When that came out, I was, you know, pretty taken back by it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1611.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you think Karen Bass should be recalled? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1620.08s)]
*  I really think I'm not trying to avoid this question at all. I really think she's got to [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1622.08s)]
*  figure that out herself. I think it's one of these moments in time where you've got to really [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1629.28s)]
*  look deep inside your soul and say, Am I the right person at the right time to do this? Because [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1635.76s)]
*  it's one thing to screw up being prepared. And I would love to know her calendar and how many [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1642.56s)]
*  meetings she had with department heads before she left the country, knowing these wins were coming. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1650.32s)]
*  You know, how are you prepared? What are you doing? Let me review the plan. How many of those meetings [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1657.4399999999998s)]
*  did she have? So she obviously failed on that front. We have the results of that. The rebuilding [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1662.0s)]
*  effort is massive and complicated. And I really think she has to ask herself, Am I prepared for [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1672.3999999999999s)]
*  this? But this is the thing that, so we lived in LA for the past four years and loved it. But the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1678.88s)]
*  thing that I could not wrap my mind around is I paid taxes, I looked at those numbers, and I saw [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1684.3200000000002s)]
*  the kind of services that people just didn't even come to expect. I mean, for example, in our [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1690.96s)]
*  neighborhood, if you called the police and there were robberies on almost every home in our [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  neighborhood, and that was considered just part of life in Los Angeles, again, coming from the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1703.2800000000002s)]
*  outside, it was shocking what people had normalized. So not only are you paying the highest taxes of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1708.24s)]
*  anywhere in the country, but the police don't come for an hour when you call. And so in addition to [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1714.64s)]
*  paying those taxes, you're also paying essentially retired police officers who actually show up when [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1720.64s)]
*  you call. This was the kind of thing that was normalized in a middle class, upper middle class [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1727.04s)]
*  neighborhood of Los Angeles. And I don't understand from a just human nature perspective, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1731.52s)]
*  why there hasn't been more of a political revolt on the part of people living in the city. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1738.48s)]
*  I actually think so many people in the city of Los Angeles feel defeated. They don't feel like [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1744.24s)]
*  they're listened to or have a choice. I think the far left has been so loud that people just say, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1749.12s)]
*  I don't want to take on the fight. I don't want to take on the argument. And I think that has really [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1757.76s)]
*  changed very, I think people are very vocal now. They have permission to say how they feel. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1762.8s)]
*  These fires really did send a shockwave through so many people. But to your point, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1769.28s)]
*  the police department is so underfunded. We do not have enough officers on the street. And that's [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1776.08s)]
*  been going on for years. And we've got to start hiring, we got to redeploy, we got to protect our [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1781.9199999999998s)]
*  neighborhoods. This is basic stuff when you're running a city. Clean streets, safety, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1787.52s)]
*  deal with the homeless situation, it can all be solved if you have the right priorities. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1793.92s)]
*  And you got some backbone, and you have some common sense, and you got some experience, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1799.04s)]
*  you know how to run an organization. You know the famous Rahm Emanuel line about never letting a [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1804.24s)]
*  serious crisis go to waste. Yeah. And the crisis are an opportunity to do things you couldn't do [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1810.08s)]
*  before. What are the things that were not sayable or doable before these fires that are now sayable [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1815.36s)]
*  and doable? I think just what we're talking about, that we want to have more police and we want to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  actually to be police and allow them to engage and prevent crime in all of the best ways. I mean, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1827.12s)]
*  years ago, when I was the police commissioner, we had a similar situation going on. So this is over [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1833.6799999999998s)]
*  20 years ago. Crime was steadily rising. We had police leaving the police department. We couldn't [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1839.2s)]
*  hire enough in the academy. And I fired a very popular chief of police that was not a politically [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  correct thing to do. And brought in what I believed, and he turned out to be one of the best cops in [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1854.24s)]
*  America, Bill Bratton, out of where you're at now. And Bill came in and we built a team around Bill, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  and together we reduced crime in Los Angeles to levels not seen since 1950. I've worked for three [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1867.76s)]
*  mayors and I worked for Tom Bradley, Dick Reardon and Jim Hahn. I really have a good feeling of what [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1875.28s)]
*  good leadership in a city is about and also how much can be accomplished. That's what gives me hope. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1882.56s)]
*  If people now in this city have said, we've had enough, we want to have really smart leaders, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1889.36s)]
*  common sense and experience, things can turn around very quickly. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1895.44s)]
*  Let's broaden out beyond the fires and talk about some other issues that I think are big in Los [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1900.16s)]
*  Angeles and California more generally. One of those things is education and schools in LA, as you know, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1905.68s)]
*  have become pretty obsessed with DEI and equity initiatives. I want to just give you one example. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1912.72s)]
*  The LA Unified School District approved LA's Black Student Achievement Plan and that cost about 120 [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1918.24s)]
*  million dollars. This was meant to narrow the achievement gap between black students and other [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1925.12s)]
*  students, but there is an insane achievement gap in the LA schools. 75% of black boys in LA failed [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1929.84s)]
*  to meet basic reading standards. About 56% of graduating seniors were deemed not prepared [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1937.36s)]
*  for college or post-secondary careers. What do you think about how that money has been spent? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1944.0s)]
*  Was that all you were criticizing before? How much money has gone to homelessness? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1950.64s)]
*  So much money has gone to these kinds of initiatives without a lot of payoff. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1955.6s)]
*  If you were king for a day or frankly mayor of Los Angeles, what would you do to address what I [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1960.4s)]
*  see as like a core competency of government? A core role of government is to educate kids in [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1967.2s)]
*  public schools. That's not happening. How would you fix it? Well, LA Unified has been a problem [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1972.96s)]
*  for years and it doesn't report to the mayor directly. It's independent of the mayor, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1978.32s)]
*  but the mayor has a bully pulpit and has influence and people have tried to influence it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1985.2s)]
*  My position is really clear on it. We're spending almost more money per student than any state [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1989.28s)]
*  in the United States and I think we're ranked maybe 50% in terms of success. So our money isn't [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=1995.76s)]
*  being spent well. I think LA Unified is too big. It needs to be broken up. It needs to be more [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2001.6s)]
*  reflective of the communities they serve and they need to be rewarded on success. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2006.8s)]
*  My wife and I spend an enormous amount of time and money in communities that are at or below [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2012.96s)]
*  the poverty level, mostly black and brown communities supporting the Catholic school system [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2019.36s)]
*  that has incredible results with much, I mean a fraction of the budget. And it's incredible what [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2025.84s)]
*  these kids do when given the opportunity, the right mentorship, the right education, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2032.72s)]
*  the right programs. I mean we have kids that are living literally in housing projects on the floor [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  because the crime is so bad they worry about bullets coming through the window at night [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2045.76s)]
*  that wake up and go to school in South LA and Watts and we start taking them in this program [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2050.48s)]
*  called Operation Progress, starting from the third grade all the way through college. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  And we have kids at Harvard, Yale, USC, UCLA, MIT. So the success rate can happen. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2062.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a great school in Watts that's literally three blocks away from a public school. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2070.64s)]
*  The Catholic high school, Urban Day, has a 100% graduation rate, has a 100% of their kids when [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2078.08s)]
*  they graduate go to a junior or a full university where the public school down the street I think is [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2085.6s)]
*  somewhere around 25%. How can that be? Same neighborhood, same school area, but the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2093.04s)]
*  programs aren't working. So that does need to be changed and the governor has a big influence on [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2101.92s)]
*  that even though again LA Unified is separately run and the people that are running it, they're [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2107.36s)]
*  elected, they need to be held accountable. So I think there's terrible mismanagement of the money. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2113.28s)]
*  To me, I've been a supporter of school choice for my entire adult life and I've probably written, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2118.5600000000004s)]
*  I've at least edited hundreds of op-eds on that topic, read so many white papers and then all of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  a sudden COVID happens and COVID in six months did more to advance that movement, that educational [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  worldview, than all of those op-eds and white papers combined. Do you think that that has become [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2141.68s)]
*  school choice something that is not an R or a D issue but is just a parental rights issue in this country? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  I think there's nothing more important than educating our youth, nothing more important. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2155.68s)]
*  I think every parent should have a choice in how their child gets educated and I don't think it's [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  an R issue or a D issue. I think it's a mom and dad issue or a mom and mom issue or a dad and dad [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2165.6s)]
*  issue. Whoever the parents are, we need to give parents the ability to decide how they educate [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2172.96s)]
*  their children and I tell you what else will happen if you do that. Public schools will become more [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2180.0s)]
*  productive and they'll start using their money more wisely and they'll make sure that priorities [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2185.44s)]
*  are set. Listen, I think teachers are saints and we've got to take better care of our teachers [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2191.12s)]
*  and how we pay them and how we're they're living and we have to have workforce housing close to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2197.12s)]
*  the schools and they're not driving home two hours. I mean there's a lot of things that we could change [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2202.3199999999997s)]
*  that just elevates the whole education system but we're certainly not doing anywhere near the job [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2207.6s)]
*  we should be doing for our kids. I don't know if you're aware of this but last July California [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2214.56s)]
*  passed a law that prevents schools from requiring staff to notify parents if a student [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2220.16s)]
*  identifies as LGBTQ. In other words, you can transition at school and your parents might [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2226.96s)]
*  not know about it. You can be, you know, Sally at home and Ethan at school and people and teachers [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2233.6s)]
*  are concealing this from families. What do you think about that and do you think that there's [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2241.52s)]
*  like things like that that seems so normal over the past few years? I think now over the past few [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2247.76s)]
*  months seem like nonsense to people or worse than nonsense. Something that is profoundly [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  disrespectful to the rights of parents and families. Yeah, I think it's very wrong. I think [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2259.76s)]
*  what's wrong is anytime you get in between the relationship of a parent and a child and having [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  raised four children like all parents, raising children in today's world is a complicated thing [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2272.56s)]
*  to be doing anyway and the relationship between the parent, the teacher, the school and the child [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2278.64s)]
*  is sacrosanct and nothing should get in between the parent and child. Okay, let's move from [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2284.56s)]
*  education and talk about another huge issue in California which is immigration. As we both know [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2290.24s)]
*  and as everyone listening knows, the Trump administration ran in part on a promise to deport [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2295.68s)]
*  millions of undocumented immigrants in this country. This is a problem in California where [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2301.8399999999997s)]
*  the agriculture industry, 50 billion dollars, depends hugely on undocumented immigrants who [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2307.9199999999996s)]
*  I think make up like at least half of the state's farm workers. Many of those people are now [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
*  reportedly in hiding because they're scared to go to work in Kern County, a major agricultural hub. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2320.24s)]
*  There's a report that there's absentee rates of workers of up to 75%. Talk to me about how you [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2327.6000000000004s)]
*  would advise the president on this issue and how you are advising Governor Newsom and others about [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2336.48s)]
*  how they should be relating to the president on this issue. Well, they certainly should be talking [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2343.28s)]
*  to him and relating to him. Here's my feeling. My grandparents on both sides, my maternal and [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2347.84s)]
*  paternal grandparents, came through Ellis Island, came to this country with nothing. I think they [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2354.0s)]
*  were around 16, 17, 18 years old. My grandfather, for example, was a gardener, lived in Boyle Heights [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2358.56s)]
*  in a rented house and raised three sons along with my grandmother. So I have great respect [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2365.12s)]
*  for people that come to this country and work hard and build a life. I think we should be respecting [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2373.28s)]
*  that. There should be a path to citizenship in this country. We need the workers. We need to [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2379.44s)]
*  celebrate the people that work really hard and our economy, quite frankly, needs that. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2385.2000000000003s)]
*  At the same time, I think when people are coming into this country trying to do bad things or have [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2390.8s)]
*  a criminal record, they should be sent home, absolutely sent home. And we shouldn't be [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2397.04s)]
*  subsidizing them to live in this country or in the city or in the state. So I have a dual path [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2403.36s)]
*  here. And it does bother me and worry me that we've got a lot of good, hardworking people [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2410.96s)]
*  that are scared to death right now. And I think we should be sending them the message, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  you're going to be okay. And we're going to give you a path to citizenship and continue to work [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  and raise your family and do the right thing. Because when I think of them, I think of my [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2426.08s)]
*  grandparents and I would be out there supporting them. But I would not get in the way of deporting [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2430.8s)]
*  people who have criminal backgrounds. We've got, and just to put a pin in it, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  as you know from living in Los Angeles, we have gangs from El Salvador and gangs from Chile [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2444.0800000000004s)]
*  in the city of Los Angeles that on a daily basis are wreaking hell for people. Murder, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2450.48s)]
*  drug dealing, robbing homes at night. A friend of ours just got robbed the other night by a Chilean [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2459.28s)]
*  gang. We had a friend that was coming home, a friend of a very close friend coming home. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2466.0s)]
*  They tried to, they followed him in his driveway. They tried to steal his watch. When he fought back, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  they shot him and he died 30 days later. There's real violence and real problems that need to be [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2477.36s)]
*  solved. And so I agree that we want them out of this country. The climate though is creating such [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2484.0s)]
*  an atmosphere of fear that hardworking undocumented immigrants who have been paying taxes, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2491.28s)]
*  who've had children that were born in this country, are not showing up to work. Are you nervous about [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2496.72s)]
*  what the follow-on effects will be? Just purely thinking about the agricultural workers? Of course [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2502.88s)]
*  I do. I do worry about it. I worry about what's happening in their home. I mean, think about it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2508.88s)]
*  The fear and the scare, you have a family, you're sending your child to school and you're [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2514.64s)]
*  worried about being rounded up. Again, I think the mayor and of these cities throughout California [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2519.36s)]
*  and the governor should come out and make a clear distinction. We're going to support the people that [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2526.48s)]
*  are good hardworking people of our state or our city, but we're not going to get in the way [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2531.68s)]
*  of having criminals rounded up and taken out of the country. Your position is a nuanced one, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2537.28s)]
*  making a really, really bright line distinction between criminals and hardworking people that [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2543.36s)]
*  have contributed, certainly economically, to this country. Trump is talking about mass deportation, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2548.88s)]
*  deporting more than 10 million people. Is that wrong? Yeah, I don't agree with that. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2554.8s)]
*  I agree with deporting the criminals. I'm really clear on this and I'd love to debate it with him [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2560.88s)]
*  or anybody else because what is the goal of that versus giving somebody a pathway to citizenship, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2567.2s)]
*  paying their taxes, building their life, being a part of a productive society? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2577.2s)]
*  I mean, that's how we all got here, by the way. We didn't land from Mars. We all came [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2582.96s)]
*  through some form or fashion of immigration here. And thank God when my grandparents did it, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2590.96s)]
*  there was a path to that. And we should be doing the same thing now on a more robust level. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2597.4399999999996s)]
*  And let me just add one other thing being that for a long time being the chair of USC, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2602.48s)]
*  which really gets me riled up. The fact that we don't have a system in this country [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2606.8799999999997s)]
*  that encourages and retains highly educated college graduates, they lose their student visa, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2613.6s)]
*  we're educating them here and then sending them back. And I just think that's ridiculous. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2622.96s)]
*  Let's keep really smart, really talented people here in the United States so we can be really [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2629.92s)]
*  competitive and continue to be on the top of our game and have a great economy. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about politics for a minute. For those who don't know this, you were a Republican [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2639.04s)]
*  until 2011 when you became an independent. Then you became a Republican again in 2016 to vote [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2643.52s)]
*  for John Kasich in the primaries. Then you became an independent in 2019. And finally, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2649.28s)]
*  you became a Democrat in 2022. Why do you keep switching parties? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2654.0800000000004s)]
*  I wanted to be like Bloomberg, I guess. At the time I left the Republican Party, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2658.6400000000003s)]
*  I just felt like there was things going on I didn't fully agree with. And I wanted to be [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2666.88s)]
*  independent because I've always been the same. Like I said earlier in the show, I'm physically [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2670.5600000000004s)]
*  very conservative and I'm socially very liberal. And I wasn't finding a home in the Democratic [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2676.0s)]
*  Party or the Republican Party for that. So I became independent. California's got this [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2680.96s)]
*  weird system. If you're independent, you can't vote in the primary. So when I wanted to support [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2685.6s)]
*  John, who I thought was a good candidate, I had to flip back in order to have a vote. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2691.04s)]
*  And then after I voted, I left the Republican Party again. But when I ran for mayor, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2699.12s)]
*  if I had to choose, the Democratic Party was someplace I felt home, as long as I could be [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2707.44s)]
*  really moderate and keep my views. And I didn't realize the whole party was going to come out [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2713.68s)]
*  after me. And I thought it was ridiculous, but it's not going to change my views. I'm never going [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2719.68s)]
*  to compromise my values or my views for any party. But why, Rick, is I think we would both agree [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2725.44s)]
*  that centrism and moderation is not in right now. People don't seem to want it. They seem to want [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2734.16s)]
*  more extreme version of things, the strong version of the argument. Can centrism make a comeback? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2746.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I think it is. I think people are looking for somebody who is center-right, center-left, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2753.36s)]
*  is within this range that is comfortable reaching to the right or reaching to the left to build [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2762.1600000000003s)]
*  consensus. I think the extremes are gone. I think the extreme right and I think the extreme left, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2768.1600000000003s)]
*  I just wish they would sort of go away. Do you see Trump as a moderate figure? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2776.88s)]
*  I think Trump, when you really take a look at a lot of his policies and what he's trying to do, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2780.8s)]
*  I don't think some are maybe a little bit extreme, immigration for sure. But on the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2788.0s)]
*  business side, I don't think they're extreme. I think they're more practical, pragmatic. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2795.76s)]
*  Lincoln was a pragmatist. I think being a pragmatist is really important in life. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2801.76s)]
*  Life. So I would really like to have elected officials that don't worry about what their party [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  position is, what sits back and says, what's best for my constituents and what I'm going to do. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2813.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's where people want to have their elected officials right now. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2820.3999999999996s)]
*  One of the things that I think is astonishing as a political junkie, and I saw Mark Halpern give a [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2823.8399999999997s)]
*  really good interview about this the other day, is the amount of energy on the political right [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2828.48s)]
*  now. The amount that has been done just in the past three weeks is astonishing. It just is, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2834.3199999999997s)]
*  even if you disagree with it. And then you look at the other side and it's like, there's no players [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2839.84s)]
*  on the field. The Democrats are just vanished. And the ones that are there and making a noise, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2844.88s)]
*  and I don't mean this in an ageist way, are like Chuck Schumer and Maxine Waters, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2852.0s)]
*  like shaking their fist outside of the Treasury Department, I believe it was the other day. It's [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2856.56s)]
*  just really, really bad brand. If you're advising the Democrats, what would you advise them to make [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2861.44s)]
*  their brand and their message about? Because right now, I don't think they have one at all. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2869.36s)]
*  Well, the first thing I think they should do is all the old guards should just retire. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2873.6s)]
*  Thank you for your service. We appreciate it. But it's time for the next generation to come up. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2877.92s)]
*  There's a lot of great young, hardworking, good Democrats in the system. There's a lot of great [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2883.04s)]
*  young Republicans in the system. The next generation has to come. I'd give the same [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2889.28s)]
*  advice on the Republican side. I mean, we have people that have turned being an elected official [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2894.6400000000003s)]
*  into a lifetime job. It was never intended to be a lifetime job. And so I think they need to go away. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2900.0800000000004s)]
*  So Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer should both retire? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2906.88s)]
*  Yes. There's so many good people out there. Go away and let the next generation bubble up. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2909.84s)]
*  And so I've said to people in leadership and the Democratic Party, they need to rally around and [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2918.16s)]
*  find a good leader and a good leader that's moderate and a good leader that can bring people [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2926.96s)]
*  together and a good leader that actually says, despite my feelings on Donald Trump, I'm going [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2931.04s)]
*  to work with him because he's the president. And I look back on the years where you had Reagan [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2937.52s)]
*  and you had him constantly reaching across the aisle. You got to get back to that. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2944.7200000000003s)]
*  I think, listen, I think Bill Clinton did it. He did a lot of good by doing that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2952.88s)]
*  Who are the people out there that you find promising? Name a few names. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2957.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I like Shapiro. I'd like to get to know him more. Whitmer, I like. I spent some [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2962.96s)]
*  time with Pritzker. I think he's a very smart, balanced guy. You know, off the top of my head, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2970.96s)]
*  those three as governors, I think have done a really good job. I supported George Whiteside [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2980.7200000000003s)]
*  in here in Los Angeles. He made it to Congress. He's a very moderate Democrat. He was actually [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2987.76s)]
*  with the president for the press briefing out of the Palisades, and I thought he spoke very well. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2994.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of them out there. There really are. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=2998.88s)]
*  Nicole Sade [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3001.44s)]
*  You mentioned Bill Clinton. And that's like the Democratic Party I grew up understanding. It's [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3002.52s)]
*  the party of technocratic competence and, you know, looking out for the working class, keeping [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3008.0s)]
*  the main thing the main thing, the main thing being what James Carville famously said, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3014.08s)]
*  it's the economy is stupid. But over the past, I don't know what the timestamp should be. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3018.48s)]
*  Certainly over the past decade, they've let these fringe issues capture them like [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3023.52s)]
*  DEI, trans women in sports, and obsession with racial identity politics. And as a result, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3027.92s)]
*  you have Trump walking away with this multiracial working class coalition. And it seems to me the [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  only demographic for the current democratic messaging are wealthy white people in the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3040.72s)]
*  suburbs for whom these ideas are luxury beliefs, as I mentioned before, like, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3047.92s)]
*  put the Democrats on the couch. Why are they doing this to themselves? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3052.96s)]
*  Bill Clinton [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a big, I think they're trying to figure out what the hell happened. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3057.6s)]
*  They, they need to have a really heavy dose of self reflection and going back to priorities. And [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3062.64s)]
*  I really, really believe this very with my heart. Elected officials start becoming dangerous. And I [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3073.92s)]
*  that's a very intentional word, dangerous, when it's more important to get reelected than to do [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3082.64s)]
*  the right thing. And you see that with a lot of these career politicians. And so what happens is, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3089.12s)]
*  they take a poll, they're checking the direction of the wind every five minutes before they say [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3096.3199999999997s)]
*  anything, versus actually using common sense and experience to make good decisions that might be [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3100.8799999999997s)]
*  politically tough to do, that might actually risk their job. But they feel they're never in the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3108.4s)]
*  business of risking their job, because they always want to be reelected, because usually, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3114.88s)]
*  most of them are so damn scared to get a real job. Most of them have never signed the front of a [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3120.2400000000002s)]
*  check to know what it is to create a job, keep a job, build a business, balance a budget, do all [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3125.44s)]
*  the things that you and I and most everybody that's listening to this have to do. And that's what [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3132.48s)]
*  really got me during COVID. When a lot of these elected officials would say, we feel your pain. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3138.88s)]
*  No, you don't. You still have your paycheck. And you're at the French Laundry, Gavin Newsom. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3144.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that was a bad move. But you still have your paycheck, you still have your government [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3149.2s)]
*  card, you still have your staff, you still have everything. That's not the way the world is living [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3154.0s)]
*  right now. So we need a reality check in who we're electing. And that's what the Democrats [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3158.56s)]
*  have to really think about is people that resonate, that understand the people they're serving [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3164.48s)]
*  and aren't worried about getting reelected, just making the right decision. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3170.32s)]
*  One of the things that's always sort of confused me is why Republicanism is such a bad brand in [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3175.84s)]
*  California. This is the state that produced Richard Nixon, okay, less popular, but it produced [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. Like, what happened? And could California go red again? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3187.36s)]
*  Oh, listen, I don't know if it can go red again or not. I mean, it could go whatever [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3194.32s)]
*  direction it can go. I don't know what happened. But I think that the Republican Party probably [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3198.48s)]
*  got disconnected like the Democrats are now in many areas, and weren't listening to the people [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3207.6s)]
*  and got really stuck in their ways. And one of the reasons I left at the time is they were getting [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3213.68s)]
*  so into people's bedrooms. That's not where I was, right? And I think they turned off a lot of people. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3220.3999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, you've got to respect people's rights of how they're living their lives or, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3227.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, what they choose to do or, or how they're born and, and how they want to live their lives [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3234.8799999999997s)]
*  based on that. And the Republican Party wasn't doing that. And I think he kept digging a hole. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3240.48s)]
*  And they were tone deaf. And they paid the price for it. It seems to be going around now on the [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3245.12s)]
*  Democratic side. Is there anything that would cause you to flip yet again and become a Republican? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3252.16s)]
*  I don't know. I don't really care about the designation, to be real honest about it. If I [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3258.0s)]
*  ever got back into politics, I just want to be given an opportunity to go do a really good job [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3265.84s)]
*  and then hold me accountable. And don't give me a pass because I'm a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3271.44s)]
*  Just hold me accountable. And if you don't like what I'm doing, throw me out of office. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3276.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, Rick, that is a perfect transition for two minutes of a lightning round. Starting here, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3280.96s)]
*  Rick Caruso, will you run for governor of California? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3286.88s)]
*  I really don't know yet. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3289.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay, but likely yes or likely no? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3291.84s)]
*  No, there's no likely in it. I'm not even thinking about it given what's going on in Los Angeles [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3294.88s)]
*  right now. I have time. I have time. Down the road, I am going to give it some thought, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3300.56s)]
*  but I'm not giving it thought now. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3305.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I want to name some political figures. And I want you to give these people a letter [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3306.96s)]
*  grade for their performances like A, B, C, D or F. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3311.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3314.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's start with Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3314.7200000000003s)]
*  What's the scale again? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3318.48s)]
*  A to F. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3320.4s)]
*  A to F. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3321.92s)]
*  You know, I'm going to give her a little bit of love. I'll give her a D. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3323.2s)]
*  Okay, Governor Newsom. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3326.16s)]
*  I'll give him a B. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3328.4s)]
*  Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3330.08s)]
*  I'll give him a B. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3332.16s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3333.44s)]
*  Yet to be said. Two really out. We're only a month into it. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3335.44s)]
*  Elon Musk. He counts as a political figure to me. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3339.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I think Elon Musk is one of the all-time most brilliant [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3343.6s)]
*  entrepreneurs and innovators we've had in our country, in our world. I admire him greatly. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3348.96s)]
*  And quite frankly, I like the fact that he's donating his time to help our country. So [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3356.64s)]
*  I'd give him probably somewhere between an A and a B. I like Elon. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3363.36s)]
*  Okay, you're a Dodgers fan. You even tried to buy the Dodgers. If you had to choose [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3367.52s)]
*  one Dodgers player to marry into your family, which one would you pick? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3371.68s)]
*  Oh my gosh. I don't know the players that well to be able to do that. I'm not going down that [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3375.76s)]
*  road. I got to get in trouble. There's too many great Dodger players. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3383.28s)]
*  Which is the better city? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3387.44s)]
*  I only have one daughter, by the way. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. Well, I'm just saying who's your favorite. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3390.32s)]
*  And she's got a great boyfriend who we love. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3392.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay, Rick. Which is the best city of the following three? San Diego, San Francisco, or Fresno? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3398.88s)]
*  San Diego, San Francisco, or Fresno? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3405.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3408.6400000000003s)]
*  San Francisco. I love San Francisco. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3409.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you love about San Francisco? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3412.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, the history, the bay, the architecture, everything about it. San Francisco is going [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3414.0s)]
*  to come back. I got a lot of confidence in the new mayor, Lurie, and I think it's going to come [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3419.6000000000004s)]
*  back and technology is going to fuel that city and its comeback. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3425.6800000000003s)]
*  Who was the last great mayor of Los Angeles? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3432.0800000000004s)]
*  I really loved all three that I worked for. Tom Bradley was a remarkable guy who I learned a [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3436.4s)]
*  lot from, but I'd have to say something that most people would never expect. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3444.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3451.0400000000004s)]
*  Jim Hahn. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3452.2400000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3453.6000000000004s)]
*  Because Jim Hahn, when I was the police commissioner, gave me the freedom to make a choice that was [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3455.0400000000004s)]
*  politically unpopular, to fire a very popular black chief of police, Bernie Parks, and he paid [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3460.08s)]
*  the ultimate consequence for it. Then I hired Bill Bratton. When I called him the night before the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3469.12s)]
*  announcement and I said, Mr. Mayor, this is going to be my recommendation, and I know it has large [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3475.04s)]
*  political consequences, he said, Rick, you go do the right thing. He lost his second term because [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3480.7999999999997s)]
*  of that. The black community abandoned him. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3487.6s)]
*  Rick, you are an incredible developer. For people who are not familiar with your work, I highly [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3490.56s)]
*  recommend when they next go to Los Angeles to visit The Grove. What is your favorite store in [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3496.72s)]
*  The Grove? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3501.36s)]
*  My daughter's, GGC. She started her own brand as a young entrepreneur with my wife or mom, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3502.7999999999997s)]
*  and I am so damn proud of her as a woman-owned business who started with literally nothing on [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3510.4s)]
*  her own and is a great designer and a great CEO. That's my favorite store. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3517.28s)]
*  Did any Hollywood celebrities tell you privately that they would vote for you for Mayor in 2022, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3522.5600000000004s)]
*  but felt like they couldn't make a public endorsement? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3528.96s)]
*  Yeah, I won't name names, but yeah, no. Many people did at the time. It was sort of politically [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3532.5600000000004s)]
*  incorrect if you were for me in some circles, for sure. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3539.52s)]
*  Do you think that that would be different if you ran today, if it was the same race today? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3545.04s)]
*  I think it would be different. I may be kidding myself. I don't know. I think it would be [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3551.36s)]
*  different. I think if I could call somebody out, you take a guy like Katzenberg who led the charge [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3554.8s)]
*  against me in supporting Karen, raised a lot of money and cast me as a really terrible human being. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3563.68s)]
*  And covered up Joe Biden's mental state. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3573.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, he just, you know, like the other day, I was at an event and he came up to me [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3576.7200000000003s)]
*  and tried to shake my hand and I said, there's no way I'll ever shake your hand. I think those kind [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3583.36s)]
*  of people are dangerous in politics and they should be held accountable for the things that they did. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3589.36s)]
*  Did you actually say that to him? I won't shake your hand? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3594.1600000000003s)]
*  I would not shake his hand. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3597.04s)]
*  And how did he reply? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3598.48s)]
*  And how did he reply? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3600.0s)]
*  He just had this sort of stunned look on his face. But I think this is where core values and [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3602.16s)]
*  character matter. And if you want to oppose me, at least do it in a way that has a sense of honesty [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3608.72s)]
*  to it. But if you're not going to be honest, I don't want you in my world. And I'm certainly [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3616.24s)]
*  not going to give you the benefit of a handshake, which is a gesture of friendship. There is no [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3621.92s)]
*  friendship there because he disrespected my family. And so unless he says he's sorry publicly [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3626.24s)]
*  and that what he said was wrong publicly, at that point, I'll forgive him because [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3634.0s)]
*  forgiveness is important. But until then, I won't. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3638.9599999999996s)]
*  Rick Caruso, tell people as a last question, what you are currently working on, what you, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  how you are spending your days because we know you're so involved in the rebuilding of LA. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3648.16s)]
*  What are you working on? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3653.68s)]
*  You know, every minute of the day, it's around this nonprofit that we created called Steadfast LA, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3655.28s)]
*  which is dedicated to representing the victims, both in Altadena and Palisades, Malibu, everywhere. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3660.64s)]
*  And it's issues driven. It's providing answers to the city, the state, and the federal government [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3667.2s)]
*  to get the rebuilding done quicker, to get people in their homes, to get their churches, synagogues [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3674.0s)]
*  rebuilt, to not allow any excuses by elected or appointed officials. It's really to bend the curve [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3679.52s)]
*  and to do it quickly. We've got a lot of people that are just heartbroken and a lot of kids that [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3687.2s)]
*  are displaced from their schools and their community. And I don't accept that it's going [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3694.0s)]
*  to take years to get back. And so this organization, we've had some of the best [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3699.28s)]
*  companies donate their time surrounding us. You know, we've got Parsons, we've got Esri, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3703.76s)]
*  we've got Amazon, we've got law firms. Some of the smartest, most talented people are donating [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3709.44s)]
*  their time and talent. And we're going to go out at Every Day Berry and help the city [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3715.92s)]
*  and help the county make some really good decisions. And we're here to serve them. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3722.4s)]
*  And quite frankly, if it makes Karen Bass a hero, great. If it makes anybody a hero, great. I just [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3727.36s)]
*  want people, including my daughter and their son, and everybody like them to be able to get back [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3732.4s)]
*  into the communities they love. And Rick, last question. If Donald Trump tapped you to help [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3738.56s)]
*  rebuild Gaza, Mara Gaza, let's call it, would you say yes? I think anytime the President of the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3744.32s)]
*  United States asks you to serve their country, if you're capable of doing it and qualify the [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  answers, yes. Rick Caruso, I know you're running, so I'll say maybe future governor Rick Caruso. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3758.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining. Berry, I loved every minute. Thank you for having me. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfGuqqqZcE&t=3764.64s)]
