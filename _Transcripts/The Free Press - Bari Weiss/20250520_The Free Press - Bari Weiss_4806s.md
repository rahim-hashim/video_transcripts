When you think about great political comebacks, maybe you think of Donald Trump, or Richard Nixon, or “comeback kid” Bill Clinton.

You might soon add Andrew Cuomo to that list. In 2020, Cuomo was at the top of the world. He had been governor of New York for a decade. He had an illustrious career in New York politics—which is sort of the Cuomo family business. He learned how the state worked from his father, three-term Democratic governor Mario Cuomo.

When Covid hit, Cuomo’s star just kept rising. Millions of Americans—even outside of New York—tuned into his Covid briefings and his CNN segments with his brother, Chris Cuomo, then of CNN.

He was “America’s governor.” On the cover of Rolling Stone. Women and men were even self-identifying as “Cuomosexual.”

Then it all came crashing down. With two scandals—one personal and one political.

As Covid was peaking in New York City, Andrew Cuomo was hit with a wave of allegations. In the end, state Attorney General Letitia James brought forward a report that alleged Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women. (Cuomo denies wrongdoing.)

The other scandal, as many will recall, had to do with Covid. Specifically, Cuomo’s administration was accused of mishandling the readmission of elders who’d had Covid into nursing homes—and many alleged that he misrepresented the nursing home death count. (The governor also disputes that, as you’ll hear today.)

On August 10, 2021, Cuomo announced his resignation. His political career appeared to be over.

For a time he totally disappeared from public life. He went from having a huge audience—59 million viewers in total—tuning into his Covid briefings… to zero.

Today, in May 2025, the picture is dramatically different.

Andrew Cuomo is now the front-runner to be the next mayor of New York City. Among Democrats—the party that tore him down—he has a commanding lead, polling at around 37 percent ahead of next month’s primary. His closest competitor, 33-year-old socialist state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, is hovering around 18 percent, according to a Marist poll from just last week.

So: What is it about Andrew Cuomo? Will New York choose him again? And if so: Why?

What does that say about the state of the city and our political choices? And why does he want the job of mayor at all?

*  Cuomo about all of it. About COVID, the nursing homes, and the harassment allegations, yes, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=162.72s)]
*  but also, and perhaps more importantly in this moment, his vision for how to fix New York City. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=168.64s)]
*  What his thoughts are on crime, public safety, and housing affordability. His thoughts on school [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=174.16s)]
*  choice, Eric Adams' tenure, the state of the Democratic Party, Donald Trump, illegal immigration [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=179.44s)]
*  in New York City, his leading opponent, socialism, and his plan for getting New York City back on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=185.92s)]
*  track. Stay with us. Governor Andrew Cuomo, welcome to Honestly. Oh, thank you for having me. It's my [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=192.32s)]
*  pleasure. Very excited to have you here in the Free Press Newsroom. Okay, so we are talking, it is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  May 19th. On June 24th, registered Democrats in New York are going to head to the polls and they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=208.48s)]
*  are going to have the choice to vote for you or one of, I think it's a dozen, 11 other people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  running for the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York City. Why should they choose you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=219.76s)]
*  Well, I think, Barry, and again, thank you very much for having me. And you're right, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  the election is coming up and it's a very important election. Not just for New York City, I think, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=228.24s)]
*  but actually for the Democratic Party. One of the themes here is what did we learn from the Trump [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=233.36s)]
*  election? We lost that election. Why and what are we doing in response? But on a more local level, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=243.12s)]
*  New York City is in real trouble. And in many ways, it's emblematic of what's happening in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=253.28s)]
*  urban areas all across the country. You look at Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, etc. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=259.44s)]
*  We're losing people. We lost about 500,000 people from New York City post-COVID. You have that new [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=265.36s)]
*  reality. You can zoom. You can be anywhere. You're more mobile. Why do I need to be in New York City [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=272.4s)]
*  and pay those high taxes, especially when the quality of life drops and now it's not even as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=278.4s)]
*  enjoyable? So the city is in trouble. And public safety, quality of life, which sort of blend [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=285.12s)]
*  together. There was a movement a few years ago to reduce the number of police officers, defund the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=293.2s)]
*  police. So you have a public safety issue. Subways are frightening again in a way people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=298.96s)]
*  haven't seen. If you're like me, lifelong New Yorker, I remember this from the bad old days, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=309.28s)]
*  but it's shocking to people who haven't seen that. Dangerous mentally ill people on the street. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  City is just not affordable. You can't find an affordable place to live. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=323.44s)]
*  And there's a sense that the city is just out of control. There's just a chaos factor, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=328.8s)]
*  You can't even cross the street. E-bikes are coming from every direction. And that culminates [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=335.68s)]
*  in the sense of anxiety and fear that is really driving people from New York. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=343.68s)]
*  So people should vote for you because you're going to fix that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=350.48s)]
*  Because I know what the problems are. I know what the answers are and I can get it done. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=353.28s)]
*  I've worked in government and I have shown that I can make government work, which I think is central [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=362.08s)]
*  to all of this, right? The Democratic Party is the party that believes in government. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=368.56s)]
*  We're not Ronald Reagan. Government is the problem, not the solution. So the burden is on [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=374.32s)]
*  us to make the government work. And when I was governor, I made the government work. It produced [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=379.44s)]
*  for people efficiently and effectively. Okay. I want to talk about some of the issues you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=386.56s)]
*  raised. Homelessness, the subway, crime, certainly education in a minute. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=391.76s)]
*  Let's stay on the big picture for another second. You're polling at 37%. Your closest competitor, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=396.24s)]
*  and we'll talk about him in a little bit as well, I think is polling at 18%. Looks like you're going [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=401.2s)]
*  to walk away with this thing. Part of the criticism of the campaign you're running is that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=406.0s)]
*  you've basically been running a Rose Garden, what people are calling a Rose Garden strategy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=410.08s)]
*  You're not doing a lot on the campaign trail and critics say that you're basically coasting on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=414.88s)]
*  incredible name recognition. What do you say to that? Yeah. First of all, it's not name recognition. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=420.08s)]
*  We certainly have that. Yes, but it's name recognition suggests they know your name and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=427.28s)]
*  that's all. That's not my relationship with the people of New York. I was governor for 11 years. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=432.88s)]
*  I was attorney general for four years. I was HUD secretary before that. I worked with my father [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  for 12 years before that. So yes, New Yorkers know me intimately well. We went through COVID [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=447.2s)]
*  together. They watched me every day. They know the good, the bad. They know every side of me. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=456.4s)]
*  They know me. So that's, I have a long-term relationship with the people of New York [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  and I'm running a campaign that I believe connects with them. I would much rather spend my time [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=470.88s)]
*  talking to New Yorkers, being in a public housing project, walking the streets with New Yorkers, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=478.56s)]
*  than playing a political game with the inside political machinations. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=487.12s)]
*  I don't want to spend a lot of time with the inside media and the inside political groups [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=495.52s)]
*  playing political factions. I like to talk to New Yorkers. That's what I've always done. I've [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=502.72s)]
*  run before. I've run a number of times and that's what I've done and that is what works for me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let's talk a little bit about your politics writ large. You become governor for the first time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=515.44s)]
*  in 2010 and you were elected as a moderate who courted Republican voters. Back then, of course, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=521.28s)]
*  the key issue had been the 2008 financial crisis and the economic recovery and you ran on issues [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=527.52s)]
*  like fiscal discipline, ethics reform, and restoring trust. Fast forward and New York [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  Democrats and I think maybe Democrats across the country started moving leftward and so did you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=538.96s)]
*  You banned fracking in 2014. You hiked minimum wage beyond the national average in 2016. You [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=543.68s)]
*  passed well before Dobs, one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country. People in New York [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=550.56s)]
*  City can get an abortion up to 24 weeks. You raise taxes. You legalize recreational marijuana in 2021 [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=555.12s)]
*  and then you're cast out of your party or let's just say you resign the governorship in 2021, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=562.24s)]
*  which we'll talk about in a bit. Now you're sort of back to running again in the OG Cuomo mode [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=567.92s)]
*  as a moderate message of public safety, of affordability, of standing up against extremist [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=574.16s)]
*  politics and you definitely have some extremist contenders in this race. I guess I wanted to ask [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=579.04s)]
*  you, you know, who changed? You or the party? Are you going back to your original roots? Do you feel [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  like in that intermediate period with those policies that I named that you changed? How do [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=589.44s)]
*  you make sense of the arc of the Andrew Cuomo political career? Yeah, Barry, I see it the exact [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=595.2s)]
*  opposite way. I did not change. I think what you're seeing is a Democratic party in search of an [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  identity. That's what's happening. I was always a progressive Democrat. Now back in the day, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=610.24s)]
*  Mario Cuomo, ultra liberal, Andrew Cuomo, ultra liberal, but that's who I was and right out of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=619.28s)]
*  the box, the things I started to do were ultra liberal and I would say ultra progressive. See, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=629.04s)]
*  first of all, I don't see the word progressive to this new far left. Oh, they're progressives. No. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=635.68s)]
*  FDR ran as the progressive candidate, right? He actually stole the term from Teddy Roosevelt, but [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=642.16s)]
*  he was progressive, right? So what do you mean when you say that word? Progressive means making [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=650.4799999999999s)]
*  progress, first of all, for the working women and men who are working their way up the American [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=659.04s)]
*  ladder, right? The reason I say making progress is part of it is there's a functionality to that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=668.48s)]
*  There's a practical dynamic in that you actually do something. You don't just pontificate and it's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  not all conceptual and abstract. Government does something for people. There's a product that makes [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=683.2s)]
*  a difference in your life. So I was always progressive liberal right out of the box when [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  I became governor. I passed marriage equality, which was 2011, which was way ahead of its time. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  This is when it wasn't accepted politically. It wasn't accepted from a popularity point of view. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=704.48s)]
*  But that to me was the next step. That was the creation of a civil right, literally, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=713.84s)]
*  recognizing same-sex marriage. So that was my first year as governor. And then you're right, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  minimum wage and then Roe v. Wade, which I was heavily criticized for at the time, by the way, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=728.6400000000001s)]
*  because the editorial boards all said, oh, this is unnecessary. There is no way the Supreme Court [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  would ever reverse Roe v. Wade. So you don't need a state law because the Supreme Court will never [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=742.56s)]
*  reverse it. Wrong. Right now, there are many, many people in the Democratic Party call themselves [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=748.64s)]
*  progressives, including people that are running against you, that have a very different idea of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=757.1199999999999s)]
*  what that word means. So when you see someone like AOC, some people are talking about her as a possible [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=761.3599999999999s)]
*  candidate in 2028, she's maybe one of the most prominent progressives in the progressive liberal [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=766.64s)]
*  Democrats in the country right now, Bernie Sanders. Do you identify with them? Do you see [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=772.16s)]
*  yourself in the same lane as someone like AOC or Bernie? First, I told you my position on the word [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=775.6s)]
*  progressive. Yes. Mario Cuomo was a progressive. Ted Kennedy was a progressive. So that is, and the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=781.04s)]
*  Democratic, the best of the Democratic Party is the progressive tradition, right? I think the new, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=787.76s)]
*  the far left are socialists, right? Democratic socialists, they call themselves, except there's [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  no such thing as a Democratic socialist, right? You can't be a Yankees fan and a Red Sox fan. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=800.32s)]
*  You can't be a Democrat and a socialist. So sort of pick it. They don't want to say socialists [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=805.2800000000001s)]
*  because it's too jarring. So they want to modify it with the word democratic. No, you're socialists. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's fine. Be a socialist. But then let's talk about socialism. And let's talk about your [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=820.6400000000001s)]
*  running for mayor of the city of New York and you are a socialist. And how is it even possible [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=826.56s)]
*  to have a socialist city in a Democratic capitalist state, in a Democratic capitalist nation, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=834.2399999999999s)]
*  right? You can't. It doesn't work. Nobody's going to live in a socialist city when you have the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=843.68s)]
*  option of just moving 10 miles away, right? So let's have a real conversation about the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=851.44s)]
*  feasibility of this because that's why, you know, I don't believe Trump won the election. I believe [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=860.72s)]
*  Democrats lost the election. And one of the reasons is just this. They are totally disconnected [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=869.44s)]
*  from the people who we traditionally represent, the working women and men of this country [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=878.24s)]
*  who needed someone on their side, needed a champion and needed a government that actually [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=885.2s)]
*  did something for them because it's not a theoretical exercise. Just to push a little [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=890.64s)]
*  on the idea that the Democrats, that Trump didn't win, the Democrats lost. As you well know, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=896.08s)]
*  New York City has swung to the right. I think you could argue, maybe you disagree with me, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=902.16s)]
*  in the past few years. I think between 2020 and 2024, Trump gained something like 100,000 votes [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  in New York City. What do you make of that? Did that surprise you? Yes, it surprised me, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=914.4s)]
*  but I don't credit Trump. I blame the Democrats. Okay. I call it the three D's. The Democratic [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=922.4s)]
*  Party became disconnected from the core Democratic constituency, right? From the labor movement, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=932.08s)]
*  from the working women and men, from the middle class. And I believe the Democrats have an open [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=940.96s)]
*  heart. You know, they're willing to talk to you about marriage equality, clean energy, whatever [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  you want, but you have to talk to them also about their needs. And we just totally disregarded [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=955.44s)]
*  their situation, their economics, and they felt alienated. That was the disconnection. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=963.2s)]
*  And then the second D is dysfunction. The government did not perform, Barry. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=968.24s)]
*  What did the government do for them that changed their lives? Show me something the government [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  produced where they can say, wow, I'm glad I'm a Democrat. Wow. I believe in government because [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=982.08s)]
*  government did this. I don't think there's anything tangible that government has done for them [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=990.48s)]
*  recently. That's why as governor I worked so hard. Minimum wage, money in your pocket, right? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=995.76s)]
*  Free college tuition for the middle class. You don't have to worry about it anymore. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1002.08s)]
*  Marriage equality, civil right. New LaGuardia Airport, JFK Airport, New Second Avenue Subway, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  government made a difference. And the third D is division. When you allow us to divide ourselves, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1012.24s)]
*  you're playing into Trump. When you allow us to become anti-Semitic or alienate the Jewish [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1022.4s)]
*  community, you're playing into Trump because Trump's essential strategy is divide and conquer [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1032.08s)]
*  and divide Jewish people from the rest of the population, divide Asians, et cetera. And once [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1040.72s)]
*  the Democratic Party starts doing that, you license Trump to put a wedge in those divisions [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1050.32s)]
*  and that plays to history. I just want to make sure I'm understanding you. When you're talking [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1058.96s)]
*  about the divisions that the Democratic Party allowed for, are you talking about an identity [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1062.96s)]
*  politics that kind of subsumed the Democratic Party or at least let's say the progressive [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1067.76s)]
*  movement over the past decade or so? I think it started with that identity politics, but [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1073.36s)]
*  let's talk about today like in this mayoral election. You want to be pro-Palestinian, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1078.56s)]
*  God bless you. And I understand that argument. I really do. I am a long-time Israel supporter [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1083.6s)]
*  and I'm proud of it, but I understand the pro-Palestinian argument. I don't understand [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1094.48s)]
*  and I don't accept the hostility to Jewish people. I don't accept the college campus protests where [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1101.44s)]
*  you harass a person because they're wearing a yarmulke. That is hate. That is a hate crime, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1111.92s)]
*  by the way. I passed the strongest hate crimes bill in the United States of America after one of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1119.6s)]
*  terrible anti-Semitic acts. But once you go to that place, you then license Trump to go to that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1124.72s)]
*  place and that's where that is his political playground. That's his sandbox dividing Americans. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1133.04s)]
*  Where do you think that hate is coming from on college campuses and otherwise? Where is [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  it coming from? Well, look, this whole American experiment in democracy, let's be honest, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1145.6s)]
*  E pluribus unum. Here's the concept for America. We take people from all over and then we disregard [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1150.96s)]
*  their differences and we forge one community. E pluribus unum, we make one out of many. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1157.76s)]
*  Yeah, until something happens and we don't disregard the differences and race jumps up to the top [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  or some incident happens and like the Palestinian situation and now anti-Semitism jumps up to the [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1173.28s)]
*  top. So it's always this delicate balance and when you start to divide that place to Trump, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1184.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party is about unity. We have the big tent. We're trying to bring a lot of people [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1192.56s)]
*  together. We're trying to reconcile differences. He's trying to do the opposite. He's trying to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1198.72s)]
*  score points by factionalizing and when we go from making a pro-Palestinian argument to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1203.92s)]
*  hate crimes or hostility against Jewish people, we are then creating a division that gives Trump [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1215.2s)]
*  his political oxygen. I think a lot of people would see it differently. I think the way a lot [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  of people would see it is you're right that the Democratic Party and let's give the best faith [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1230.56s)]
*  argument, the Democratic Party used to be for the working people, used to be more colorblind, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1237.04s)]
*  used to be a party of unity and all of the things that you claim to stand for. But they will say [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1242.8s)]
*  that is not the Democratic Party that my generation has experienced. There's a reason [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1250.96s)]
*  that Donald Trump and the Republicans are walking away with minority communities that they that [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1256.16s)]
*  never in a million years would have considered voting Republican and it's precisely because [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1261.44s)]
*  the Democratic Party has embraced an ideology that explicitly tries to divide people that says [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1266.0s)]
*  certain people are kind of born in this country with a kind of original sin and other people are [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1273.28s)]
*  virtuous simply because of whatever immutable characteristics they have. And it's in a kind of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1278.48s)]
*  way a sort of reversal of whatever caste system or implicit caste system we've lived with forever [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1285.52s)]
*  where white straight able-bodied men like you are at the bottom instead of being at the top. But the [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1293.52s)]
*  point is that they've kept the system in place. They're just sort of reversing who's at the top [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1299.92s)]
*  and who's at the bottom. That's what I mean when I talk about identity politics. It's not pride in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1304.16s)]
*  your identity. It's a view that we're all in a kind of zero-sum game pitted against each other. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1309.76s)]
*  What do you say to people who feel that way about the Democratic Party? There's a lot of people that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1315.28s)]
*  listen to the show and read the free press that are essentially disaffected Democrats, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1320.0s)]
*  liberals who would want to be liberal but for the fact that their party embraced that kind of ideology [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1324.24s)]
*  that it became, you know, that it embraced other things like abolishing the police or defunding the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1330.24s)]
*  police that just seemed to people like jumping the shark. What do you say directly to those people? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1335.84s)]
*  I say you have a choice. You can give up or you can fight back. And I am fighting back. I don't [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1341.36s)]
*  disagree. I do think the Democratic Party jumped the shark. I do think we got overly involved in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1350.16s)]
*  niche issues and lost the forest for the trees in many cases. I wholly agree with that. But I'm not [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1357.2s)]
*  going to give up because give up to what? Give up to Trump and give up to the Republican Party? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1367.92s)]
*  No. We have to take a look in the mirror. Where did we get off the path and correct it? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. In your video announcing your candidacy, you talked about something you've already said [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1384.16s)]
*  in this conversation, which is that the city feels like it's sort of unraveling, threatening, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1390.48s)]
*  it's out of control, it's in crisis. You said this. These conditions do not exist as an act of God, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1394.56s)]
*  but rather as an act of our political leaders or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1400.16s)]
*  many of our political leaders. Name names. Who's to blame for the disorder in the city right now? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1405.52s)]
*  Well- Which people and which actions? Name names. You do ask difficult questions. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1412.24s)]
*  Not really. Yeah, that's kind of difficult. Well, look, obviously Mayor Adams is the current mayor, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1419.12s)]
*  right? You have a city council that has taken, I think, many counterproductive efforts. You have [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1425.28s)]
*  people in the state legislature who have been counterproductive. So I don't think it's any one [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1434.48s)]
*  person. I think it is a government paralysis that has set in because the government is almost [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1443.28s)]
*  afraid to do anything lest it offend some niche constituency. So defund the police. Oh, we all have [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1453.84s)]
*  to be defund the police. And everyone had to jump on board. And all my opponents did, and the city [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1464.8s)]
*  council did. The mayor actually didn't. And we reduced the police force by 3000 because that was [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1473.28s)]
*  the flavor of the month. Now, by the way, they're all in favor of adding police. Why? Because the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1481.04s)]
*  defunding was a mistake. But that was the flavor of the month. And that far left is so intense and so [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1488.8799999999999s)]
*  active and so strong, you better not get on the wrong side of them because they will threaten you [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1497.04s)]
*  and they will threaten you in a primary. And they're very strong in a primary because you have that [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1503.2s)]
*  low turnout and they are the activists. So it's a paralysis. Unless it's perfect, the perfect is the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1507.28s)]
*  enemy is good. Unless it's perfect, we're not going to do it. And we're going to side with the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  advocacy community opposition whenever we can. And we get absolutely nothing done. And you see a [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1526.48s)]
*  deterioration of conditions. And people say, why? And you're all Democrats and I went to Los Angeles [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1534.56s)]
*  and all I saw were blue tarps everywhere and homeless living under bridges, et cetera. And I'm [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1544.56s)]
*  afraid to walk down the street. And it's all Democrats who are in charge. And there's no one [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1552.0s)]
*  else to blame. It's you. And you want to point fingers internally, that does nothing for me. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1559.84s)]
*  It's still you. And that's what you have to fix. We're going to get the dangerous mentally ill off [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1566.48s)]
*  the streets. Why are they there in the first place? Well, they have a civil right, civil liberty [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1573.76s)]
*  to be on the street and live in the subways. No, they don't, first of all. Not that law has anything [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1580.32s)]
*  to do with anything with a lot of these advocates. No, they don't. But second, that's not the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1587.84s)]
*  compassionate, humane response. God forbid a sibling of mine is mentally ill, they're sleeping [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1594.32s)]
*  on the subway. My answer isn't going to be, well, you have a civil right to do this. So I'm going [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1602.8s)]
*  to leave you there. No, get them the mental health care they need. But there's been this over emphasis [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1607.52s)]
*  on civil liberty, civil rights, etc. And you can go down these issues and find some niche, boutique, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1613.6s)]
*  advocacy interests that stopped progress in almost all of them. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1623.6799999999998s)]
*  One of the things that your critics say is they look at the disorder in the city and they say, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1629.1999999999998s)]
*  well, if you look back to the kinds of legislation that you passed as governor, that the roots are in [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1635.04s)]
*  some of those things. So they'll say bail reform, they'll say discovery reform, they'll say raise [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1641.44s)]
*  the age, which changed the age that a child can be prosecuted as an adult to 18 from 16 to 17. Or [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1647.8400000000001s)]
*  they'll say you closed 24 state prisons or something like that when you were governor of New York. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1654.4s)]
*  What do you say to those people who claim, yeah, it's easy to point a finger at Eric Adams or they [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1659.6000000000001s)]
*  defund the police movement, but actually, like the flavor of the month back then was broadly under [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1664.8s)]
*  the umbrella of criminal justice reform. All of these things happened and we're now suffering [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1670.56s)]
*  the consequences of those things. Yeah. First of all, Barry, I haven't been governor for four years. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1674.72s)]
*  What government does is a situation rises to the surface. Resolve it. That's why you're there. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1682.24s)]
*  So what are you saying? For four years, you did nothing and you want to point back to things I [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1689.36s)]
*  did 10 years ago and they happen to be wrong. And they happen to vote for all those things. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1697.04s)]
*  And those are good things. Raise the age was a good thing. You don't put a 16 year old in a state [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1703.52s)]
*  prison. You don't do that. It's inhumane. We were only one of two states in the United States that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  did that. Put them in a juvenile facility because otherwise they'll just be preyed upon in a state [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1719.6s)]
*  prison. Bail reform was a good thing and they all voted for it. And by the way, they've changed the [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1725.92s)]
*  law four times since I passed the law. So they had four opportunities to fix it if they thought there [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1733.68s)]
*  was a problem. But bail reform is basically a good thing. What it says is you go before a judge, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1741.52s)]
*  you haven't been found guilty of anything. And he sets bail, money bail. And if you're poor, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1747.68s)]
*  you go to Rikers Island and you could be there for a year, two years before you're ever tried. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1755.04s)]
*  Bail was supposed to be to make sure you came back to trial. I had wanted the judge to have [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1763.28s)]
*  discretion to see if the what they call the dangerous standard had been met. The legislature [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1769.12s)]
*  wouldn't do that at the time. I think that should have been added. In other words, bail reform is, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1775.28s)]
*  yeah, you can get out on bail. Unless the judge thinks you're dangerous, then he says, no, I'm [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1780.16s)]
*  going to remand you and hold you because I think you're dangerous. They eliminated that standard. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1786.48s)]
*  And again, they changed it four times since. So it's not even the law I passed. Discovery [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1794.48s)]
*  reform, Discovery said you should know what you're charged with before you go to trial. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1800.24s)]
*  You have a right to discover the evidence against you. That was a good thing. And all the Democrats [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1807.68s)]
*  supported that. Did it need to be tweaked? Of course it did. And if I were governor, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1814.48s)]
*  I would have done that. Every law is an iterative process, right? You pass it this year and you [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1821.04s)]
*  tweak it next year and thereafter. But again, it's now five, six years. And they have been [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1827.52s)]
*  changing the laws, but they're responsible for the laws that are on the books. Closing the prisons, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1835.68s)]
*  it's not that we closed the prisons and released anyone. The population dropped. So there was no [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1841.76s)]
*  need for the prisons. That's why we closed the prisons. So none of it, none of it is true. They're [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1848.96s)]
*  just excuses. You had four years. I would not have tolerated these conditions. I'm with New Yorkers. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1856.4s)]
*  This is intolerable. Housing is another core issue for people living in New York City. The price of it [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1869.2800000000002s)]
*  is unbelievable. You and everyone else running in the Democratic primary has a different proposal [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1877.44s)]
*  for how they're going to bring back affordable housing, how they're going to build new housing. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1883.84s)]
*  How do you do that? There's not a lot of incentive for developers to build affordable housing. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1888.56s)]
*  You have said that you want to build or preserve half a million, I think, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1892.8s)]
*  affordable apartments over the next 10 years. How are you going to do it? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1897.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Affordable housing is one of the core topics. And it also gets the sort of the essence of what [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1900.8s)]
*  this race is all about. And again, what the Democratic party is all about. Affordable housing, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  first you need a government subsidy to make it work. I was HUD secretary under Bill Clinton, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1913.2s)]
*  as you know, Housing and Urban Development. So there's a number of ways government can subsidize. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1919.04s)]
*  You can give free land. You can make zoning changes. You can provide a cash subsidy, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1924.32s)]
*  a Section 8 voucher, tax credits, et cetera. But you need a government subsidy. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1929.2s)]
*  That's not really the sticking point. You need government to work to get it done. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1935.0400000000002s)]
*  That's the sticking point. That's the dysfunction of government, right? Because it's hard to build [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  in New York. You know, New Yorkers, whatever you propose, there's going to be opposition, right? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1952.48s)]
*  You propose a site, there's going to be opposition. And the government is paralyzed. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1959.12s)]
*  And if there's any community opposition, the city council has delegated to every city council member [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1965.36s)]
*  the right to veto any project in their district. So if that council member [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1972.72s)]
*  caters to NIMBY, they can stop a project, right? The state program is very hard to use. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1979.76s)]
*  The city administration, HPD, which is the Housing Department, is very hard to navigate. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  So government is just not working, right? And when you say why are people frustrated with the- [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=1996.8s)]
*  Do we need a doge for New York City? No, we don't need a doge. We need competition. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2003.4399999999998s)]
*  We need competence. You know, affordable housing. We built public housing in the 40s and the 50s, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2010.24s)]
*  thousands and thousands of units. When I was in my 20s, I built hundreds of units [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  of housing in New York City. This is a relatively recent phenomenon where we have become [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2024.24s)]
*  incompetent and paralyzed. And well, how do I know I can do it? Because I have done it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2031.28s)]
*  You think it's hard to build 100 units of housing. Try to build an airport. You know, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2041.8400000000001s)]
*  try to build a bridge and deal with all those environmental issues, right? Try to build a new [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2047.92s)]
*  subway line and deal with all those issues. And government has to be able to defeat its own [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2054.4s)]
*  bureaucracy, handle the opposition politically, which is going to come. And I know politicians [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2064.8s)]
*  don't like to have any opposition, but if you want to be an executive and you want to be an [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2073.04s)]
*  effective politician, you have to stand up to the opposition. You have to have the competence to [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2077.92s)]
*  actually get it done. You have to move the bureaucracy. And we don't have enough government [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2083.2s)]
*  functionality. We didn't have it on the federal level. And we don't have it today. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2091.9199999999996s)]
* talks about schools. New York City spends, I think, $30,000 per student. It is the highest [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2097.6s)]
*  of any state in America, but the results are abysmal. Mississippi recently overtook New York [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2103.9199999999996s)]
*  schools in reading outcomes for fourth graders. How is this possible? What are you going to do to [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2110.88s)]
*  change that if you're mayor? Yeah, well, again, it's we politicized education, right? We over [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  emphasized awareness programs, social programs, and we forgot about things like reading and math, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2127.84s)]
*  right? So now, and I think it's the right move, go back to teaching reading, which is actually the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2136.24s)]
*  new innovation barriers. They're now bringing back phonics. I know. What's the answer to education? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2145.3599999999997s)]
*  Phonics. Well, how did we forget about what happened to phonics? You know, whose idea was that? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2152.72s)]
*  Uh, getting back to basic math, right? So that's part of it. But I also think it's an opportunity [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2159.92s)]
*  to revolutionize the education system because, look, we're dealing with a model that was designed [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2168.48s)]
*  generations ago, literally when we were still in agricultural society. K to 12. No, why don't we [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2175.44s)]
*  start with early childhood learning? I started in this state pre K, right? Every study says the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2184.4s)]
*  younger you get the child, the more ability to, uh, uh, advance their education. Child care, start [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2192.08s)]
*  earlier, have after school as part of the educational system and have free college as part of the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2200.8s)]
*  educational system. A high school diploma is not enough, uh, vocational training, tech training, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2210.08s)]
*  or college, but that's what we should be. We should be expanding the public education system, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  which would then touch everyone. And then again, back to the core democratic coalition, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2225.04s)]
*  what did government do for you? Not just public education, quick K to 12, child care, uh, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2231.84s)]
*  K to 12 free college after school, better for the youth, freeze up a workforce. Uh, that's the kind [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2239.2s)]
*  of advancements we have to make. How much of the abysmal outcomes in New York city education are [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  the result of teachers unions? The reason I ask that is, you know, I, I care a lot about school [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2255.7599999999998s)]
*  choice as an issue. I've probably edited thousands of op-eds by people on this issue and then COVID [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2262.24s)]
*  happened. And I feel like in the span of a year or two, COVID did more to make the case for school [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2268.56s)]
*  choice than any think tank, any op-ed, anything. Parents saw what was going on in their classrooms [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2273.52s)]
*  and thought, why, why is this what my tax money is going to? Why don't I have a choice in 2015? I [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2280.0s)]
*  believe it was you put forward, you don't support traditional school vouchers, but you did support [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2286.72s)]
*  a limited tax credit for families looking for kids to send, looking to allow their kids to go [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2292.96s)]
*  to non-public schools. But the effort failed because of oppositions from the opposition from [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2298.64s)]
*  the teachers union. What is your view of teachers unions today? Do you consider yourself a school [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2304.0s)]
*  choice proponent? Do you think that the teachers unions in New York city have too much power? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2309.12s)]
*  Well, first, as you said, I did put forth a tax exemption policy because look, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2314.7200000000003s)]
*  I went to parochial school, right? So my parents are paying taxes to support the public education [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2321.12s)]
*  system and I went to a Catholic school and they paid that tuition and paid that tuition for high [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2327.52s)]
*  school also. Why don't they get a benefit? A lot of religious families do the same thing in their [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2333.44s)]
*  respective religions. Unions, is a teacher union very powerful? No doubt. Is it the most powerful [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2339.36s)]
*  political force in the Democratic Party? In the Democratic Party in this state? Yes. But I also [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2348.8s)]
*  support unions 100% because when you talk about helping the middle class, the union movement made [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2358.4s)]
*  the middle class, right? Collective bargaining made the middle class and the labor movement [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2364.88s)]
*  is the movement that brought the middle class to a place where they have benefits and wages [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2373.28s)]
*  and protections and equalize the playing field vis-a-vis management. Now, can you go overboard? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2379.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, but that's up to the manager, right? That's up to the executive. Just because they're very [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2387.44s)]
*  strong politically doesn't mean you have to succumb, right? Stand up. Stand up for what you [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2394.32s)]
*  believe and fight the fight. Do you believe in school choice? I believe at this point, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2403.28s)]
*  I believe in charter schools, but I believe we have so much work to do in the public school [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2411.28s)]
*  system now, which is educating like 95% of our students. We have to focus on that and we have to [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2418.32s)]
*  fix that, Barry. New York City became a sanctuary city originally in 1989 and then Bill de Blasio [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2425.92s)]
*  further codified the sanctuary policies into law. There are a lot of undocumented immigrants in New [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2432.7200000000003s)]
*  York City. Obviously, this has become a huge fixture of the Trump White House so far and of [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2438.88s)]
*  his campaign. If you're mayor, do you want to keep New York City a sanctuary city and what does [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2444.64s)]
*  that mean for you? The migrant issue is the third D in the demise of the Democratic Party to Trump, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2450.48s)]
*  right? It was disconnection from our base. It was the dysfunction of government and it was division [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2457.92s)]
*  and division, the exclamation point was the migrant debacle and that was a debacle. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2466.0s)]
*  I understand the federal administration took a political position against Trump. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2474.64s)]
*  They were going to open the borders, no more remain in Mexico, but what did you think was [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2482.0s)]
*  going to happen when you brought hundreds of thousands of people into this country? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2486.56s)]
*  Where were they going to go? Who was going to house them, right? Now, I'm a governor so I tend [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2491.52s)]
*  to think practically, but someone had to think about what is going to happen and then, okay, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2497.76s)]
*  Governor Abbott, he's the demon. He put them on buses and sent them to New York and Martha's [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2506.0s)]
*  Vineyard and wherever else. Yes, but his point was my state just got flooded with hundreds of [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2512.0s)]
*  thousands of people and the federal government is nowhere to be found. So if you want them, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  here they are. I think it was inhumane and callous of what he did, possibly illegal, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2523.04s)]
*  but there's no doubt that- But you would agree it was brilliant politically? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2529.84s)]
*  It was brilliant, it was a little strong. I don't want to give him that much credit. It was effective [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2534.32s)]
*  politically. Effective. But the point is it was the Democrats' mistake that Trump seized, right? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2538.08s)]
*  And then they get to New York City and New York City accepts them, has no place to put them, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2545.92s)]
*  puts them in hotels, gives them food vouchers, gives them cash spending money. And a lot of New [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  Yorkers say, what the heck? I had to wait online, I had to do everything right and now they get a [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2562.6400000000003s)]
*  hotel room and they get cash and I'm still killing myself paying a rent that I can't afford. So I [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2570.16s)]
*  think that created a division that split even the Democratic Party. I think it radicalized a lot of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2578.3999999999996s)]
*  people. Yes. Okay, let's talk about specifically one of the people that is running in this race [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2586.3199999999997s)]
*  against you named Zoran Mamdani. Talk about socialists. I would say that he is one, but [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2592.3199999999997s)]
*  he's a self-described socialist. He's a state assemblyman from Queens and he is polling at [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2597.3599999999997s)]
*  18%. You're ahead at 37% as we talked about earlier, but 18% for someone who had zero [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2601.8399999999997s)]
*  name recognition a few months ago is pretty significant. Why do you think people are attracted [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2608.24s)]
*  to him as a candidate? Barry, it's what you mentioned before and it is the danger for this [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2612.72s)]
*  Democratic Party. The far left is not, quote unquote, progressive. They are Democratic socialists [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2622.88s)]
*  and that means they are socialists and they're advancing socialism, which again is impossible [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2632.4s)]
*  to have a socialist city in a capitalist state nation. But put that aside, they're socialists, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2641.28s)]
*  they've seized the pro-Palestinian movement, which has brought them thousands of young people, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  and there's an apparent appeal to the claim, especially if you don't really take a responsible [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2655.8399999999997s)]
*  analysis, free everything, free, freeze rent. Yeah, let's just go through some of them so people [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2667.52s)]
*  know. He is proposing a $30 minimum wage, 200,000 new rent stabilized homes, government [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2676.08s)]
*  controlled grocery stores. There might be other policies, but I mean for most people who are not [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2682.64s)]
*  thinking about the practicality of it, they're hearing, wow, $30 minimum wage, that sounds [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2689.52s)]
*  awesome. Price cap grocery stores, sounds great. How do you compete with a platform like that? How [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2695.04s)]
*  do you educate people that that's not possible? You have to hope that they have a brain in their [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2700.24s)]
*  head, right? Free transportation, government run grocery stores, which I don't even know how that [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2706.0s)]
*  works and what happens to the private run grocery stores, we just get away with, just eliminate them. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2715.52s)]
*  Free childcare, free college, everything free, everything free. Great, you know, I'm for free. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2723.36s)]
*  How do you pay for it? Oh, you tax the rich. Okay, and why would the rich stay here, by the way, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2732.2400000000002s)]
*  in this socialist city of New York? And why wouldn't they move five miles away and save [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2741.92s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars by moving to Nassau, Westchester, or just Florida, so many into [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2749.0400000000004s)]
*  Florida, which is already a major problem we have. So it's not real, but it is appealing. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2755.04s)]
*  Add to it the pro-Palestinian movement, which is galvanizing, you pick it, 30% of the Democrats [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2763.92s)]
*  are pro-Palestinian, 40%. Do you think it's pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel? Because I just [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2776.88s)]
*  want to, Mamdani is, you know, he says that the U.S. is subsidizing a genocide in supporting Israel. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2783.68s)]
*  He supports the BDS movement, the movement to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2791.3599999999997s)]
*  New York is obviously the home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and this is a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2796.8799999999997s)]
*  person who recently declined to sign a resolution condemning the Holocaust. You're calling him [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  pro-Palestinian, but some people think, hear that, and think he's actually something closer to an [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2806.3999999999996s)]
*  anti-Semite. Yeah. What do you think? I'm being kind. You know, anti-Semite, then you have to [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2812.48s)]
*  look into somebody's soul and look at their motivation, but the position he has taken vis-a-vis Israel [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2817.52s)]
*  is radically hostile. But getting back to the Socialist, all of my opponents are basically [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  DSA, pro-BDS. Right? DSA, one of the core planks is you support BDS, Boycott Disinvestment Sanctions. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2835.12s)]
*  You have a controller who disinvested from Israel bonds, right? Had a large portfolio, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2845.04s)]
*  let it mature, didn't buy new Israel bonds, while the state controller did the exact opposite. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2852.64s)]
*  You have a city council speaker who never traveled to Israel in four years, first time ever. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2858.24s)]
*  Governor, I think a lot of people look at that and think, okay, Andrew Cuomo or, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2863.6s)]
*  you know, pick Democrats of your generation. They're a vestige of a Democratic party that is [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2870.32s)]
*  fading away, and people like Zoram Mamdani or Brad Lander or AOC, that's the future of the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2877.68s)]
*  Democratic party. That's becoming the normative position among young Democrats. What do you say [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2884.16s)]
*  to people who feel that way and think, that can't be a party for me if those are the kinds [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2889.76s)]
*  of things they're embracing? Look, if you're going to say, the reason I want to stand pro-Palestinian [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2894.2400000000002s)]
*  is that's a policy position and that's a discussion reasonable people can have. But when you go to [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism and hate, the law I passed in this state was no hate in our state. Once you go there, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2908.5600000000004s)]
*  once you go to college protests with the harassing hate crimes against Jewish people, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2918.16s)]
*  once you say that is okay, it's over this thing we call democracy, right? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2925.68s)]
*  Now you're playing into Trump, you know, the China virus, China virus, China virus, and we had a rash [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2934.16s)]
*  of attacks against Chinese people, right? Now you're putting wedges into American society, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2940.16s)]
*  and that is a very frightening, fractured country. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2948.7999999999997s)]
*  I agree, but what do you say to someone that says, Andrew, look, I really appreciate what [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2953.92s)]
*  you're saying, but look at what's coming up behind you. You know, Zoram Mamdani might not [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2960.4s)]
*  win in this primary, but he is an unbelievably talented politician. He's masterful at social [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2965.2s)]
*  media, regardless of what you think of his policies, he is, and that's the future of your party. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2971.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I say hate loses. Hate loses at the end of the day. And if you're going to allow anti-Semitism [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2977.52s)]
*  and hateful activity to continue, which by the way happens to be illegal, right? Now you can say [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2988.48s)]
*  yes, but the democratic establishment is very tolerant of it, but it happens to be illegal, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=2995.76s)]
*  then there is no answer because today is the Jewish community, tomorrow it will be someone else, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3003.84s)]
*  right? That's what the migrant situation started, right? Latinos, alienating Latinos. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3010.2400000000002s)]
*  But what do you say to young people who say, I don't, when I hear Mamdani or when I hear any [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3017.92s)]
*  of these other people talking about BDS, I don't hear hate, I hear someone that's standing up for [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3022.88s)]
*  the underdog. Yeah, and when you see a Jewish kid getting beaten up because they're wearing [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3027.84s)]
*  a yarmulke, what do you call that, right? When you see swastikas on a synagogue, what do you call [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3032.96s)]
*  that, right? When you see people getting yelled at when they're coming out of a synagogue, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3040.0s)]
*  what do you call that? No, I don't believe hate wins. I don't believe, I believe yes, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3046.08s)]
*  you can have very strong views about pro-Palestinian, but I think, I hope, I pray, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3053.84s)]
*  the only way I could sleep at night is, but they will not go to hate. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3063.04s)]
*  You've raised $1.5 million around there, it might be more. Mamdani, the character we're talking, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3069.2s)]
*  the person we're talking about has raised something similar. You have the most money, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3075.76s)]
*  but you have around 2,000 donors. He has around 15,000, eight times more. Does that concern you? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3080.0s)]
*  He, well, the Democratic Socialists of America, that's a national organization, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3087.76s)]
*  and they're very good at supporting their candidates across the country. So he's drawing [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3096.5600000000004s)]
*  on that national Democratic Socialist base, and that's why he has so many donors. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3101.76s)]
*  And the DSA is formidable. That's why this is an important race. The city controller who's running [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3109.1200000000003s)]
*  for mayor is a member of the DSA. The former controller was supported by the DSA and DSA members. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3115.6800000000003s)]
*  BDS is supported by most of them. So this is a powerful movement within the Democratic Party. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3126.0s)]
*  The Democratic Socialist, pro-Palestinian, BDS, it tends to converge, but it is powerful, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3134.4s)]
*  and it is organized, and there's money behind it. Do you think the leaders of the Democratic Party, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3144.0s)]
*  do you think the leaders of the Democratic Party, people like Chuck Schumer and others, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3150.56s)]
*  should be doing more to sideline this growing movement? I don't think they know what to do. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3156.48s)]
*  I don't think they know what to do about the far left in our party. I don't think they know what [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  to do about Trump. And I think we're in a quandary as a national party. You know, you look at Trump, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3168.96s)]
*  he is playing an entirely different game than the Democrats are playing. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3180.48s)]
*  What's his game? His game is, well, Wayne Gretzky, a great ice hockey player. Not that I... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3184.88s)]
*  I know, Wayne Gretzky. Okay. I never played. But he had an expression, something like, paraphrasing, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3193.2000000000003s)]
*  don't ski, don't skate to where the puck was, skate to where the puck will be. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3201.04s)]
*  It seems like the Democrats get to Trump a day late and a dollar short, right? He's on tariffs [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3208.88s)]
*  today, but he's on China tomorrow, you know, and he's on something else the next day. And the [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3218.4s)]
*  Democrats are always a day behind. Trump has just changed the tempo of the game. He moves the game [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3226.72s)]
*  faster than the Democrats, or the media, by the way, can even catch up. By the time they catch up, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3236.72s)]
*  he's talking about something else and he's on to the next topic, you know, and they haven't figured [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3244.64s)]
*  out how to deal with that. He's just moving so quickly that they're always one step behind. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3251.52s)]
*  Do you think there's anyone in the current Democratic Party, present company excluded, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3259.52s)]
*  that has the chops to kind of outrun him or beat him in his own game? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3264.96s)]
*  I don't know. He is a formidable guy. I have fought with him many times. I know him very [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3272.4s)]
*  well. We've done a lot of things during COVID, which was a hyper intense period. He was president [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3281.2s)]
*  and I was governor. We went back and forth virtually every day. I do believe Trump will [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3287.12s)]
*  wind up destroying Trump. I believe his weakness will destroy him, which is he always goes one step [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3295.9199999999996s)]
*  too far. You know, tariffs, one step too far. He could have had a bona fide point. He could have [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3303.6s)]
*  had a strategy. I want to bring jobs back to America. The tariff system is unfair. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3311.2799999999997s)]
*  This is what we're going to do. Introduce the topic. Rah, rah, bringing jobs back to America. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3316.4s)]
*  Trump the businessman. But one step too far. Too fast, too radical. You look at his budget that [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3323.68s)]
*  he's trying to get passed. Same thing. It's going to savage, savage, poor people, cities, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3333.04s)]
*  Democratic cities, Democratic states, Medicaid, which is in a state like New York, California, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3343.04s)]
*  Illinois. It's everything for the poor people. Snap, food, housing assistance. He just decimated [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3351.52s)]
*  my old apartment HUD. So I think his tendency to go too far will be his undoing. Let's talk about [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3358.96s)]
*  another candidate in this race, Eric Adams, the actual mayor of New York City right now. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3368.0s)]
*  Did you vote for him in the last Democratic primary? Mayor Eric Adams is a friend, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3372.8s)]
*  a long time friend of mine. I served with him in the legislature in Albany. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3379.76s)]
*  Former police officer. I think he struggled as mayor because it's a big transition. One of the [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3388.7200000000003s)]
*  things, Barry, people don't talk about is do we elect people who are experienced for the job [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3397.92s)]
*  or who are competent in the job? You look at the candidates we're talking about for mayor. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3406.88s)]
*  Have they ever managed anything? Could they get a job managing a Dunkin' Donuts? When the [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3413.36s)]
*  Dunkin' Donuts manager says, do you have any management experience? And they say no. Mayor [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3420.08s)]
*  of New York, you manage 300,000 people. It's $112, $115 billion budget in that range. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3428.72s)]
*  Do you know how to manage? And well, you were a politician, you were a legislator. Yeah, but [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3434.4s)]
*  legislative skills are one thing. Executive skills are something else. I'm an executive. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3442.0s)]
*  By the way, I'd be a lousy legislator. Did you vote for him in the last Democratic primary? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3447.76s)]
*  I worked with Eric Adams when he was in the state legislature. I would have supported him. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3451.6s)]
*  I couldn't actually vote. I wasn't a New York City resident at the time. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3456.96s)]
*  So now he's running as an independent for reasons that are apparent to everybody. He, you know, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3460.96s)]
*  couldn't run in the Democratic primary because it became clear that he couldn't win given his [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3468.0s)]
*  relationship with the Trump administration and the deal and da da da da da. We don't have time to go [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3472.48s)]
*  into all of it. He's pulling it around 11%. You might be facing off against him. What would be [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3476.0s)]
*  your message to people about why they shouldn't vote for him and they should vote for you? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3482.24s)]
*  I think the mayor badly compromised himself. With Trump? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3486.32s)]
*  With Trump. And I think the situation that he created, the situation he created for himself, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3491.52s)]
*  not that he had an option. We've weaponized the criminal justice system. There's no doubt about [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3499.52s)]
*  that. That to me is the most frightening threat to democracy. But he was indicted. He didn't want to [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3506.56s)]
*  go to trial. The federal government very rarely loses at trial. You could go to jail. That's what [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3513.92s)]
*  he was faced with. Or make the deal with Trump. Trump, again, had to go so far as to make the [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3521.92s)]
*  deal so explicit. I will drop the charges if you cooperate with me on immigration. And by the way, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3530.08s)]
*  I'm going to leave a caveat that I can bring the charges back just in case you don't cooperate. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3538.56s)]
*  And that was the mayor making a deal with Trump for the mayor's own benefit. But what happened [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3547.2s)]
*  with Eric was first I think he lost the confidence of New Yorkers because New Yorkers are bottom [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3556.48s)]
*  line people and they're impatient people and they want you to make change and they want you to make [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3562.7999999999997s)]
*  change now. And in fact, the city was deteriorating under Mayor Adams. So I think he lost their [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3566.96s)]
*  confidence. And then he got into that personal mess with the U.S. attorney and he needed to [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3572.7200000000003s)]
*  get out of having a trial. So he had to make a deal with Trump. And I think people thought the deal [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3583.12s)]
*  with Trump was the mayor making a deal with Donald Trump that really only served [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3589.12s)]
*  the mayor's personal interest at the expense of the city, specifically on the issue of immigration. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3598.0s)]
*  And they really resented that. And I think that hurt him very badly. He was in a terrible position. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3605.6s)]
*  But politically, making a deal with Trump I think generates more negativity than people [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3612.64s)]
*  feel against Trump. One of the biggest obstacles among people I know who are considering voting [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3623.84s)]
*  for you is what happened during COVID, specifically the fact that you had this policy, and you know [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3629.84s)]
*  where I'm going here, that forced nursing homes to readmit residents that had COVID. And we now know [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3635.2s)]
*  that over 15,000 nursing home residents died in New York City. If you could go back, would you [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3640.72s)]
*  have changed that policy? Would you have done it differently? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3647.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Larry, this is an important point. First, if I could go back, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3649.68s)]
*  I would do many, many things differently, right? Monday morning quarterback, if you can [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3654.24s)]
*  play Monday morning quarterback, nobody ever loses a game, right? COVID, nobody had any idea what [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3659.04s)]
*  the heck we were dealing with. There were all sorts of mistakes made during COVID from the [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3664.64s)]
*  highest levels. You can get it by touch. You can't get it by touch. It's going to mutate. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3670.56s)]
*  The vaccine works. The vaccine doesn't work. But then it became political. And it was in the middle [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3677.6s)]
*  of a presidential. And let's remember what happened, because what they did here was very hurtful to a [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3684.4s)]
*  lot of people, tarnished a lot of reputations, and actually added to the pain of the nursing [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3691.04s)]
*  home families. This is in the middle of the presidential. It was very important to Trump [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3697.52s)]
*  that he not be perceived as being responsible for COVID. The first states that were affected [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3702.24s)]
*  were democratic states. Trump blamed the democratic governors for COVID, and specifically [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3709.52s)]
*  the nursing home deaths, because that was the most egregious manifestation of COVID, right? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3717.84s)]
*  So he started an investigation against the democratic governors, New York being one of them, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3722.96s)]
*  saying they mishandled nursing homes and they covered up the deaths of nursing homes. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3729.44s)]
*  It was very successful for him politically, shielded him, and then the nursing home families [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3734.88s)]
*  felt that their loved one died because of a government failure, which was really infuriating, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3744.1600000000003s)]
*  and they successfully created that. When you now go back and look at the facts, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3752.8s)]
*  everything New York state did followed federal guidance. Now, they changed the federal guidance [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3759.76s)]
*  later on. They extended the quarantine period. Really what it was was the quarantine period. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3767.28s)]
*  At first it was seven days, then it was nine days, and after seven days they sent people back [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3772.64s)]
*  to the nursing home because they were past the quarantine period. They then lengthened the [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3778.7999999999997s)]
*  quarantine period later on. But New York state followed the federal guidance, whether it was [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3784.48s)]
*  right or wrong. One can argue, but it was federal guidance. And when you now look back and count [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3792.3199999999997s)]
*  all the deaths, which they have now done exhaustively, how many died in nursing homes, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3802.72s)]
*  how many died in hospitals, how many died in every state, New York turns out to be [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  number 38 in the nation in the rate of deaths in nursing homes. Let me just punctuate that for a [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3815.2s)]
*  second because it took so much pain for so many. The rate of death per 1,000 people in nursing homes, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3824.88s)]
*  how many died, right? New York is number 38. Only 12 states had a lower rate of death in nursing homes. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3835.12s)]
*  All of this PR, all of this conservative media beaten the heck out of me for years. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3846.1600000000003s)]
*  We turn out number 38, only 12 states were better, and we had it first and we had it worst, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3854.4s)]
*  and the other state had months to prepare, and only 12 states had a lower death rate. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3862.08s)]
*  Now that didn't come out for three years, right? But that's the bottom line. It didn't happen. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3869.6s)]
*  New York did not have a higher death rate. As a matter of fact, it had one of the lowest death [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3878.08s)]
*  rates in the nation. And then the other issue is the idea that you undercounted or the New York [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3882.72s)]
*  state, New York City undercounted the number of deaths. Does this whole narrative, it seems like [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3888.24s)]
*  it pisses you off. Oh, well, it was so untrue. It really hurt the health officials who were in charge [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3893.12s)]
*  of these policies. I'm a big boy. I get the politics. I understand why they were doing it. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3903.9199999999996s)]
*  And why they had their outlets echo it over and over and over. And then it was amplified by the [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3913.12s)]
*  nursing home families who just bought into this conservative rhetoric. And then you undercounted. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3918.72s)]
*  Yeah, all of it. You now know the numbers. Forget the rumors. Number 38, counting everything. People [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3927.68s)]
*  who were in nursing homes, who went to hospitals, went back to nursing homes. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3940.08s)]
*  Number 38 in the United States of America. Only 12 states did better. We should be so thankful [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3943.84s)]
*  to the first responders in New York and the health care facilities in New York [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3950.24s)]
*  that with all we had going on, only 12 states had a lower death rate. That's something to be proud of. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3955.52s)]
*  And we demonize them. And that's part of this toxic culture in politics that turns off so many people. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3964.72s)]
*  You resigned from the governorship in August of 2021 in the wake of Attorney General Tish James, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3975.84s)]
*  this report accusing you of harassing 11 women. You maintain your innocence. I don't want to unpack [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3982.56s)]
*  the allegations, but I guess I just want to ask in hindsight, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3988.72s)]
*  do you regret how you interacted or treated some of the women you worked with? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3992.7999999999997s)]
*  Look, I said at the time, I never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable in any way. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=3997.6s)]
*  The report has turned out, has been litigated with dozens of lawyers to the tune of millions of dollars. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4006.9599999999996s)]
*  And has gone absolutely nowhere. And this was not harassment, you know. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4019.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's what has come out now after the legal review. But that was a hyper political moment, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4029.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, where we were in the height of Me Too, etc. And everything was breathless and everything [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4037.04s)]
*  was sensationalized. And any accusation, every politician tripped over themselves. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4043.44s)]
*  Oh, you have to resign, you have to resign, you have to resign. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4052.2400000000002s)]
*  Why did you resign? Do you regret resigning? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4055.2000000000003s)]
*  In retrospect, I would not have. At the time I did, I believed it would be a distraction. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4058.32s)]
*  New York, let me take you half step back. I was with Clinton through the Monica Lewinsky situation. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4070.16s)]
*  Impeach, you go to the trial. New York has a different set of laws. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4077.2799999999997s)]
*  You would have to step down immediately as governor. The lieutenant governor becomes governor. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4085.2799999999997s)]
*  And then theoretically, you'd have a right to a trial, but there has never been a trial and there's no right to a trial. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4091.2799999999997s)]
*  But there has never been a trial and there's no rules of evidence and nobody knows how it would work. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4097.92s)]
*  So it would have been chaos for a prolonged period of time in state government. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4102.24s)]
*  I believed, I actually heard my father's voice at that time. He had passed away by that time. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4109.599999999999s)]
*  But you heard his voice. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4121.36s)]
*  I heard his voice and he said, look, public service is about serving the public. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4122.32s)]
*  And if you are going to be in a position where you're actually going to be a distraction from government functioning, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4129.92s)]
*  then you should step aside, handle it, figure it out, get a lawyer, go through it and resolve it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4139.759999999999s)]
*  But don't become an impediment to government functioning. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4151.36s)]
*  That is the highly principled view that he would have advocated and which I followed. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4156.799999999999s)]
*  In retrospect, okay, I would have heard the functionality of governments. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4168.32s)]
*  Government would have been distracted. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4174.72s)]
*  It's not like they have been doing so many things, Barry, that like there would have been a significant differential. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4177.4400000000005s)]
*  And it caused me great pain. It caused my family great pain. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4188.08s)]
*  And it was all unnecessary because there was no there, there and four years later. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4195.12s)]
*  There's no there, there. I was dropped from the case, the only case that was resolved. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4202.56s)]
*  But it's just the ugliness of politics plus using the justice system as a political tool. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4211.280000000001s)]
*  That is what is really frightening. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4220.72s)]
*  17% of likely Democratic primary voters are undecided. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4223.76s)]
*  I want you to just speak directly to those people. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4228.48s)]
*  Why should they vote for you? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4231.839999999999s)]
*  And most importantly, why should they actually come out and vote? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4233.04s)]
*  Most people don't vote in primaries. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4235.839999999999s)]
*  Why is this such an important election? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4237.679999999999s)]
*  You should come out and vote because one of the reasons we're in the situation we're in [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4240.4s)]
*  is because you didn't come out and vote. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4245.2s)]
*  That's why you should come out and vote. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4247.839999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, the far left activists win the day. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4249.759999999999s)]
*  Second, you should come out and vote because the city is in real trouble [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4254.08s)]
*  and we cannot take another four years like the past four years. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4257.76s)]
*  That cannot happen. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4261.68s)]
*  We're losing too many New Yorkers. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4263.6s)]
*  The city is deteriorating too quickly. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4265.2s)]
*  And I'm a lifelong New Yorker and I love New York. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm sure if you're a New Yorker, you love New York. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4271.28s)]
*  So come out to save the city. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4274.72s)]
*  Why vote for me? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4277.28s)]
*  Because I actually have the experience and competence to do the things that need to be done. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4278.959999999999s)]
*  It's not talking about the problems. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4288.719999999999s)]
*  It's being able to enact the solutions. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4291.919999999999s)]
*  Look at what I have accomplished. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  Look at what I have built. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4297.44s)]
*  Look at what I have managed. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4299.839999999999s)]
*  I ran the state government for 11 years. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4301.36s)]
*  I got a budget done on time every year for 11 years. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  The budget is twice the city council, the city's budget. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4306.64s)]
*  Handling the city council. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  I handled the legislature that is a multiple the size of the city council. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4312.08s)]
*  Look at what I built. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4317.4400000000005s)]
*  If you want to build affordable housing. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4318.64s)]
*  Look at my position on public safety. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4321.12s)]
*  When they cut police, I added police through the MTA [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4323.04s)]
*  and said it was a mistake what they were doing. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4327.84s)]
*  So hire someone with the competence to actually do the job. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4330.160000000001s)]
*  I know it's a novel concept, but actually look at what has happened to this city [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4335.04s)]
*  and then ask yourself maybe the voters should have made a more informed choice [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4342.0s)]
*  and hired a person with the experience and competence to do the job. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4350.24s)]
*  Last question, Governor. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4355.76s)]
*  I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about the headline news today. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4357.04s)]
*  The public just found out late last night or sometime yesterday [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4361.04s)]
*  that former President Joe Biden has metastatic prostate cancer. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4365.6s)]
*  And if you turn on any cable news today, including Morning Joe [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4370.08s)]
*  where Zeke Emanuel I think was on this morning, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4373.92s)]
*  every doctor, whether they vote left or they vote right, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4376.72s)]
*  is saying that it's just extraordinarily implausible [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4379.84s)]
*  that the president of the United States, let alone anyone with pretty decent health care, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4382.72s)]
*  would have just found out that they had cancer now at the time. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4386.88s)]
*  Now at this stage, I think Zeke Emanuel said he would have had it for something like five to 10 years. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4390.32s)]
*  It's coming out this news the day before Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book Original Sin, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4396.639999999999s)]
*  which is broadly a reportage about the cover-up of Joe Biden's mental condition [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4402.5599999999995s)]
*  when he was president of the United States. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4407.759999999999s)]
*  I wondered if you wanted to comment on all of that [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4409.759999999999s)]
*  and what you think about the president's health, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4412.639999999999s)]
*  whether or not you are suspicious that that was another thing [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4415.679999999999s)]
*  that was maybe covered up maybe with good intentions [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4419.52s)]
*  by the former White House and the Biden family and what you make of all of it. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4424.320000000001s)]
*  Look, first of all, I think it's a personal tragedy. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4427.84s)]
*  I know Joe Biden many, many years. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4431.200000000001s)]
*  I worked with him when I was HUD secretary. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4433.280000000001s)]
*  I go back to his friendship with my father. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4436.72s)]
*  And he is a good, decent man. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4440.88s)]
*  He always has been. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4443.280000000001s)]
*  We've been talking a lot about the union movement [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4444.96s)]
*  connecting with working men and women. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4447.92s)]
*  He did that naturally. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4451.04s)]
*  The second question on the, could the cancer have affected his performance? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4454.96s)]
*  I'm not a doctor, but I don't know. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4459.76s)]
*  Should he have revealed it? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4466.56s)]
*  Certain things are personal and if it's not affecting your job. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4469.36s)]
*  On his ability to run again, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4475.04s)]
*  I think there were many people who were working with the president [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4481.04s)]
*  who were aware of his condition. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4488.08s)]
*  His mental condition. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4491.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4492.08s)]
*  Do I think they should have put him in that position? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4495.04s)]
*  No. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4499.68s)]
*  No. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4500.16s)]
*  But again, if you're not there and you're not in the room, you don't really know. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4501.76s)]
*  Do you think that one of the reasons Donald Trump is president [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4505.84s)]
*  or maybe the reason Donald Trump is president [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4508.24s)]
*  is because Biden didn't get out of the race earlier? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4510.24s)]
*  You know, I don't think so. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4514.08s)]
*  I think the vice president Harris had an opportunity to run the race. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4516.72s)]
*  I don't even know that it was her campaign that made a difference. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4523.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's more the things we were talking about before. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4527.12s)]
*  The disconnection by the Democratic Party. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4531.36s)]
*  That's been over a long time. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4533.5199999999995s)]
*  The dysfunction of the Democratic Party. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4535.44s)]
*  The migrant crisis, which was the fuel on the fire. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4538.64s)]
*  That was all underway. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4543.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, Governor Cuomo, are you ready for a very quick lightning round? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4546.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4549.12s)]

*  Best in what way? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4553.04s)]
*  It's a lightning round. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4555.04s)]
*  Best. I need a name. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4556.08s)]
*  Okay. Most important lesson you learned from your father, Mario Cuomo? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4558.08s)]
*  Do what you think is right the heck with everybody else. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4564.32s)]
*  Favorite non-Italian restaurant in New York City? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4567.28s)]
*  Non-Italian? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4571.04s)]
*  Non-Italian. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIhp06CNKpA&t=4572.0s)]
