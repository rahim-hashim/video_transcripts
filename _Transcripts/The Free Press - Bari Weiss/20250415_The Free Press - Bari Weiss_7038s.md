In 2025 it seems like there are two types of people. There are those who are insanely diligent about health—the people who learn everything there is to know about ingredients and food labels, the people who run every beauty or cleaning product through the EWG Working Group (a database where you can check for the presence of alleged toxins in household ingredients). We all know a few of these people. 

And then there are the rest of us: the people who go about their daily lives trying to do the best they can when it comes to health.

The problem is—as hard as most try—the world around us is laden with processed foods and chemicals. Their exact impact on the body is under intense debate. But there’s no question that America is facing a crisis of chronic illness. You don’t have to be a scientist or a doctor to see that.

There are countless experts out there—and I’m using the term expert loosely—with advice about what you should eat or shouldn’t. This advice, however, is often geared toward people who have more time and resources. So today I have someone who can thread the needle and give us practical health advice.

Dr. Mark Hyman is one of America’s most famous physicians. He has written 15 books, and he hosts a hit podcast called The Dr. Hyman Show. He is also an entrepreneur, and his new company, Function Health, is focused on empowering people to understand what is going on in their bodies through lab testing.

Hyman’s fundamental insight is that rather than treating the sickness—which is the way Western medicine has typically been practiced—we should look at the root cause and focus on preventative care. To do that, he says we need to go upstream—to look at the way our food is farmed, processed, and how we approach the grocery store. He calls it “functional medicine.”

# How to Break Your Addiction to Toxic Food, with Mark Hyman
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=0.0s)]
*  In 2025, it feels like there are two types of people. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3.84s)]
*  Those who are insanely diligent about their health. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7.88s)]
*  These are the people who learn everything there is to know about ingredients and food labels. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=11.24s)]
*  The people who run every beauty or cleaning product through a database online [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=16.12s)]
*  where you can check for the presence of alleged toxins. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=20.84s)]
*  We all know a few of these people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=24.12s)]
*  We might even love a few of these people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=25.8s)]
*  Did the producer of this show, for example, ask me if we could get a reverse osmosis water filter, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=27.96s)]
*  a hot plate and a mycotoxin-free organic coffee in the office kitchen? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=34.44s)]
*  No comment. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  And then? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=41.4s)]
*  Well, then there are the rest of us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=42.4s)]
*  The people who go about their daily lives trying to do the best they can when it comes to their health. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=44.36s)]
*  The problem is, as hard as most of us try, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=50.36s)]
*  the world around us is laden with processed foods and chemicals. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=53.56s)]
*  Now, their exact impact on the body is under intense debate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=58.2s)]
*  Perhaps scientists in the future can study my own as evidence of what the impact is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=61.84s)]
*  I am confident my body is full of things like microplastics. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  What I know is that there is no question that America is facing a crisis of chronic illness. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=70.76s)]
*  You don't have to be a scientist or a doctor to see that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=77.08s)]
*  There are countless experts, and here I'm using the word expert loosely, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=80.92s)]
*  with advice, advice about what you should eat or what you shouldn't eat. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  But this advice, I find, is often geared toward people that have time and resources [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=89.24s)]
*  and, frankly, the obsession to follow every rabbit hole and figure out what's true and what isn't. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=94.72s)]
*  Today, I have on someone who can thread the needle and give us practical health advice. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  His name is Mark Hyman. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=107.36s)]
*  Mark is one of America's most famous doctors. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=109.4s)]
*  He's written 15 books, and he hosts a hit podcast called The Dr. Hyman Show. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  He's also an entrepreneur, and his new company, Function Health, is focused on empowering people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  to understand what is going on in their bodies through lab testing, especially the testing of blood. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=123.28s)]
*  Mark's fundamental insight is commonsensical. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=129.56s)]
*  It goes like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Rather than treating the symptom or the sickness, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=134.52s)]
*  which is the way that Western medicine is typically practiced, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=137.68s)]
*  we should look at the root cause and focus on preventative care. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=141.28s)]
*  To do that, he says, we need to go upstream, to look at the way our food is farmed, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=145.52s)]
*  processed, and how we approach the grocery store aisles. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=151.52s)]
*  He calls this approach functional medicine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  And today on Honestly, we talk about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=159.12s)]
*  I ask him about the commonsensical approach we should have to medicine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=161.6s)]
*  I ask him about how Americans got so sick and how we can get better. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=166.12s)]
*  I ask him about what we should eat, how we should sleep, how we should manage stress, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=170.72s)]
*  what the environmental toxins are that we should be the most concerned about, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=175.24s)]
*  and frankly, what toxins even are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=178.24s)]
*  We also talk about mental health, community, and loneliness. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=180.68s)]
*  And if the solution to all of this is at the individualized level or at the policy level, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=184.44s)]
*  and if policy change is even possible. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  We also talk about RFK Jr., Maha, whether or not Mark is bullish or bearish on the movement, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=193.16s)]
*  all of that and so much more. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=200.32s)]
*  Most importantly and most relevantly to every person listening to this show, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=202.48s)]
*  I ask him about how we can all live better and healthier lives. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=212.04s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, welcome to Honestly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=213.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Barry. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=215.04s)]
*  So happy you're here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=216.04s)]
*  So I want to start at the beginning. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=217.04s)]
*  You're born in New York. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=219.64s)]
*  You become a doctor in 1987 and you go to rural Idaho, all places, to become a doctor, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=220.84s)]
*  to practice medicine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=229.64s)]
*  Tell me about why Idaho and what you started encountering there that surprised you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=230.84s)]
*  Well, I was in the United States. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=235.64s)]
*  I was in the United States for a year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=238.44s)]
*  Well, I was an odd duck. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=241.44s)]
*  I didn't major in pre-med. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=243.64s)]
*  I majored in Buddhism and I was very much enamored with the B generation, Jack Kerouac [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=245.44s)]
*  and William Carlos Williams, who was a rural country family doctor. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=252.04s)]
*  And I just loved his stories. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=256.64s)]
*  And that was my dream, to be a country doctor. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=258.84s)]
*  And I loved it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=261.24s)]
*  I loved just being the doctor and being able to do everything, deliver babies, run the ER and trauma. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=262.04s)]
*  And I kind of went to this residency where there were no other residents other than family doctors. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=267.84s)]
*  So we got to do everything. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  And so I wanted to do everything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=274.44s)]
*  It's like very, very 19th century. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=276.64s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=278.84s)]
*  And I was like, I went to the middle of nowhere, Idaho. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=279.84s)]
*  It was a place called Oriphe. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  Nobody's probably ever heard of it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  It's this little town of 3,500 people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=285.44s)]
*  There's not even a traffic light in the town. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=287.44s)]
*  There was no vestige of anything from sort of the 21st century, 20th century. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=290.44s)]
*  So there were no brand name anything there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=295.04s)]
*  There was no McDonald's. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=298.04s)]
*  It was just all local stuff. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, you go to China. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  How many years later? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  I went after I left Idaho. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  After four years, I went to China. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=306.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  You did homework. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  You did your homework, didn't you? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=310.04s)]
*  Why China? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=311.04s)]
*  Well, I majored in Buddhism and I had to have a language at Cornell. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=312.44s)]
*  And they were like, if you're studying all these Buddhism classes, you have to have a major. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=315.64000000000004s)]
*  And you have a lot of Asian studies credits. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=320.44s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'll do Asian studies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=322.44s)]
*  But you have to have a language. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=324.64s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, God, OK, what am I going to study? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=325.64s)]
*  Pali, Sanskrit, Korean. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=327.24s)]
*  But I'll do Chinese. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=329.44s)]
*  There's a billion people that speak Chinese. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=330.24s)]
*  And of course, being a good Jew, I love Chinese food on Sunday nights. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=331.64s)]
*  So you go to China and you end up getting really sick there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=336.24s)]
*  Tell me about what happened. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=339.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=340.44s)]
*  So I didn't get sick when I was there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=340.84s)]
*  But some people told me that the air was so polluted and there was so much mercury. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=342.44s)]
*  And they burned coal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=345.84s)]
*  So there was raw coal burned for 10 million people in the city. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=347.24s)]
*  So you had lead, mercury, all the effluent from coal, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  which was the major industry for energy there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=353.24s)]
*  And I got an air filter and I cleaned it out every day, stupidly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=357.24s)]
*  And I would kind of knock it out on the porch and I would breathe in this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=361.44s)]
*  concentrated soot, which turned out to be full of mercury. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  And I ended up, when I came back, I went from being able to ride my bike [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=367.04s)]
*  100 miles a day to barely being able to walk up the stairs. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=370.04s)]
*  I could recite the charts of 30 patients without writing any notes all day long [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  and dictate them to not being able to remember where I was at the end of a sentence. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=377.04s)]
*  And I developed sort of a sudden onset of chronic fatigue syndrome. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=380.04s)]
*  My whole system just collapsed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  And it took me a long time to figure that out. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  And I had to reverse engineer my way back to health. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=386.44s)]
*  That's really where I discovered this new framework of medicine, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=388.44s)]
*  which is thinking about the root causes, about the bodies of system as a network. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=391.24s)]
*  And that really led me down the path, which chose me. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  I didn't choose it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you basically, what I read is that you solve this poisoning in your body [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  with things that most of us do not associate with medicine. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=405.44s)]
*  No, it's true. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=409.64s)]
*  Things like sauna, diet. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=410.24s)]
*  Chelation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Chelation, which I had never heard of. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=413.64s)]
*  Maybe you will explain it to me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=415.24s)]
*  Explain it to a civilian who had never heard of it before researching for this conversation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=420.64s)]
*  Like, tell us about the, like, how did you even know that sauna could help you get better from this? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=421.24s)]
*  Were you encountering this information? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=427.64s)]
*  Because I don't even know. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=429.24s)]
*  Was Reddit a thing in like 1991? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=430.44s)]
*  Like, where are you getting it? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=432.44s)]
*  I mean, that was barely the internet. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Very back then. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=435.44s)]
*  Old man River, tell me how you found out about that and solve this stuff. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=437.04s)]
*  You know, I was really sick and I was really struggling. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=441.24s)]
*  And I had a nutritionist working at Canyon Ranch where I had a job as a medical director. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=443.24s)]
*  And she said, come to this conference with me. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  And you got to listen to this guy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, okay. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  And it was a conference on longevity. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=454.24s)]
*  And there's a guy named Jeffrey Bland who was a student of Linus Pauling speaking. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  And I said, holy shit, either this guy's a genius or he's a quack. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=459.04s)]
*  And I owe it to myself and my patients to figure out which one. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  Because what he's saying is true. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=465.24s)]
*  It turns everything in medicine upside down. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=467.04s)]
*  And what was the, like, give me the broad strokes of the message he was... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=468.64s)]
*  And the message is really quite simple. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=471.64s)]
*  Is that our whole system of medicine is based on diagnosis. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you're a doctor, you're trained very carefully in how to come to the exact diagnosis for that patient. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=476.44s)]
*  And the diagnosis is basically made by taking a medical history and doing an exam and looking at lab tests. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  And based on that collection of that data, you come up with a singular diagnosis. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=489.44s)]
*  You have rheumatoid arthritis. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=493.24s)]
*  You have, you know, reflux. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=494.64s)]
*  You have type 2 diabetes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=496.24s)]
*  You have whatever the disease is. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=498.44s)]
*  You have migraine headaches. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=499.64s)]
*  That's the end of the line when it comes to thinking in medicine. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=501.44s)]
*  And the next step that they don't take is to figure out what the root cause is. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=505.64s)]
*  Why is there rheumatoid arthritis? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  Why do you have a migraine? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  Not, oh, you have rheumatoid arthritis, take this rheumatoid arthritis drug. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=514.84s)]
*  Or you have a migraine, take the migraine drug. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  It's really about looking at why. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=521.04s)]
*  And so functional medicine, which is the medicine I practice, it's based on this framework, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=522.44s)]
*  is a kind of a new theoretical framework to look at the laws of nature. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=526.44s)]
*  What are the laws of biology? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=529.84s)]
*  If I said to you, Barry, what are the laws of physics? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=530.84s)]
*  You could probably say, well, there's gravity, there's thermodynamics, there's whatever. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=532.6400000000001s)]
*  You might not know how to write the equations, but you kind of get the gist of it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, there's laws so we can build bridges, we can send rockets to space. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  But I said, what are the laws of biology? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=542.24s)]
*  You know, I don't know, evolution. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=543.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, like there's really a very little theory of medicine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=545.44s)]
*  It's been very reactive. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=548.44s)]
*  We had Louis Pasteur say there's this bacteria that then causes a disease. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=549.44s)]
*  So pneumococcal bacteria cause pneumococcal pneumonia, treated by penicillin. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  And so we've treated everything like that in medicine. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  You've got some vector that causes some disease that requires a single drug. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=561.44s)]
*  That is completely inapplicable to chronic disease, which is a multifactorial disease, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=567.24s)]
*  multiple causes, you need to do multiple things to get people better. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  And your framework of understanding the body is quite different from root causes, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=576.04s)]
*  from understanding the body as a system, not just on symptoms, not labeling people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=581.04s)]
*  by their diagnosis, but saying, what do I have to learn next about what's causing this? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=585.24s)]
*  So we call it naming and blaming. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, we name the disease, then we blame the name for the problem. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, Barry, you have a low mood and you're crying all the time [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=594.24s)]
*  and you have no interest in sex and you can't sleep. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=598.04s)]
*  And I'm not saying you do, but I'd say you did. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=599.84s)]
*  The doctor would go, oh, you have depression. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what's causing your symptoms. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=604.24s)]
*  But depression is just a name that we give to people who share that collection of symptoms. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=605.44s)]
*  It's not the cause. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=609.24s)]
*  So how would functional medicine reframe the person that's exhibiting all these symptoms? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=610.44s)]
*  Yeah, so instead of naming and blaming, we call thinking and linking. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=615.24s)]
*  We try to start thinking once we make the diagnosis and say, what's causing this? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  So depression could be caused by a low thyroid function. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=621.6400000000001s)]
*  It could be caused by eating gluten that causes inflammation in the brain. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=625.24s)]
*  It could be caused by taking an acid blocker for decades that causes B12 deficiency [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=628.84s)]
*  or because you live and work inside and have vitamin E deficiency [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=634.44s)]
*  or because you took an antibiotic and changed your microbiome [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  or because you hate fish and you have omega-3 deficiency [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  or you eat sushi all the time and you have mercury poisoning [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  or you have pre-diabetes and that causes depression. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  And the list goes on. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=644.84s)]
*  So it's really about personalization. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=646.24s)]
*  It's about understanding the root causes. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  It's about treating the body as a system rather than symptoms. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=649.84s)]
*  And it's got a very specific operating system and methodology that allows you to treat things. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=652.44s)]
*  So I'll just give an example. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=656.84s)]
*  So I have a patient who came to see me when I was at Cleveland Clinic who had psoriatic arthritis. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=658.24s)]
*  But she also had a lot of other problems. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=662.84s)]
*  So I joke and I say I'm a holistic doctor [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=664.84s)]
*  because I take care of people with a whole list of problems. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  Like a traditional doctor, if you go, I have psoriasis and you say, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=669.6400000000001s)]
*  well, my stomach hurts, I'll go see the gastroenterologist. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=672.6400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=674.6400000000001s)]
*  Or if you have psoriasis, you say, I've got migraines, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll go see the neurologist. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=676.84s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=678.44s)]
*  What is the thing that's connecting these things underneath? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=679.44s)]
*  And so this woman came in and she was a 50-year-old business coach [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=682.24s)]
*  and she had psoriatic arthritis, which is a terrible disease. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=684.6400000000001s)]
*  She was on a drug that cost 50 grand a year. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=687.6400000000001s)]
*  She had... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=689.6400000000001s)]
*  She's usually treated with like a cancer drug. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=690.24s)]
*  I know people that have it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=692.24s)]
*  There are some cancer drugs, there are some immunosuppressive drugs. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=693.24s)]
*  And she also had migraines, she also had pre-diabetes, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=695.44s)]
*  she also had severe reflux, she also had severe irritable bowel syndrome. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=698.84s)]
*  You know, she was pre-diabetic, I said. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=702.64s)]
*  So she had all these other issues. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=704.04s)]
*  And I said to myself, well, what is the cause that links all these together? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=705.64s)]
*  What is the common phenomena that's happening? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=708.84s)]
*  She had inflammation. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=710.64s)]
*  Every one of these conditions is an inflammation problem. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=711.64s)]
*  So I'm like, well, what's causing inflammation? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=714.64s)]
*  Well, often it's gut issues and she has a lot of gut symptoms [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=715.84s)]
*  because 60% of your immune system is in your gut. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=718.84s)]
*  So I said, let's reset your gut. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=721.04s)]
*  So I gave her an antibiotic and an antifungal to clear out all the bad bugs in her gut. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=722.64s)]
*  I gave her a probiotic, a vitamin D, some fish oil, maybe a couple other things. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=726.24s)]
*  And I said, start there, let's do some testing and we'll have you come back in six weeks. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  She comes back in six weeks, she says, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=733.24s)]
*  Doc, I stopped all my medication. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=734.24s)]
*  I didn't tell you to do that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  She's like, stopped everything. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=736.64s)]
*  My psoriasis is gone, my migraines are gone, I lost 20 pounds, I have no pre-diabetes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't have any reflux, I don't have any bowel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=742.24s)]
*  And I didn't treat each one of those diseases separately. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=744.04s)]
*  I treated the system, not the symptom, not the disease. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=746.8399999999999s)]
*  When most of us go to a doctor, we don't think, civilians, normal people, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=749.44s)]
*  we don't think, what kind of medicine does my doctor practice? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=754.44s)]
*  We think they practice medicine. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  So the kind of medicine that you're just... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=760.6400000000001s)]
*  Broadly, I think people would understand, there's homeopathic medicine, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=762.6400000000001s)]
*  which is medicine from plants and nature. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  And I guess what's called allopathic medicine, which is Western medicine. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  It's like, I go to a doctor on the Upper East Side, I'm getting medicine. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  Like the good old-fashioned, or the new-fashioned kind. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=777.64s)]
*  How many people do the kind of medicine you are describing? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=781.84s)]
*  This thing called functional medicine. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  But how rare is it? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=787.24s)]
*  There's probably like 6,000 certified practitioners, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=789.64s)]
*  there's probably 100,000 or more practitioners who've taken some training. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's probably 100,000, 150,000. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  But from all different spectrums of healthcare. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=799.04s)]
*  So it could be doctors, it could be naturopaths, it could be chiropractors. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=801.84s)]
*  And what's unique about it is it is where medicine is going. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  All medicine. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  So all medicine will be this soon enough. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=812.24s)]
*  Because it's really the paradigm shift. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=814.64s)]
*  And when we look, for example, at the new science around aging, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=816.84s)]
*  and guys like Jeff Bezos and so forth are faulted at Altos Labs, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=820.44s)]
*  and they're looking at the underlying mechanisms, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=824.64s)]
*  and all the billionaires who don't want to die are basically funding a lot of this research, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=826.44s)]
*  which was completely neglected by the NIH. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=829.64s)]
*  And we thought getting older was naturally associated with chronic illness, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't have to be. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  And so they're seeing there these underlying hallmarks of aging, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=836.0400000000001s)]
*  which describe the phenomena that go wrong that lead to disease. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  And it really maps almost perfectly around functional medicine. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=842.44s)]
*  Talking about inflammation and mitochondrial function, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  your microbiome, your effect of nutrition on your health. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=848.44s)]
*  These are the things that are regulating the process of degradation of disease. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=852.6400000000001s)]
*  But the kind of medicine you're describing, this thinking and linking, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  this idea of looking... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=861.04s)]
*  Anyone who, by the way, has had a kid with something wrong, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=862.24s)]
*  who's sent from specialist to specialist, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=865.24s)]
*  will know how just logistically annoying that is. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  Forget the fact that you as the parent need to be responsible [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  for keeping track of all of the different things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=875.04s)]
*  And you as the parent are sort of putting the pieces of the puzzle together. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  And what you're saying is, as the doctor, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=881.24s)]
*  I want to put the pieces of the puzzle together for you. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=883.64s)]
*  That seems so commonsensical and intuitive. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=886.04s)]
*  Why isn't that the normal way that medicine is practiced? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=890.8399999999999s)]
*  It's historical. This is the medicine that makes sense. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=896.04s)]
*  It's where all science is pointing to. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=898.64s)]
*  It's where we're going to be practicing in 25, 50 years, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=901.04s)]
*  if not sooner, hopefully. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=903.64s)]
*  And the reason that doctors don't do this [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  is they're trained in this old paradigm, which is basically reactive. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  If your head hurts, you go to the head doctor. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=913.64s)]
*  If your joint hurts, you go to the joint doctor. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=915.04s)]
*  If your stomach hurts, you go to the stomach doctor. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=916.24s)]
*  But that's not how the bodies organize for discovering. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=918.04s)]
*  And that's where systems medicine is coming. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=920.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's where guys like Leroy Hood, who's the father of the systems biology, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=923.24s)]
*  has sort of mapped out a new framework of medicine. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=927.24s)]
*  He calls it P4 medicines. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  It's predictive. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=930.64s)]
*  It's preventive. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  It's personalized and it's participatory. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=934.04s)]
*  Meaning you have to look at where you're headed. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  And you can look at, you know, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  understanding your biology with deep biomarker analysis. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  This is probably why I created Function Health, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=941.64s)]
*  to help people understand their own biology [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=943.24s)]
*  and not just wait for something to happen. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=945.64s)]
*  And I just talked to someone this morning [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=947.64s)]
*  who did their Function Health test [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  and they had a positive autoimmune antibody level that was quite high. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=950.84s)]
*  And she had gone to her doctor and her doctor said, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=954.24s)]
*  well, maybe send you the rheumatologist. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=958.24s)]
*  So they went to the rheumatologist. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  They did a whole panel of tests. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  Nothing else showed up. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=962.24s)]
*  She said, well, we don't really know what's causing it, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=963.04s)]
*  but you have some autoimmune stuff, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  but it's not causing a lot of symptoms. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=965.64s)]
*  So we'll check it and come back. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=967.84s)]
*  When you really have an autoimmune disease, then we'll treat you. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=969.64s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=972.04s)]
*  This is the sign that your body's attacking itself. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=973.64s)]
*  So there's got to be a reason. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=976.24s)]
*  Let's investigate that reason. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=977.64s)]
*  Is it moldy house you live in on the beach? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=978.84s)]
*  Is it the toxins you've been exposed to? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=981.24s)]
*  Is it something you're eating in your gut? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=983.04s)]
*  So we can start to navigate to the root causes. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=985.04s)]
*  And that's what's really different about this model. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=988.04s)]
*  And it's a new theory of medicine. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=990.04s)]
*  E.O. Wilson, as I read his book, Consilience, the Unity of Knowledge, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=991.84s)]
*  he talked about this sort of framework [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=994.84s)]
*  that connects all these disciplines together [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=996.84s)]
*  in sort of social sciences. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=999.44s)]
*  And he said there's no theory of medicine. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1001.84s)]
*  And I was like, aha, that's it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1003.44s)]
*  Like this is what this is attempting to do, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1004.84s)]
*  is create a heuristic to help understand your biology. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  What are the incentives stopping everyone [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1009.44s)]
*  from sort of adopting this framework overnight? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  Like why are you the vanguard of the vanguard of this thing? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  What is stopping this from taking hold? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1020.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you ever heard of the book, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1023.84s)]
*  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1025.64s)]
*  You talked about this idea of normal science. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1027.64s)]
*  It's very hard to change people's mind. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1029.8400000000001s)]
*  The earth is flat. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1031.64s)]
*  The sun revolves around the earth. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1033.04s)]
*  Species evolve in their fixed state. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1034.84s)]
*  Burn Galileo for saying otherwise. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1036.84s)]
*  Yeah, so this is where we're at in medicine right now. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  And we have a whole generation of physicians [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1041.04s)]
*  who've been training this whole model [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1043.84s)]
*  and can't see the way they see what they were seeing, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1045.44s)]
*  which is what Artie Lang said. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1047.6399999999999s)]
*  Scientists can't see the way they see what they were seeing. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1049.24s)]
*  Because they have a very fixed view of how things are. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1051.04s)]
*  And so you can't see the symptoms, the signs, the clues, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1053.84s)]
*  and the data that tell you a different story. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  So I look at the same data. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1059.04s)]
*  I just see a different story. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1060.04s)]
*  And I see a different story because I've been trained in this model. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1061.64s)]
*  And the other reason is we have a reimbursement-based medical system. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1064.8400000000001s)]
*  So doctors do what they get paid to do, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1069.64s)]
*  not what the science says they should do. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1072.24s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  And that has to shift. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  And hopefully with this sort of new change of the NIH [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1077.0400000000002s)]
*  and maybe with what's happening with Dr. Oz taking over Medicare, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1080.44s)]
*  there's going to be an effort to start to look at things differently. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1084.44s)]
*  And I've actually had conversations with the Center for Medicare [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1086.64s)]
*  and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1090.44s)]
*  which does pilot programs to look at innovations [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1092.24s)]
*  that can make a difference in health care. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1095.24s)]
*  And they actually called me and said, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  can you talk to us about functional medicine? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1098.04s)]
*  What can we do to start to study this? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1099.44s)]
*  And how do we look at this as a new paradigm [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1101.24s)]
*  to improve people's health outcomes and reduce costs? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1103.24s)]
*  So I think it's happening. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1105.24s)]
*  But medical schools and science changes very slowly. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1106.8400000000001s)]
*  Max Planck said, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1110.24s)]
*  science doesn't evolve by convincing your opponents [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1111.24s)]
*  and helping them see the light, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1113.8400000000001s)]
*  because they eventually die and a new generation grows up with it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  Basically, medicine advances one funeral at a time. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1117.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1120.04s)]
*  Well, I think we're talking at a very, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1121.04s)]
*  we're talking at a moment of great opportunity, I think, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1124.04s)]
*  because no one at this point can, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1128.04s)]
*  let's put to the side for a second the politics of it, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1131.04s)]
*  which we will get to, what's happening at the NIH, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1135.04s)]
*  RFK, all of that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1138.04s)]
*  What everyone acknowledges is that [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1140.04s)]
*  what we're doing is not working. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1143.04s)]
*  Americans are unbelievably sick. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1145.04s)]
*  3% of Americans are obese. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1148.04s)]
*  6 in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1150.04s)]
*  In an elevator pitch, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1153.04s)]
*  and I know it's like its own separate, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1155.04s)]
*  extremely long conversation, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1157.04s)]
*  how did we get there? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1158.04s)]
*  Great question. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1160.04s)]
*  How did we get so sick? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1161.04s)]
*  Well, this is the most important question. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1162.04s)]
*  Why do we spend more than twice any other nation on health care [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1164.04s)]
*  and we're 48th in life expectancy? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1167.04s)]
*  Why were we 4% of the world's population [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1169.04s)]
*  and had 16% of the COVID cases and deaths? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1171.04s)]
*  Because we're a sick country [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1174.04s)]
*  and we're getting sicker and sicker. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1176.04s)]
*  And so what's happened is that over the last 60 years, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1178.04s)]
*  we've seen the change in our diet. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1180.04s)]
*  We've seen the industrialization of farming. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1182.04s)]
*  We've seen the increased use of chemicals and pesticides [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1184.04s)]
*  and toxins in our environment. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1187.04s)]
*  And it's this sort of soup we're living in [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1189.04s)]
*  that's a disease creating soup. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1191.04s)]
*  So the ultra-processed food is now 60% of adults' diet, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1194.04s)]
*  67% of kids' diet. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1197.04s)]
*  That's very harmful and causing obesity and type 2 diabetes. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1200.04s)]
*  When I graduated from medical school, Barry, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1203.04s)]
*  there was a single state that had an obesity rate over 20%. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1205.04s)]
*  And now there's not a single state under 30. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1209.04s)]
*  So that's the mid-1980s. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1211.04s)]
*  This is from 1990, yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1213.04s)]
*  For 40 years since then. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1215.04s)]
*  That is like an astonishing decline. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1217.04s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1219.04s)]
*  And we didn't have type 2 diabetes. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1220.04s)]
*  When I was in medical school, it was called adult onset [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1223.04s)]
*  and juvenile diabetes. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1225.04s)]
*  They changed the name because kids started getting type 2 diabetes. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1227.04s)]
*  Never saw it when I was in training. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1230.04s)]
*  And so we've seen this explosion of disease. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1232.04s)]
*  We have the best medicine in the world. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1234.04s)]
*  We're spending more and more. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1236.04s)]
*  We're getting less and less. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1238.04s)]
*  In 2000, we spent $1.6 trillion on health care. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1239.04s)]
*  Now we're spending almost $5 billion on health care. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1241.04s)]
*  It's almost $1.5 billion of our GDP. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1244.04s)]
*  It's staggering. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1246.04s)]
*  And most of that is not resulting in better health. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1248.04s)]
*  So nobody's stopping and going, why? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1251.04s)]
*  You know, it's not about Medicare for all. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1253.04s)]
*  It's not about reducing entitlements. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1255.04s)]
*  It's about why are people getting sick in the first place? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1257.04s)]
*  And how do we deal with that? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1260.04s)]
*  So what's the big reason? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1261.04s)]
*  Why are we getting so sick in the first place? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1262.04s)]
*  I think it's pretty much two reasons. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1264.04s)]
*  It's the role of our diet and an incredible increase in starch [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1266.04s)]
*  and sugar in our diet and ultra-processed food, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1269.04s)]
*  which I think the average American eats about 152 pounds of sugar [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1272.04s)]
*  and 133 pounds of flour per year, almost 3 quarters of a pound a day. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1275.04s)]
*  That's a pharmacologic dose, which is destroying our metabolism. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1279.04s)]
*  And second, we live in a soup of toxins, whether it's heavy metals, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1282.04s)]
*  pesticides, herbicides, chemicals in our food, additives. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1286.04s)]
*  I don't want to live in a soup of toxins. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1289.04s)]
*  That sounds disgusting. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1291.04s)]
*  We do. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1292.04s)]
*  Are we in it right now? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1293.04s)]
*  I mean, if we were food, Barry, we would not be safe to eat. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1294.04s)]
*  We'd be on the don't eat list, like swordfish or mercury to laden tuna. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1297.04s)]
*  So we're pretty toxic. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1302.04s)]
*  And I think I've spent my life studying the role of diet [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1304.04s)]
*  and the role of environmental toxins in our health. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1308.04s)]
*  And I've been deep in investigating their consequences on human biology [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1310.04s)]
*  and actually testing for these compounds in people. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1313.04s)]
*  And it's staggering. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1316.04s)]
*  I mean, the Environmental Working Group did a study of 10 newborns. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1317.04s)]
*  They took their umbilical cord blood, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1320.04s)]
*  before they'd even taken their first breath. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1322.04s)]
*  It's like full of plastics. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1325.04s)]
*  There were 287 toxins in their umbilical cord blood. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1326.04s)]
*  And 207 or something were neurotoxic, heavy metals, pesticides. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1329.04s)]
*  I mean, DDT, which has been banned, lindane, which has been banned, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1335.04s)]
*  dioxin, which is Agent Orange. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1338.04s)]
*  I mean, all this stuff is in us. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1340.04s)]
*  Okay, I want to get to toxins because I got to say, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1342.04s)]
*  it's one of those words that for me, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1345.04s)]
*  it's one of those filler words that's a little bit been leeched of meaning [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1347.04s)]
*  because I see so many hot Instagram influencers [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1350.04s)]
*  saying like, I'm detoxing myself. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1353.04s)]
*  But I do want to get to it and understand. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1355.04s)]
*  I mean, the LI Fire is a great example. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1358.04s)]
*  There was an article in the New York Times recently about the firefighters [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1360.04s)]
*  who have extremely high levels of lead and mercury in their blood [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1363.04s)]
*  as a consequence of being- [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1366.04s)]
*  But that makes sense, right? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1368.04s)]
*  The idea that you would be clearing the rubble of 9-11 and getting cancer [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1369.04s)]
*  given what was burned there, that intuitively makes sense. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1374.04s)]
*  Where I start to lose the thread is when 24-year-olds in hot yoga pants [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1378.04s)]
*  are telling me about like- [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1384.04s)]
*  They're cleansed. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1386.04s)]
*  They're cleansed. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1387.04s)]
*  So let's get to it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1388.04s)]
*  Let's stay on diet for a minute because I think that's one [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1389.04s)]
*  where there's like a much broader consensus and a much broader understanding. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1392.04s)]
*  You said in a recent interview that we live in a nutritional wasteland. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1396.04s)]
*  How can it be that we are one of the wealthiest societies in the history of the world [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1402.04s)]
*  living in a way that our ancestors only would have dreamed of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1407.04s)]
*  with conveniences that are almost like out of the Jetsons? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1410.04s)]
*  We live like kings. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1416.04s)]
*  The poorest people live like kings. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1418.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1420.04s)]
*  How did America become a nutritional wasteland? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1421.04s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1423.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, my great grandparents grew up in the Lower East Side [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1424.04s)]
*  and they came over from Russia and Poland. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1429.04s)]
*  And then my mother told the story of like my grandmother going to the market [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1432.04s)]
*  and getting carp and putting it in this bathtub [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1435.04s)]
*  and making a filter fish out of it on Passover. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1438.04s)]
*  A true delicacy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1440.04s)]
*  Or my grandmother like going to like pluck chickens, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1442.04s)]
*  get a nickel to go to the movies. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1444.04s)]
*  And so we had a very different food system before World War II. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1447.04s)]
*  So fast forward to the end of World War II, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1451.04s)]
*  you've got bomb factories making bombs with nitrogen. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1453.04s)]
*  And you've got bio weapons, neurotoxic, basically biological weapons [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1457.04s)]
*  that nobody knew what to do with these factories. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1463.04s)]
*  They turned into pesticides and herbicides and also fertilizer. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1466.04s)]
*  Remember Timothy McVeigh, he just used fertilizer [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1471.04s)]
*  to blow up the building in Oklahoma, right? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1473.04s)]
*  And that's what we've done. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1476.04s)]
*  We industrialized agriculture. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1478.04s)]
*  At the same time, it's like we need to feed a growing, hungry world. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1479.04s)]
*  So let's industrialize agriculture. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1482.04s)]
*  It was the modern era. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1484.04s)]
*  Better living through chemistry with DuPont. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1485.04s)]
*  It was like all that at the World Fair. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1487.04s)]
*  I mean, I was alive then. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1489.04s)]
*  It was in Queens. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1490.04s)]
*  I actually went to it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1491.04s)]
*  You know, that big globe. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1492.04s)]
*  And so we started growing industrial agriculture [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1494.04s)]
*  with big machinery, with industrialization, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1500.04s)]
*  with commodity crops. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1503.04s)]
*  And we grew a lot of starchy calories. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1504.04s)]
*  And that got turned into processed food. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1507.04s)]
*  And then we started getting the sort of Betty Crocker, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1511.04s)]
*  which was like, I don't know if you know Betty Crocker. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1513.04s)]
*  It was not a real person. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1515.04s)]
*  Of course I know Betty Crocker. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1516.04s)]
*  But she was not a real person. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1517.04s)]
*  She was a persona. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1519.04s)]
*  She was a fiction that was developed by the food industry [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1520.04s)]
*  to fight Betty, who was a home ec teacher [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1523.04s)]
*  who wanted to teach families across the country [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1526.04s)]
*  how to actually grow food and cook. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1529.04s)]
*  And there were federal extension workers that went around the country [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1531.04s)]
*  teaching young families and mothers how to actually eat cook [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1534.04s)]
*  and eat fresh stuff. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1537.04s)]
*  And the food industry freaked out about this. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1538.04s)]
*  They had a big meeting in Minnesota [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1540.04s)]
*  with General Mills and the crew. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1542.04s)]
*  And they basically were like, we're going to make Convenience King. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1544.04s)]
*  And so they created the Betty Crocker Cookbook. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1546.04s)]
*  And remember the recipes. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1548.04s)]
*  Add one can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1549.04s)]
*  or add one roll of Ritz crackers to your casserole. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1552.04s)]
*  And then there was the TV dinners. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1555.04s)]
*  And then there was Tang, the drink of astronauts. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1556.04s)]
*  And then there was Fleischmann's margarine, you know, better than butter. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1559.04s)]
*  And then we sort of got this idea that industrial food was great. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1561.04s)]
*  It was better for us. It was good. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1565.04s)]
*  It was saving us from all these problems. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1566.04s)]
*  And it turned out to be a total disaster. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1568.04s)]
*  And now we have 500 calories more per person a day than we did in the 1970s [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1571.04s)]
*  because Earl Butts under President Nixon was told to fix agriculture [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1578.04s)]
*  in order to actually bring down the price of meat and milk [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1583.04s)]
*  because Nixon was worried about getting reelected. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1586.04s)]
*  And he said basically go big or go home. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1588.04s)]
*  And it was the... [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1591.04s)]
*  Wendell Bear wrote a book about this called The Unsettling of America. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1592.04s)]
*  It was about the destruction of family farms and the centralization [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1595.04s)]
*  and the aggregation of big agricultural sort of organizations. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1599.04s)]
*  And so we've got a co-opted system that isn't really growing real food [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1603.04s)]
*  and it's turned into commodity crops. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1607.04s)]
*  So those commodity crops are turned into processed foods, soy, corn, wheat. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1609.04s)]
*  And they're not in their natural forms. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1613.04s)]
*  So 5% of the corn grown is eaten by humans. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1614.04s)]
*  The rest is turned into animal feed. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1616.04s)]
*  Or just the products for industrial like maltodextrin or all kinds of weird chemicals. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1618.04s)]
*  Oreos. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1623.04s)]
*  Yeah, basically. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1624.04s)]
*  That kind of thing. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1625.04s)]
*  How important is feminism to the story you're telling? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1626.04s)]
*  Meaning there's a more... [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1629.04s)]
*  It's interesting. Betty Friedman. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1632.04s)]
*  There's just a different story to tell I think where... [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1634.04s)]
*  Or a different slice of the story. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1636.04s)]
*  Where women were liberated thanks to the pill of feminism. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1638.04s)]
*  Women play, they've got out of the kitchen. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1643.04s)]
*  They want to get out of the kitchen. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1644.04s)]
*  It's a structure, it gives bad work. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1645.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1646.04s)]
*  And all of a sudden they had... [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1647.04s)]
*  You deserve a break today. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1649.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1650.04s)]
*  How important is that to the story? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1651.04s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1653.04s)]
*  I think it kind of... [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1654.04s)]
*  The industrialization of our food system and the rise of ultra-processed food sort of coincided [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1655.04s)]
*  with this liberation from the kitchen. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1663.04s)]
*  And basically the food industry took advantage of that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1665.04s)]
*  And they hijacked the American kitchen. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1668.04s)]
*  They disenfranchised us from it. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1670.04s)]
*  And it's left a whole generation of Americans who do not know how to cook. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1672.04s)]
*  And don't know how to take care of themselves. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1675.04s)]
*  And don't know the basic life skills. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1677.04s)]
*  We got rid of home ec in school. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1678.04s)]
*  And so all of a sudden you have people who just don't know how to take care of themselves. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1680.04s)]
*  And don't know the most basic fundamental things about how to take care of their nutritional needs. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1684.04s)]
*  And the generational knowledge and wisdom that should have been passed down has not. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1689.04s)]
*  And the American family, the American wife, mother, whatever, father, whoever, I was a single father, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1694.04s)]
*  basically got disintermediated from the kitchen. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1701.04s)]
*  And that's a big problem. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1704.04s)]
*  I mean I was part of this movie called Fed Up with Katie Kirk and Laurie David. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1706.04s)]
*  They did it in like 2014. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1710.04s)]
*  I think it's still on Netflix. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1712.04s)]
*  And we basically, it was about childhood obesity. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1713.04s)]
*  And we went down to South Carolina, to this small town called Easley. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1715.04s)]
*  And there was a family of five that lived in a trailer on food stamps and disability. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1718.04s)]
*  The mother was huge, probably 100 plus pounds overweight. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1722.04s)]
*  The father was 42, already on dialysis for type 2 diabetes from kidney failure. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1725.04s)]
*  At 42. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1729.04s)]
*  At 42. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1730.04s)]
*  The son was like huge. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1731.04s)]
*  The 16 year old, 50% body fat should be like 10, 15% at that age. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1732.04s)]
*  He's like, Dr. Hyman, am I going to become 100% body fat? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1736.04s)]
*  I'm like, no, you have muscle symbol. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1739.04s)]
*  And I went in their trailer. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1741.04s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to give you a lecture on what to eat. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1744.04s)]
*  The father wanted to get better because they wanted the father to get a new kidney because he couldn't get one if he didn't lose weight. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1746.04s)]
*  And he didn't know how to lose weight. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1750.04s)]
*  And they were trying to low fat this and all this sort of propaganda they were getting from the food industry. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1751.04s)]
*  And I said, let's look at your kitchen. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1756.04s)]
*  We went through the cupboard. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1757.04s)]
*  We went through the freezer. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1758.04s)]
*  We went through their fridge. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1759.04s)]
*  And I showed them what the ingredients were. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1760.04s)]
*  I explained to them what they did. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1761.04s)]
*  I said, here's trans fats. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1762.04s)]
*  Here's high fructose corn syrup. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1763.04s)]
*  Here's all these atoms and what they do to your biology. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1764.04s)]
*  Here's how they affect your body and inflammation. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1765.04s)]
*  And they were like shocked. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1766.04s)]
*  I said, rather than me giving you a lecture, let's just cook a meal together. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1767.04s)]
*  So I gave them a guide called Good Food and a Tight Budget from the Environmental Working Group. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1768.04s)]
*  How to eat well for your wallet, good for the planet, and good for your health. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1769.04s)]
*  And we made turkey chili. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1770.04s)]
*  We made a fresh salad with some olive oil and vinegar. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1771.04s)]
*  Now let's talk about dressing. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1772.04s)]
*  We made this roasted sweet potatoes. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1773.04s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1774.04s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1775.04s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1776.04s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1777.04s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1778.04s)]
*  they didn't have cutting boards. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1779.6599999999999s)]
*  They never cooked a single thing in their kitchen in their life. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1790.84s)]
*  Everything was from a box, a packet you can. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1795.0s)]
*  They were like, this is delicious. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1800.0s)]
*  And the son said to me, Dr. Hyman, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1801.46s)]
*  do you eat like this with your family every night? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1804.04s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I do. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1805.86s)]
*  And you can do it too. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1807.24s)]
*  I said, here's the guide, here's my cookbook. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1808.62s)]
*  On the way home, I sent them some cutting boards [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1811.72s)]
*  and some knives from Amazon. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1814.06s)]
*  And the first week, the mother texted me back, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1816.02s)]
*  we lost 18 pounds together this week. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1817.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1819.78s)]
*  And they lived in one of the worst food deserts in America. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1820.62s)]
*  Then they lost 200 pounds as a family the first year. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1823.54s)]
*  The father got a new kidney. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1826.68s)]
*  The mother lost over 100 pounds. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1828.16s)]
*  And the son lost about 50, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1829.28s)]
*  then went to work at Bojangles, gained it back. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1830.48s)]
*  But then later reached out to me and said, can you help me? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1832.24s)]
*  And I coached him. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1834.32s)]
*  And he lost 132 pounds. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1835.48s)]
*  First came to his family to go to college. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1837.12s)]
*  Then he wrote me a letter and email, said, Dr. Hyman, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1839.16s)]
*  could you write me a letter of recommendation [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1841.36s)]
*  for medical school? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1843.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1844.3799999999999s)]
*  He went to medical school and he was a doctor. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1845.72s)]
*  So it taught me that we're literally one meal away [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1847.44s)]
*  from transforming the health of America. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1849.92s)]
*  And I've done this in a Cleveland Clinic. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1851.4s)]
*  We worked at Langston Hughes, which was really underserved, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1853.16s)]
*  extremely underserved area of African-Americans. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1855.8799999999999s)]
*  And we were full of diabetes, hypertension, kidney failure, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1860.18s)]
*  you name it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1863.18s)]
*  And we did group programs and we showed [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1864.02s)]
*  that people want to change. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1865.5800000000002s)]
*  They want to do the right thing. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1866.98s)]
*  They don't want to be sick. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1867.82s)]
*  Nobody wakes up and says, I want to have diabetes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1868.66s)]
*  I want to have kidney failure. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1870.5s)]
*  I want to have hypertension. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1871.5800000000002s)]
*  They're like, I want to be obese. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1872.42s)]
*  I'm just going to. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1873.26s)]
*  People are literally have their, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1874.1000000000001s)]
*  not only their kitchens hijacked, but their brains, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1875.82s)]
*  their metabolism, their hormones, their immune system, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1878.26s)]
*  all hijacked by the food we're eating, which is a poison. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1880.82s)]
*  So food can kill or food can heal. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1884.1200000000001s)]
*  And we're in a situation where technically [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1887.2s)]
*  the things people are eating in America [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1890.16s)]
*  are not actually food. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1891.5600000000002s)]
*  If you look at the Webster's Dictionary Definition of Food, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1892.76s)]
*  it's something that nourishes the growth [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1895.44s)]
*  and health of being organism, right? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1897.3600000000001s)]
*  That is not what this stuff does. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1899.48s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1901.3200000000002s)]
*  Does that answer your question? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1903.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1903.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about food that heals. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1905.26s)]
*  I think people would just be really interested to know [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1907.4s)]
*  as someone who is totally steeped in this, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1910.0s)]
*  what your diet looks like. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1912.48s)]
*  What you eat in a day. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  What do I eat? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1914.92s)]
*  Yeah, what do you eat? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1915.76s)]
*  Can I zoom out for a sec? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1916.84s)]
*  Yeah, what do you avoid and what do you eat? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1917.9399999999998s)]
*  I think the first concept people understand is that [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1919.62s)]
*  food is not just calories, it's medicine, it's information, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1921.62s)]
*  it's instructions, it's code. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1925.3s)]
*  And it literally changes your biology with every single bite. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1927.1s)]
*  So everything you eat affects your microbiome, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1930.12s)]
*  affects your gene expression, affects your epigenome, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1932.58s)]
*  which is the sort of meta, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1935.3s)]
*  sort of control system for your genes, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1937.3s)]
*  affects your immune system, affects your brain chemistry, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1939.4199999999998s)]
*  affects your metabolism. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1942.08s)]
*  Everything is affected in real time [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1943.1799999999998s)]
*  by the informational quality of the food. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1945.3s)]
*  So if you eat, for example, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1947.76s)]
*  you eat trans fat, gram for gram, as omega-3 fats. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1950.0s)]
*  Trans fat is basically shortening. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1953.78s)]
*  They call it shortening because it shortens your life. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1955.68s)]
*  And omega-3 fats from fish roe. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1958.28s)]
*  If you give those to a person in the same amount dose, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1961.08s)]
*  the trans fat will bind a receptor [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1964.2s)]
*  on your nucleus of your cells and will slow your metabolism, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1966.02s)]
*  will cause diabetes, will cause inflammation. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1969.36s)]
*  If you bind the same amount of fat [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1971.68s)]
*  to the same receptor on your nucleus, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1974.18s)]
*  does the exact opposite. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1976.3200000000002s)]
*  Speeds up your metabolism, reduces inflammation, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1977.28s)]
*  and helps you address and correct [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1979.44s)]
*  your metabolism and diabetes. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1981.0s)]
*  So it's the information in food that matters. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1982.88s)]
*  And it's not only the protein, the fat, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1985.48s)]
*  and the carbohydrates and the quality of those, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  not only the vitamins and minerals and the fiber, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1989.88s)]
*  but it's also the phytochemicals. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1991.44s)]
*  And there's probably 100,000 phytochemicals in food, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1992.8s)]
*  which are plant medicines [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1995.46s)]
*  that are there for the plant to defend itself, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1997.24s)]
*  but that we've co-evolved with, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=1999.2s)]
*  that interact with our biology. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2000.98s)]
*  So eat broccoli, why eat broccoli? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2001.8999999999999s)]
*  Because it up-regulates pathways that help you detoxify [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2003.7s)]
*  and increases something called glutathione [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2006.96s)]
*  that helps you metabolize environmental toxins. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2008.5s)]
*  I eat lots of broccoli for that reason. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2010.9399999999998s)]
*  So when I think what I'm eating, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2012.86s)]
*  when I go to the grocery store, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2014.9199999999998s)]
*  I think of it as my pharmacy, F-A-R-M-A-C-Y. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2016.1799999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2019.62s)]
*  And I look around, I go, oh, the ginger's going to do this, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2020.46s)]
*  the garlic's going to do this, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2023.26s)]
*  this dandelion green's going to help me with this. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2024.6599999999999s)]
*  And I literally, because I know the food, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2028.46s)]
*  because that's what I've done for my life, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2030.94s)]
*  I think of it and I see a medicine cabinet. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2031.9s)]
*  But it's like learning a second language a little bit, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2033.94s)]
*  what you're describing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2036.14s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't have to do it like I do it, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2036.98s)]
*  because I'm a weirdo. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2038.5800000000002s)]
*  But I'm just saying, for most people, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2039.8200000000002s)]
*  they just don't think that way. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2041.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you have to understand that when you eat something, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2043.18s)]
*  it is interacting with your biology. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2045.74s)]
*  And you would not feed your dog [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2047.7s)]
*  what you feed yourself or your kids, right? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2049.9s)]
*  You feed your dog the best food. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2052.86s)]
*  The amount of money people spend on pets [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2055.9s)]
*  is more than we spend on education in America. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2057.06s)]
*  So what do you eat? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2058.9s)]
*  What do I have for breakfast? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2060.9s)]
*  So this morning I had a protein shake. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2061.74s)]
*  I worked out, I had a protein shake. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2063.14s)]
*  And I got it at Equinox, because I'm traveling. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2065.34s)]
*  But at home I'll have a protein shake, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2068.5s)]
*  I'll put in frozen berries. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2069.78s)]
*  I often use goat whey or whey protein. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2071.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll have creatine in it, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2074.3s)]
*  because it helps with brain health, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2075.5s)]
*  helps with muscle strength. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2076.66s)]
*  As I'm getting older, I need more of that. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2077.7s)]
*  And I put a few other things in. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2079.38s)]
*  I put in Himalayan tartar buckwheat powder, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2081.34s)]
*  sprouted powder, which has all these phytochemicals. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2083.14s)]
*  It's like 132 phytochemicals that reduce inflammation, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2085.18s)]
*  rejuvenate your immune system. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2087.7s)]
*  And I kind of mix it all up. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2088.98s)]
*  And then I put the blender, and it's kind of a yummy shake. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2090.14s)]
*  Or I might have eggs and avocados [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2092.34s)]
*  and tomatoes with olive oil. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2094.98s)]
*  So I have fat and protein for breakfast, not sugar. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2096.1s)]
*  And the problem in America is that we basically [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2098.78s)]
*  have dessert for breakfast. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2101.38s)]
*  Whether it's a Starbucks latte, shmattay, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2102.94s)]
*  whatever they got there. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2106.02s)]
*  Or whether it's muffins or bagels or toast or cereal. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2107.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm a cereal killer. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  I want to get rid of cereal. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2114.26s)]
*  It is the worst human invention. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2115.7s)]
*  Not just because of all the chemicals and additives [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2117.54s)]
*  like Froot Loops you probably heard about recently [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2119.14s)]
*  with Kellogg's. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2120.62s)]
*  Of course, but I'm thinking about, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2121.46s)]
*  remember when we grew up, or I'll speak for myself, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2123.3s)]
*  when I grew up. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2125.98s)]
*  Captain Crunch. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2126.82s)]
*  No, just the food pyramid. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2127.66s)]
*  What was the basis of the food pyramid? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2129.18s)]
*  Pasta, bread, and cereal. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2132.22s)]
*  Six to 11 servings of bread, rice, cereal, and pasta. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2134.62s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2137.1s)]
*  If you're saying it's evil, basically. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2138.02s)]
*  Well, it's a long story. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2141.06s)]
*  I've written many books about it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2142.86s)]
*  But I'll give you the short version. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2143.82s)]
*  My joke, Barry, you like this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2146.26s)]
*  The short history of Jewish holidays, you know what it is? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2147.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes, they tried to kill us. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2150.2200000000003s)]
*  We survived, let's eat. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2151.5s)]
*  That's right, they tried to kill us, we won, let's eat. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2152.5s)]
*  But basically, the short history of the food pyramid [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2154.94s)]
*  is that in the 60s, there was a guy named Ansel Keys [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2158.34s)]
*  who was a very prominent doctor who convinced the world [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2162.2200000000003s)]
*  that fat was the evil enemy. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2165.94s)]
*  And there were a couple of nutritionists at Harvard [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2168.86s)]
*  who were paid by the sugar industry [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2171.1400000000003s)]
*  to reinforce that narrative. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2174.42s)]
*  And it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2176.78s)]
*  before there was peer review. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2178.34s)]
*  They were very prominent nutrition scientists [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2180.02s)]
*  at Harvard at the time. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2182.02s)]
*  And that led to this wave of belief [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2183.58s)]
*  that fat was bad and carbs were good. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2185.98s)]
*  And then came the McGovern Report, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2189.66s)]
*  which was basically the first look [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2191.62s)]
*  at dietary guidelines for Americans. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2193.62s)]
*  And this was because there was an increase in heart disease. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2195.34s)]
*  And they were like, what's going on [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2197.42s)]
*  and what's causing it, and it's at the fat. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2198.46s)]
*  And so they basically came up with this idea [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2200.38s)]
*  that we should be eating more carbs and less fat. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2201.9s)]
*  So remember the food pyramid had fat and oils [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2205.1400000000003s)]
*  at the very tippy top. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2206.0600000000004s)]
*  And at the bottom was like. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2207.38s)]
*  Fat was bad. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2208.46s)]
*  Yeah, and we got snack well cookies [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2210.7000000000003s)]
*  and low fat everything. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2212.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2213.26s)]
*  I went through all, I mean, I was in a family [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2214.1800000000003s)]
*  that it was always like, you know, the egg beaters, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2215.7400000000002s)]
*  the margarine, the snack, I mean, all of it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2219.54s)]
*  You name it, we've done it, Boca burgers, like all of it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2222.54s)]
*  Your low fat sweetened yogurt in the morning [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2225.42s)]
*  has more sugar per ounce than a can of Coke. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2228.3s)]
*  And so what happened was we saw, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2231.26s)]
*  with the change in agriculture to increase production [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2233.4199999999996s)]
*  of commodity crops, we saw this extra 500 calories [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2236.66s)]
*  of basically sugar into the marketplace. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2239.58s)]
*  That all got dumped into ultra processed food. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2241.74s)]
*  And this whole sort of sequence of historical events [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2243.54s)]
*  led to this belief that sugar and carbs were good [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2246.46s)]
*  and that was bad. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2250.98s)]
*  And that's what the food pyramid was. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2252.62s)]
*  So we need a reinvention of the food pyramid [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2254.3399999999997s)]
*  and put fat and protein at the bottom and veggies [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2255.8599999999997s)]
*  and put sugar and starch at the top. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2259.2999999999997s)]
*  But was the other reason just that stuff [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2261.2599999999998s)]
*  is cheaper for people? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2262.74s)]
*  It doesn't have to be. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2264.7799999999997s)]
*  And if you look at, and this is a lot of published data [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2266.46s)]
*  on this about the belief, and I'm glad you said that, Barry, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2269.46s)]
*  because the narrative of the food industry is so subversive. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2272.3799999999997s)]
*  It gets into the culture and it convinces people [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2276.14s)]
*  who don't know better. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2278.4199999999996s)]
*  It's more expensive to eat healthy. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2280.8999999999996s)]
*  It's elitist. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2283.22s)]
*  It's, you know, all calories are the same. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2284.7799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's coke calories [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2287.86s)]
*  or broccoli calories, as long as you don't exceed [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2289.5s)]
*  your limit, your metabolism will be fine. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2292.46s)]
*  You won't gain weight. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2293.82s)]
*  This is all propaganda from the food industry. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2295.06s)]
*  It's invaded our culture and convinced people [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2297.94s)]
*  of the wrong ideas about nutrition. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2300.42s)]
*  And so it's not more expensive. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2302.46s)]
*  If you look at this family of five, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2304.1800000000003s)]
*  they lived on $1,000 on food stamps and disability. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2306.6600000000003s)]
*  They were able to do it because they just knew [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2309.7000000000003s)]
*  how to buy cheaper vegetables, cheaper cuts of meat. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2312.1s)]
*  I mean, you're Jewish. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2315.1s)]
*  I mean, I grew up like cabbage borscht [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2316.18s)]
*  with like the cheapest piece of meat, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2317.74s)]
*  and you throw in cabbage and onions and carrots [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2319.1s)]
*  and some canned tomatoes, and you got like a [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2320.8999999999996s)]
*  pretty hearty meal that's pretty nutritious [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2323.4199999999996s)]
*  for very little money. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2325.2999999999997s)]
*  And so I think there's this sort of mythology [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2326.94s)]
*  that it's expensive to eat well. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2329.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to get your $70 grass-fed rib-eye steak, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2330.98s)]
*  of course, but just to eat basic real food is not expensive. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2333.3799999999997s)]
*  And if you know how to cook, it's not expensive. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2337.98s)]
*  Grains and beans are cheap. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2340.2599999999998s)]
*  Often certain vegetables are cheap. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2342.22s)]
*  I mean, certain vegetables are not cheap, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2344.74s)]
*  but there's ways to learn how to eat well for less. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2346.18s)]
*  And then I think that whether it's the same price [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2348.5s)]
*  or maybe 50 cents more a day, most people can. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2351.7799999999997s)]
*  And in America, we spend 9% of our income on food. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2354.3799999999997s)]
*  In Europe, they spend 20% of their income on food. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2357.98s)]
*  Okay, we're at the smoothie. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2360.9399999999996s)]
*  Take us through the rest of the day, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2362.46s)]
*  and then I want to talk more broadly about, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2363.74s)]
*  so I feel like we're in a moment where, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2366.74s)]
*  depending on the week, one or another food [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2368.7799999999997s)]
*  is being demonized as evil. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2372.2999999999997s)]
*  Seed oil, sugar, blah, blah, blah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2373.54s)]
*  And I want to kind of separate myth from fact. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2375.02s)]
*  Lunch, what are you having for lunch? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2377.42s)]
*  With this today, I had- [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2378.94s)]
*  Because I got to tell you, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2379.78s)]
*  the smoothie does not sound that good to me. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2380.6s)]
*  No, but I also have eggs and avocado [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2381.74s)]
*  and tomatoes with olive oil. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2383.94s)]
*  Lunch? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2385.66s)]
*  Yeah, an omelet or whatever, vegetable omelet, frittata. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2386.5s)]
*  There's all kinds of ways to be creative for breakfast. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2388.58s)]
*  Lunch, I'll usually have a piece of protein. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2390.18s)]
*  I had salmon today for lunch with veggies. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2391.5s)]
*  That's pretty typical. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2394.58s)]
*  Occasionally, I'll have like grains or beans, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2395.82s)]
*  but they're a kind of lower part of my diet. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2397.78s)]
*  And for dinner, it's pretty much the same thing. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2400.02s)]
*  So I'll have generally fish, chicken, meat, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2401.9s)]
*  and then lots of veggies. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2404.34s)]
*  And maybe I'll have a dessert occasionally, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2405.94s)]
*  but it's not like a staple in my diet. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2409.46s)]
*  Okay, I think most people will hear that [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2411.7000000000003s)]
*  and think, Mark, it's just that- [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2413.3s)]
*  Where's the pizza? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2415.02s)]
*  Where's the pasta? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2415.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to think it's not that fun. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2416.6800000000003s)]
*  But again, when you go to Europe, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2418.98s)]
*  people, if you want to eat pasta, you can eat pasta, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2420.9s)]
*  but they serve a little plate. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2423.46s)]
*  It's like four ounces. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2425.46s)]
*  It's not Cheesecake Factory vibes. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2426.3s)]
*  It's not like 45 ounces of pasta on your plate. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2427.14s)]
*  I mean, I've been to these places in America [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2430.54s)]
*  where you go and it's like, wow, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2432.18s)]
*  that's like enough pasta for 12 people. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2433.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2436.46s)]
*  But it's really, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2437.3s)]
*  and also the quality of the pasta is different. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2438.14s)]
*  The grain is different. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2439.86s)]
*  The starch is different in it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2440.74s)]
*  If you eat grain here, it's dwarf wheat, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2442.02s)]
*  which was designed to be drought resistant [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2445.18s)]
*  and to be more hearty, and it's been incredible advanced. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2446.86s)]
*  But the downside is it's got high levels of a superstarch [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2450.08s)]
*  called amylopectin A, which acts like sugar in your body. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2454.1s)]
*  It's worse than sugar. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2456.74s)]
*  And so the wheat we're eating here [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2458.06s)]
*  is not the wheat we ate historically. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2459.78s)]
*  And in Europe, they don't have that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2461.66s)]
*  The food that I think is maybe most demonized [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2463.7s)]
*  in the culture right now, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2467.3s)]
*  I'm sure it'll change in a few weeks, is seed oils. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2468.42s)]
*  But for you, it's sugar. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2471.22s)]
*  You've talked about how sugar should be treated [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2472.62s)]
*  and stigmatized like cigarettes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2474.74s)]
*  Tell us more about why that is. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2476.22s)]
*  Why sugar is the biggest culprit? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2477.62s)]
*  Why that's the thing we should focus? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2480.02s)]
*  Those of us who are at like the baseline level, okay, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2482.06s)]
*  who don't know goat whey from Schmott whey, right? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2484.58s)]
*  I didn't know half of the ingredients in here [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2487.22s)]
*  that you're mentioning in the smoothie. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2489.2599999999998s)]
*  What are the like, for those of us just trying to get [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2491.2999999999997s)]
*  marginally more healthy, why would you argue that sugar [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2496.18s)]
*  is the, my understanding from your writing, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2500.02s)]
*  is sugar is the thing we should try and cut out first. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2502.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2504.7s)]
*  So when you look at our population, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2505.54s)]
*  50% of us have either pre-diabetes or type two diabetes [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2508.14s)]
*  by very stringent criteria. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2511.62s)]
*  75% overweight, 42% obese, 93%, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2513.9s)]
*  by the definition I'll tell in a sec, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2519.54s)]
*  are metabolically unhealthy. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2521.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2523.02s)]
*  It means you have some level of pre-diabetes [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2524.42s)]
*  along the spectrum. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2526.94s)]
*  Maybe not officially pre-diabetes, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2528.1800000000003s)]
*  but you're somewhere headed toward that direction. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2529.82s)]
*  It's a continuum disease rather than just something. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2531.78s)]
*  I think that's me. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2533.82s)]
*  Maybe, we'll find out. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2534.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to do my blood and it's going to be [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2535.5s)]
*  very scary for you. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2537.58s)]
*  And most people are not diagnosed. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2538.42s)]
*  When you get diabetes, you're diagnosed. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2541.46s)]
*  If your blood sugar is high, you get diagnosed. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2542.9s)]
*  But no doctors are looking at insulin. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2544.3s)]
*  We do this with Function Health [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2546.58s)]
*  as part of our basic screening. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2547.82s)]
*  We ask Quest, how many tests you get [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2549.58s)]
*  are this measuring insulin? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2551.34s)]
*  Less than 1%. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2552.9s)]
*  But insulin resistance is the phenomena that happens [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2554.2200000000003s)]
*  when you eat too much sugar and starch. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2556.78s)]
*  Your body just gets overloaded [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2558.3s)]
*  and the normal mechanisms to regulate your blood sugar [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2560.38s)]
*  and then insulin gets screwed up [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2562.34s)]
*  and you break your metabolism so that you become resistant [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2563.7400000000002s)]
*  to the effects of insulin and you need more and more insulin [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2566.38s)]
*  to actually keep your blood sugar under control. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2569.46s)]
*  Why is that bad? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2572.38s)]
*  Insulin is the fat storage hormone. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2573.7000000000003s)]
*  We were designed in an era, an evolutionary era, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2577.26s)]
*  where there was scarcity. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2580.26s)]
*  Where if you could find a honey from a bee. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2582.1400000000003s)]
*  Eat it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2585.9s)]
*  Eat all of it at once and store it for later. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2586.86s)]
*  If you found berries in the summer, eat them all, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2589.9s)]
*  store it for later. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2592.34s)]
*  Bears gain 500 pounds at the end of the summer [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2593.3s)]
*  by eating berries and then they go to sleep all winter. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2595.5s)]
*  We just keep eating all winter, that's the problem. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2597.6600000000003s)]
*  So we, from an evolutionary point of view, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2599.9s)]
*  we would want to have a mechanism to quickly store fat, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2601.38s)]
*  particularly belly fat around our organs. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2604.94s)]
*  So we've evolved like that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2607.62s)]
*  We had 22 teaspoons of sugar as Hunter gathered. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2609.1400000000003s)]
*  Explain more for one second. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2611.26s)]
*  You don't have any, I do. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2613.5s)]
*  Why is belly fat good? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2615.02s)]
*  Why is it good? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2616.7400000000002s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2617.58s)]
*  No, but why do we need it around our organs? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2618.42s)]
*  Because it basically was a storage form of calories [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2620.62s)]
*  when there was scarcity, historically. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2624.42s)]
*  And bears become diabetic and hypertensive [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2626.98s)]
*  at the end of the summer. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2629.46s)]
*  I imagine if we were hunters and gatherers [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2630.54s)]
*  and we found a lot of stuff at the end of the summer, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2632.38s)]
*  we'd load up for the winter and then we'd have scarcity [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2633.82s)]
*  and we'd feed off our stores. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2636.38s)]
*  But in this culture, we are just inundated, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2638.38s)]
*  not with 22 teaspoons a year, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2640.98s)]
*  but 22 teaspoons a day per person in America. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2643.7s)]
*  And kids have up to 34 teaspoons a day of sugar. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  That's a pharmacologic dose. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2650.54s)]
*  Our biology has nothing to do with that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2651.82s)]
*  And so we just keep storing and storing and storing. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2653.42s)]
*  And that's why you see people have this metabolic crisis. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2656.3s)]
*  How do we create a cultural stigma around sugar? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2658.94s)]
*  It's a new secret, I agree. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2662.7400000000002s)]
*  I think we need to have the NIH [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2663.82s)]
*  and the, because nobody's going to study this [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2667.58s)]
*  because there's no money in the result, right? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2670.82s)]
*  So the federal government has to actually do the research [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2673.42s)]
*  on this and show how it affects us, why it's a problem, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2676.1s)]
*  and why it's causing chronic disease. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2679.14s)]
*  And they won't change until they do the studies, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2681.26s)]
*  but there's plenty of data out there that shows this. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2683.94s)]
*  This is not my opinion. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2685.9s)]
*  We understand that people eating ultra-processed food [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2688.14s)]
*  have over 32 different health conditions [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2691.3399999999997s)]
*  that are connected to it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2693.94s)]
*  And we need to shift our understanding from a culture [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2696.02s)]
*  that is sort of focused on convenience and ease [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2699.1s)]
*  to one that understands that we need to actually [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2703.94s)]
*  take care of our biology if we want to be healthy, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2705.66s)]
*  and we have to dramatically cut down sugar and starch. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2707.1s)]
*  Let me get rid of it. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2709.2999999999997s)]
*  And if you're active, if you're fit, you can eat more of it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2710.42s)]
*  If you're a marathon runner, yeah, you can eat more. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2712.66s)]
*  But Peter Atiyah actually was an elite athlete, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2714.78s)]
*  and he was swimming Catalina Island from Los Angeles. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2719.26s)]
*  And he was still overweight. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2722.9s)]
*  And he had metabolic syndrome. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2723.7400000000002s)]
*  He had pre-diabetes because he was eating all the sugars [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2725.94s)]
*  and the goose that you fueled when you were an athlete, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2727.98s)]
*  but that's not a good idea. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2730.02s)]
*  So if you are an athlete in the ideal Mark Hyman [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2731.78s)]
*  vision of the world, are you like... [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2734.38s)]
*  Carb loading? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2737.1000000000004s)]
*  No, are you just grabbing a pile of broccoli [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2737.98s)]
*  from your pocket and shoving it in your mouth? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2741.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, fat actually is a great fuel for energy. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2743.86s)]
*  It's a much more lasting fuel. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2746.42s)]
*  I mean, you have 2,500 calories of glycogen in your muscles, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2747.78s)]
*  which is a storage form of carbs, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2751.02s)]
*  but you might have 50 to 100,000 calories of fat [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2752.94s)]
*  on your body that you can, if you learn how to activate that, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2755.7000000000003s)]
*  you can burn that. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2757.94s)]
*  Okay, one of the things that I never heard phrases [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2759.6200000000003s)]
*  growing up at all was gut health. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, or this whole idea of the gut. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2765.82s)]
*  The gut was just like your fat, you have a gut, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2767.7400000000002s)]
*  you have a beer gut. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2769.78s)]
*  Not the idea that this is... [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2770.98s)]
*  Microbiome. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2772.42s)]
*  Like a microbiome. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2773.42s)]
*  I mean, there's all these words that I've learned recently, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2774.82s)]
*  I feel like, it's like a new vocabulary. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2777.86s)]
*  Give me the riff on the gut and why that's become a buzzword, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2781.06s)]
*  why that maybe has been something that's been overlooked [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2789.18s)]
*  and why you think gut health, what it is [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2792.14s)]
*  and why you think it's so important and significant. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2795.22s)]
*  Yeah, really important. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2797.5s)]
*  I mean, even the word shit. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2798.34s)]
*  That's like a bad thing, right? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2799.8199999999997s)]
*  You mean taking a shit? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2802.62s)]
*  No, just like if you want to say something bad, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2803.58s)]
*  you say that shit, all right? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2805.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2805.98s)]
*  It's like, in fact, we've dismissed the whole microbiome, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2806.8199999999997s)]
*  the poop as this waste product that has no role [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2810.7s)]
*  in the human body, that doesn't do anything [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2813.2599999999998s)]
*  and basically just your waste products. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2815.1s)]
*  Nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2817.2999999999997s)]
*  You're way outnumbered by the bugs in your gut. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2819.98s)]
*  You have probably 100 times as much bacterial DNA [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2823.2599999999998s)]
*  as your own DNA. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2825.8199999999997s)]
*  If you did a blood test, probably a third to half [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2826.98s)]
*  of all the metabolites in your blood [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2829.74s)]
*  come from the bugs in your gut and the proteins they produce [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2830.74s)]
*  that affect every aspect of your health. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2833.8599999999997s)]
*  And now we're understanding, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2836.06s)]
*  and this is core to functional medicine. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2837.2999999999997s)]
*  I used to call me Dr. See Every Poop [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2839.66s)]
*  because I love to do stool tests. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2842.22s)]
*  You do? Of course. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2844.22s)]
*  It's like you learn so much by looking at someone's gut [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2845.62s)]
*  and how their gut's functioning, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2848.4199999999996s)]
*  whether bugs are in there, whether there's inflammation, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2850.06s)]
*  whether they're producing the right metabolites, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2852.2599999999998s)]
*  whether there's things that shouldn't be growing in there [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2854.98s)]
*  and you can basically create health [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2856.78s)]
*  by optimizing someone's gut. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2859.1000000000004s)]
*  And we're learning it's linked to everything [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2860.42s)]
*  from autism to Alzheimer's, from cancer to diabetes, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2862.7400000000002s)]
*  autoimmune disease to allergies. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2867.6200000000003s)]
*  You name a disease, it's probably linked to the microbiome. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2869.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's sort of this black box that we poorly understand. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2873.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's sort of the era of research on the microbiome. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2876.38s)]
*  And you don't need to fully understand it all [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2879.7000000000003s)]
*  in order to heal it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2883.02s)]
*  So even though I don't understand all the minutiae [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2884.5800000000004s)]
*  of everything that's happening in there, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2886.42s)]
*  and I probably couldn't if I said it my whole life, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2887.38s)]
*  I was able to help this woman with psoriatic arthritis [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2889.62s)]
*  who had a gut issue. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2891.7000000000003s)]
*  And 60% of your immune system is in your gut. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2893.3s)]
*  And when you have damaged your gut lining, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2896.9s)]
*  which many of us do, it's called a leaky gut, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2898.98s)]
*  which I used to be laughed at talking about. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2901.54s)]
*  Now it's sort of all over the medical literature. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2903.3s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2905.26s)]
*  It means that the lining, which is a cell thick, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2906.46s)]
*  if you lay it out flat, it's the size of a tennis court. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2909.58s)]
*  It's connected by these things called tight junctions, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2911.82s)]
*  which are like Lego connections [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2914.42s)]
*  that put the cells together. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2916.86s)]
*  It's one cell between you and a sewer. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2917.7s)]
*  When those cells start to come apart, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2919.1s)]
*  and there's a lot of reasons for that, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2920.7799999999997s)]
*  gluten, stress, toxins, changes in the microbiome, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2921.9s)]
*  it creates this interruption, this barrier. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2926.2999999999997s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, the sewer that's on one side [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2928.74s)]
*  starts to leak in and your immune system [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2930.46s)]
*  is right under there. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2932.18s)]
*  And you start creating an inflammatory response. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2933.22s)]
*  And so almost all the chronic diseases we see [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2934.98s)]
*  are inflammatory diseases, heart disease, diabetes, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2937.2999999999997s)]
*  cancer, dementia, obviously autoimmune diseases, allergies, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2939.86s)]
*  all those are inflammatory diseases. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2942.86s)]
*  And we're seeing with Function Health, with the panel we do, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2944.78s)]
*  46% of Americans have high levels [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2947.42s)]
*  of a biomarker of inflammation called CRP. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2949.86s)]
*  That's crazy to me. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2953.1800000000003s)]
*  33% have an autoimmunating body. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2955.1000000000004s)]
*  Where's it coming from? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2958.2200000000003s)]
*  Where's the inflammation coming from? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2959.6200000000003s)]
*  Why is our gut so messed up? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2961.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes, and where is the inflammation? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2962.46s)]
*  It's not hard to understand. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2963.6200000000003s)]
*  So one, C-section mates have gone through the roof. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2964.7400000000002s)]
*  So one in three births for C-section, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2968.5400000000004s)]
*  and you don't go through the vaginal canal. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2970.1000000000004s)]
*  You don't inoculate your microbiome and your gut. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2971.38s)]
*  Two, the mother's taking antibiotics. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2974.06s)]
*  So they're killing off very important species [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  that the mother has that she's supposed to give to her baby [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2977.62s)]
*  that protect the immune system of the gut. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2979.46s)]
*  Three, we're seeing lack of breastfeeding, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2981.42s)]
*  which again, 25% of the calories in breast milk, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2983.62s)]
*  this is crazy from an evolutionary point of view, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2987.2999999999997s)]
*  25% of the calories are non-digestible by the baby. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2989.18s)]
*  They're meant to feed the bugs in the gut. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2992.14s)]
*  But the other fun fact about the breast milk [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2995.18s)]
*  is it's 25% saturated fat. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=2998.18s)]
*  So saturated fat was so bad, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3001.06s)]
*  why did God or whoever you believe created us [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3002.66s)]
*  or didn't create us, why is it in there? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3004.62s)]
*  God. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3006.7s)]
*  Yeah, God. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3007.62s)]
*  I was at that debate in Austin. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3009.1s)]
*  Oh God, that was good. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3010.94s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad you were here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3012.06s)]
*  So then we have antibiotics that destroy our microbiome, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3013.2999999999997s)]
*  which were given out like candy for decades. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3018.06s)]
*  Then we have an industrial food system [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3020.3799999999997s)]
*  that has ingredients in it that destroy the gut, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3022.14s)]
*  like all the emulsifiers in processed food [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3024.18s)]
*  that make food have a nice texture, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3026.62s)]
*  those all destroy the gut lining and increase inflammation. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3028.94s)]
*  Then we feed the bad bugs by feeding them sugar [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3032.1s)]
*  and we don't feed the good bugs by feeding them fiber [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3034.94s)]
*  and the right things that they need to eat. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3037.22s)]
*  And so we have this sort of kind of catastrophic [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3038.94s)]
*  accumulation of events throughout the last 60 years [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3044.18s)]
*  that have created a massive problem [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3047.18s)]
*  with our microbiome and our gut. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3048.82s)]
*  It's partly responsible for all the things we're seeing. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3050.3s)]
*  Let me give you the like non-expert experience that I have. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3053.22s)]
*  I'm basically a guinea pig for you [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3059.14s)]
*  because I eat all the bad stuff that you think I shouldn't eat. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3060.54s)]
*  And as I listen to you, we're going to have a talk after. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3063.3s)]
*  Lots of people have tried to intervene. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3066.02s)]
*  I know it's bad and this is where I'm going with it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3067.42s)]
*  I feel bad when I eat the bad things. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3070.5s)]
*  And anyone that's had a Big Mac lately, it's delicious, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3073.14s)]
*  but you feel bad afterward. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3077.5s)]
*  You feel low energy for sure. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3080.1s)]
*  You get FLC syndrome, know what that is? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3083.38s)]
*  Let me guess, FLC. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3085.98s)]
*  Feel like crap. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3088.34s)]
*  Feel like crap. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3089.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, feel like crap, exactly. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3090.1s)]
*  You feel like crap. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3092.3399999999997s)]
*  And for me, that's enough to know [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3093.66s)]
*  that you're broadly onto something. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3095.46s)]
*  I don't need to know the names [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3097.98s)]
*  of all of the different elements here [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3099.5s)]
*  to know that when I eat healthy, I feel sharper, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3101.8199999999997s)]
*  I feel more energized, I sleep better, et cetera. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3104.8999999999996s)]
*  And when I eat badly, I know that it doesn't work. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3107.7s)]
*  I have FLC. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3110.74s)]
*  The problem is that, I think what you're discounting [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3111.62s)]
*  in this conversation a little bit is the pleasure [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3115.5s)]
*  and the comfort and the fun of eating the foods [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3118.26s)]
*  that you have so cut out of your life. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3122.2200000000003s)]
*  How do you convince people to? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  I love to eat and I eat whatever I want. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3127.5800000000004s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3129.5400000000004s)]
*  You don't eat whatever you want. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3130.38s)]
*  I eat food. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3131.34s)]
*  I don't eat things that are not food. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3132.1800000000003s)]
*  Pizza. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3133.78s)]
*  Pizza is food, but it depends how the pizza's made [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3134.6200000000003s)]
*  and if it's full of all kinds of crap [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3136.78s)]
*  which you can get when you buy industrially made pizza. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3138.38s)]
*  If it's a nice pizza that's made in a great restaurant [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3140.78s)]
*  or that I make myself, I'll eat it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3143.5400000000004s)]
*  So you will indulge. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3146.5s)]
*  Of course, if it's ice cream, occasionally I'll eat it. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3147.38s)]
*  If it's sugar, I'll eat it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3150.1s)]
*  It's the volume that matters. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3151.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's what else you're eating [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3153.38s)]
*  in conjunction with it that matters. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3154.86s)]
*  You won't see me drinking a Coca-Cola. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3156.6600000000003s)]
*  You won't see me eating Pop-Tarts. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3159.38s)]
*  You won't see me eating stuff [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3161.54s)]
*  because that technically isn't food. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3162.58s)]
*  To me, it looks like a rock. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3164.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3165.38s)]
*  Because what you have to understand, Barry, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3166.2200000000003s)]
*  is these foods were designed by food industry [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3167.6600000000003s)]
*  to be highly addictive. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3172.2200000000003s)]
*  In fact, tobacco companies bought up, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3173.42s)]
*  when the tobacco industry was going down, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3175.46s)]
*  they bought up a lot of the food industry, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3177.5s)]
*  like Philip Morris Kraft, RGR Nabisco, back in the 70s, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3178.34s)]
*  and they put their scientists on [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3181.7000000000003s)]
*  creating addictive compounds in food. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3183.18s)]
*  And they create, Michael Moss. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3184.66s)]
*  They're geniuses. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3185.98s)]
*  And Michael Moss wrote a book about this [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3186.82s)]
*  called Solid Sugar and Fatty, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3188.06s)]
*  and he interviewed 300 different food industry executives [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3189.06s)]
*  and scientists and whistleblowers. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3190.9s)]
*  And he showed that they have taste institutes, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3193.18s)]
*  they hire craving experts. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3195.18s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3196.38s)]
*  To create the bliss point of food, to create heavy users. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3197.2200000000003s)]
*  These are their internal terms they use. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3198.94s)]
*  And they actually put little two-year-olds in MRI scanners [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3201.38s)]
*  to look at their brains and what's going to be lit up [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3204.26s)]
*  by different images. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3205.66s)]
*  They actually understand this. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3207.86s)]
*  And if you look at the Yale Food Addiction Scale, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3208.7000000000003s)]
*  which is a scientifically-validated scale for addiction, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3211.82s)]
*  this is not people who are just like, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3214.38s)]
*  oh yeah, I'm a little, I crave this or that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3215.7000000000003s)]
*  These are people who really have trouble. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3217.26s)]
*  It's 14% of the population of the world, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3219.3s)]
*  including 14% of kids. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3222.26s)]
*  Now, 14% of kids are not alcoholic, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3224.02s)]
*  but 14% of adults are. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3225.82s)]
*  So it's the same level of addiction we see [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3227.38s)]
*  in terms of alcoholism. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3230.06s)]
*  It's highly addictive, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3231.54s)]
*  and it affects the pleasure center in the brain, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3232.6600000000003s)]
*  and it makes you coming back for more and more. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3235.42s)]
*  And certain people genetically have dopamine issues. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3238.06s)]
*  They have genetics where they need more [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3241.06s)]
*  dopamine stimulation to feel good. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3243.06s)]
*  These are the thrill seekers, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3244.66s)]
*  or the incredible food addicts, right? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3246.26s)]
*  Guys who like jump off a giant cliff and a ski run. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3248.06s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not going down that. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3251.7400000000002s)]
*  They're like, come on, let's go. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3253.14s)]
*  I'm like, nope. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3253.98s)]
*  So I think there are people who need more, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3254.94s)]
*  but the food addiction thing is a real problem. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3257.94s)]
*  And so people have to understand that they need [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3260.5s)]
*  to take back their body from the body snatchers. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3263.42s)]
*  What would you recommend to someone listening to this, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3266.6600000000003s)]
*  thinking to themselves, I know he's right. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3269.3s)]
*  I know he's right. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3271.86s)]
*  Okay, I know what he's saying is commonsensical. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3273.02s)]
*  I know that I feel better when I eat those foods, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3275.98s)]
*  but I find it so hard to break my old habits. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3278.62s)]
*  What's a place where they can start? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3280.9s)]
*  It's very hard. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3282.58s)]
*  So, you know, it's easy. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3283.42s)]
*  So I've been doing this for a long, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3285.7400000000002s)]
*  I've been doing this in my practice, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3287.1400000000003s)]
*  and I basically created a way of eating [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3288.5s)]
*  that breaks the food addiction cycle. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3290.3s)]
*  And I wrote a book about it called The 10 Day Detox Diet. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3292.06s)]
*  And I created an online program called 10 Day Detox. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3294.98s)]
*  Go to 10daydetox.com. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3298.02s)]
*  And in 10 days, I mean, I could have called it [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3299.2599999999998s)]
*  the 10 Month Detox, nobody would have done it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3300.9s)]
*  But if I call it the 10 Day Detox, people will try it. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3302.3s)]
*  And you don't have to believe me. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3305.2599999999998s)]
*  What is it? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3306.82s)]
*  You don't have to listen to me. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3307.66s)]
*  You just have to eat this way for 10 days [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3308.5s)]
*  and follow the instructions about what to eat, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3310.14s)]
*  when and how to eat. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3311.62s)]
*  And what happens when people do that [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3313.14s)]
*  is there's a 70% reduction in all symptoms from all diseases. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3314.86s)]
*  There's an average weight loss of eight pounds. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3319.3s)]
*  Blood pressure drops. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3321.42s)]
*  In 10 days? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3322.26s)]
*  In 10 days. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3323.1000000000004s)]
*  Blood pressure, yeah, because what you're doing [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3323.94s)]
*  is you're shutting off insulin production dramatically. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3325.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the sugar, you're cutting out the sugar. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3329.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so you lose a lot of water weight. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3330.6200000000003s)]
*  So what people don't realize is that [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3332.0600000000004s)]
*  we have a hypertension problem in this country. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3333.86s)]
*  It's caused by insulin resistance. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3335.38s)]
*  And what happens is when you eat sugar, you raise insulin. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3337.7400000000002s)]
*  When you raise insulin, you retain sodium. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3342.02s)]
*  When you retain sodium, retain water. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3343.86s)]
*  So as soon as you drop the insulin, you drop the water, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3346.02s)]
*  you drop the inflammation. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3347.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's an anti-inflammatory whole foods diet. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3348.6200000000003s)]
*  So it's protein, it's veggies, it's nuts and seeds. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3350.38s)]
*  It's what you eat. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3353.42s)]
*  It's berries, it's basically what I eat most of the time. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3354.26s)]
*  And I'll indulge once in a while [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3356.5s)]
*  because I've tuned up my metabolism. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3358.2200000000003s)]
*  But if your metabolism's broken, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3360.42s)]
*  like if you're a diabetic, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3362.1s)]
*  I'm trying to drink a can of Coke, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3363.06s)]
*  it's not going to materially affect me. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3364.06s)]
*  If I give a diabetic a can of Coke, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3365.1800000000003s)]
*  their sugar will go up to 300, right? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3367.06s)]
*  And so it's because their metabolism's broken. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3369.3s)]
*  But for most people, having a way to sort of break the cycle, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3371.02s)]
*  to understand that they actually can actually own [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3374.46s)]
*  their biology is very empowering. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3377.9s)]
*  I mean, I remember doing a workshop on this [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3381.1000000000004s)]
*  and there was a woman who came to me, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3382.5s)]
*  Dr. Hyman, I want to do this. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3383.34s)]
*  I came here for a week, I paid for this workshop. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3384.78s)]
*  But I tell you, I'm a sugar addict. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3387.0600000000004s)]
*  There's no way I've never been able to get off it. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3388.5400000000004s)]
*  I can't stop it. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3390.3s)]
*  I said, just don't worry. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3391.1400000000003s)]
*  Just eat, do exactly what you want. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3391.98s)]
*  Just follow the program. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3393.1400000000003s)]
*  Say how you do. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3394.1400000000003s)]
*  Two days later, she says, Dr. Hyman, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3394.98s)]
*  I don't understand what happened. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3395.82s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't have any cravings anymore. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3396.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't want this stuff anymore. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3399.38s)]
*  I don't care about it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3400.5s)]
*  And so it's not that you're a bad person [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3402.3s)]
*  or have a moral failing or it's your fault, you're overweight. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3404.78s)]
*  This is the myth that the food industry wants us to believe. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3408.1s)]
*  It's all about personal responsibility. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3410.8199999999997s)]
*  It's all because you don't exercise enough [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3413.02s)]
*  and you eat too much. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3415.06s)]
*  Eat less and exercise more. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3416.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the solution. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3417.74s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3419.02s)]
*  I mean, exercise has barely come up. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3420.06s)]
*  I mean, that is something that I think [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3421.94s)]
*  has been revelatory for me, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3424.38s)]
*  is the understanding that, yeah, exercise is important. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3426.54s)]
*  Being sedentary is not great. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3429.7s)]
*  But it really is what you eat. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3431.5s)]
*  You cannot exercise your way out of a bad diet. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3433.74s)]
*  You just can't. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3435.62s)]
*  Exercise is critically important [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3437.22s)]
*  and will kind of accelerate your benefit and results [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3438.8199999999997s)]
*  and has all these downstream consequences. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3440.8599999999997s)]
*  It's the best drug ever invented, period. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3442.46s)]
*  But if you just fill your body [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3445.02s)]
*  with all the wrong stuff and the fuel, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3446.8199999999997s)]
*  you're not going to win. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3448.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3450.54s)]
*  Before we move on, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3452.1s)]
*  in this 10-day detox, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3453.7s)]
*  I'm assuming alcohol is not on the menu. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3454.74s)]
*  Not on the menu. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3456.4199999999996s)]
*  How should we think about alcohol? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3457.58s)]
*  Don't drink your liquid sugar to calc. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3459.06s)]
*  Alcohol, you know, occasional drink once in a while, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3460.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's going to harm anybody. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3464.98s)]
*  And there are populations, like in the Blue Zones, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3466.26s)]
*  where I visited them. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3468.42s)]
*  I went to a book called Young Forever [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3469.5400000000004s)]
*  and there were lots of people drinking wine every day. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3470.6200000000003s)]
*  It was made differently. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3474.26s)]
*  It was local. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3475.26s)]
*  It didn't have all kinds of weird stuff in it. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3476.1000000000004s)]
*  And they also did everything else right. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3478.1000000000004s)]
*  So what do you do in your life? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3480.34s)]
*  I've really gone to a place where I don't drink that much. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3481.98s)]
*  Occasionally, once a month, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3484.46s)]
*  I might have a shot of tequila or a glass of wine. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3485.7400000000002s)]
*  But I know I don't feel good afterwards. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3487.7400000000002s)]
*  And I notice more of the effects, right? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3489.5s)]
*  I feel like it's becoming chic not to drink. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3491.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3495.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, I had a dinner party the other night at my house [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3497.02s)]
*  and like, there were like 12 people. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3498.98s)]
*  Everyone's like having club soda. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3499.8199999999997s)]
*  And nobody's drinking. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3500.66s)]
*  I'm like, wow, okay. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3501.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3503.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty amazing. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3504.22s)]
*  And I think, you know, the data is a little mixed. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3505.18s)]
*  You know, there is some increase in cancer risk. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3508.2999999999997s)]
*  I think the Surgeon General came out with a report saying, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3510.4199999999996s)]
*  you know, it's sort of an unnecessary risk we take, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3512.2599999999998s)]
*  but we should be aware of it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3515.7s)]
*  And it does increase the risk of certain cancers. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3516.7s)]
*  But I don't really think of that as the boogeyman. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3519.2999999999997s)]
*  The real boogeyman out there, Barry, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3521.8199999999997s)]
*  is liquid sugar calories. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3523.18s)]
*  Coca-Cola. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3525.9s)]
*  Juices, sodas, sports drinks, energy drinks. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3526.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, you name it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3531.06s)]
*  That is a market that is thriving right now. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3532.5s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that there was a, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3535.78s)]
*  there's like an organic kind of Gen Z soda brand. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3537.9s)]
*  I think it's called Poppy. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3543.14s)]
*  It just got bought by Coca-Cola or Pepsi [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3544.1s)]
*  for like billions of dollars. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3546.1s)]
*  Why do we like these drinks so much? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3548.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, a lot of them actually, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3550.5s)]
*  the newer ones have lower sugar. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3551.6600000000003s)]
*  They have. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3553.46s)]
*  But they still have sugar. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3554.3s)]
*  Stevia. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3555.14s)]
*  They might have some. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3556.22s)]
*  Some do, some don't. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3557.06s)]
*  So there's a lot more sort of low calorie [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3557.9s)]
*  or no calorie sugary drinks, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3559.2999999999997s)]
*  which basically are sweetened with I think aspartame, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3562.2999999999997s)]
*  to stevia, to monk fruit, to who knows what. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3564.7s)]
*  And those are probably better for you, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3567.62s)]
*  but at the end of the day, you know, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3569.94s)]
*  these are highly addictive things [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3574.02s)]
*  that we should be not consuming on a regular basis. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3575.54s)]
*  If you want to have once in a while have a treat, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3577.5s)]
*  that's fine. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3579.46s)]
*  I'm not like a fanatic. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3580.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, you can be flexible. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3581.7s)]
*  But if you're more healthy, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3583.62s)]
*  if you're more metabolically flexible, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3585.46s)]
*  you have more degrees of freedom. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3587.2999999999997s)]
*  If I eat a half a pint of ice cream [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3588.94s)]
*  like I did the other night, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3590.38s)]
*  I'm not a big deal, right? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3592.1s)]
*  Do you feel good afterwards? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3593.54s)]
*  I, you know, probably didn't, but it was okay. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3594.5s)]
*  But it was worth it. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3597.2599999999998s)]
*  It was worth it. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3598.1s)]
*  My wife was always skiing and I was like, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3598.94s)]
*  oh, I'm sitting at home. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3600.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm just by myself. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3601.1s)]
*  What flavor? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3601.94s)]
*  It was mid chocolate chip. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3602.7799999999997s)]
*  What brand? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3603.98s)]
*  It was a brand called Jenny's, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3606.22s)]
*  which happened to be in the fridge. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3607.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't really buy it. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3608.7s)]
*  You might realize I don't buy it. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3609.54s)]
*  Now my wife tends to order it and get it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3610.94s)]
*  I don't like to have it in the house [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3612.94s)]
*  because I'm like anybody else. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3614.7400000000002s)]
*  If there's cookies or if there's ice cream [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3615.78s)]
*  and I'm having a bad moment, guess what? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3618.3s)]
*  I'm going to go to the fridge and I'm going to get it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3620.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3621.7400000000002s)]
*  So I set up my home to be a safe zone. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3622.5800000000004s)]
*  What can we replace that comfort with? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3625.1000000000004s)]
*  Because I am that person. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3628.38s)]
*  Like I, I mean, it was like a joke. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3629.86s)]
*  Like at former workplaces, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3632.6600000000003s)]
*  when I would like meet a deadline or get a great scoop, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3634.42s)]
*  I'm like going to McDonald's. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3636.6200000000003s)]
*  Like I would reward my- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3637.86s)]
*  Got a scoop, get a scoop. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3638.94s)]
*  It's just, yes. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3639.98s)]
*  But french fries. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3641.42s)]
*  Like that was always my thing. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3642.9s)]
*  I know it's really, really bad. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3645.1800000000003s)]
*  But like what do you replace that with? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3646.86s)]
*  I think there's a lot of fun stuff out there [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3650.06s)]
*  you can replace it with. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3651.9s)]
*  There's sort of swaps that you can make and you can learn. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3652.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, they can make some, for example, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3654.82s)]
*  I make, I have a blender at home and there's some blenders, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3656.46s)]
*  but I put in coconut milk and I put in frozen berries. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3659.82s)]
*  You can put a frozen banana in there, blend it up. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3662.62s)]
*  And if you want, you can put a little maple syrup [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3665.02s)]
*  or honey in and it's like ice cream, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3667.06s)]
*  except it's not ice cream. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3668.86s)]
*  It's not as good. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3670.34s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3671.34s)]
*  It's approximating. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3672.1800000000003s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3673.02s)]
*  It's pretty, pretty good. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3673.86s)]
*  One of the things Mark that you've written [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3674.7000000000003s)]
*  and talked a lot of- [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3676.1000000000004s)]
*  My friend Larry David would say. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3676.94s)]
*  It's pretty, pretty good. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3677.78s)]
*  One of the things that you have written about [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3679.54s)]
*  and talked about is that it's not just the food [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3682.54s)]
*  in our grocery store and the food in our homes, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3685.46s)]
*  the food on our plates, it's where and how it was grown. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3687.5s)]
*  And I think broadly speaking, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3691.1000000000004s)]
*  many people would agree directionally [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3693.94s)]
*  with what you're saying, but they will make the argument, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3697.1400000000003s)]
*  and I think a pretty sound argument, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3699.66s)]
*  that time's arrow does not move backward. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3701.2599999999998s)]
*  We're not going to go back to a time [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3704.3799999999997s)]
*  of family subsistence farming, nor would we want to. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3706.14s)]
*  Because frankly, these are technological innovations [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3709.62s)]
*  that have liberated us. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3713.14s)]
*  Where's the right balance between those two things? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3714.58s)]
*  Well, with all my weird background, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3717.8599999999997s)]
*  I also studied agriculture back in the day. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3720.2999999999997s)]
*  Of course you did. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3724.42s)]
*  And I've got very in-amber with Wendell Berry [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  and I wanted to be an organic farmer [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3728.18s)]
*  and he came to Cornell and gave a talk [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3729.6600000000003s)]
*  and I told him my dream and he's like, don't do it, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3731.38s)]
*  it's a horrible life. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3733.5s)]
*  I'm like, oh God, what am I going to do now? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3734.34s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3736.78s)]
*  Why do you say it was a horrible life? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3737.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, it was just tough. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3738.46s)]
*  It's just tough being a farmer. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3739.3s)]
*  And I think we obviously can't go backwards, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3740.1400000000003s)]
*  but we can actually support a shift [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3743.26s)]
*  toward a more regenerative system. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3746.26s)]
*  So just to back up a little bit for people to understand, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3747.6600000000003s)]
*  the industrialization of agriculture [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3750.1000000000004s)]
*  led to massive tilling of the soil. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3751.5800000000004s)]
*  That's sort of what led to the dust bowl too, by the way. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3755.3s)]
*  And the soil organic matter has dropped over 50%. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3758.86s)]
*  We used to have eight to 50 feet of topsoil in the Midwest, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3762.6600000000003s)]
*  which is basically where we had all this agricultural boom. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3764.94s)]
*  We're basically winning it away. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3767.78s)]
*  It just blows away in the dust [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3769.38s)]
*  and we're losing the organic matter. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3770.6600000000003s)]
*  We're also killing it by putting antibiotics on the soil, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3772.6200000000003s)]
*  which was glyphosate and the herbicides [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3775.06s)]
*  and the pesticides, the fertilizer. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3777.7400000000002s)]
*  So we're basically killing the soil organic matter, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3779.54s)]
*  which has the life in it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3781.5s)]
*  And that life is what allows the plant [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3782.38s)]
*  to extract nutrients from the soil. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3785.82s)]
*  So if you look at the actual broccoli we're eating today, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3788.18s)]
*  it's probably 50% less nutritious than it was 50 years ago. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3790.4199999999996s)]
*  And there is a way to scale up regenerative agriculture [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3793.98s)]
*  that actually supports large scale farming [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3797.54s)]
*  in a different way. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3799.6s)]
*  And it's using other techniques. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3800.54s)]
*  Gabe Brown in North Dakota did this on 5,000 acres. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3802.58s)]
*  His farm was destroyed by hail, by drought, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3805.74s)]
*  by all kinds of things. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3807.7799999999997s)]
*  And he's like, this is crazy, I'm going to go out of business. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3808.6s)]
*  And he started reading Thomas Jefferson's journals. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3810.58s)]
*  Wow, that's amazing. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3812.98s)]
*  And he got inspired on different agricultural techniques [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3814.22s)]
*  that they used back then to preserve the soil. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3816.74s)]
*  And when we farm the way we do, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3819.06s)]
*  not only do we destroy the soil, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3820.62s)]
*  but we deplete our global water sources, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3821.74s)]
*  our aquifers are draining faster than we can replenish them. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3823.8599999999997s)]
*  We're putting on nitrogen fertilizer in massive amounts, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3826.66s)]
*  besides it causing nitrous oxide that causes climate change, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3829.9799999999996s)]
*  besides the fact that it uses 2% of the world's energy [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3833.7799999999997s)]
*  supplies to actually make the fertilizer. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3836.9399999999996s)]
*  We actually put it on the soil and it drains into the rivers [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3839.74s)]
*  and the water supply and creates eutrophication, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3842.8199999999997s)]
*  which drains all the life out of those water supplies. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3845.62s)]
*  So in the Gulf of Mexico, I don't know what you call it now, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3848.3399999999997s)]
*  but whatever it is. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3850.22s)]
*  Gulf of America, Mark, please. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3851.06s)]
*  Gulf of America. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3852.74s)]
*  There's a dead zone the size of New Jersey that is huge. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3853.58s)]
*  And there's 400 of those around the world [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3859.06s)]
*  that feed half a billion people. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3860.42s)]
*  So that's what we're killing. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3862.2999999999997s)]
*  So we're losing all the fish life. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3863.66s)]
*  And then we're killing biodiversity. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3865.2599999999998s)]
*  So we've lost half of our bird species, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3867.66s)]
*  we've lost 75% of our pollinator species. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3869.18s)]
*  So if we continue this way, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3871.74s)]
*  we're not going to be able to grow food. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3873.02s)]
*  Soil left in 60 harvests according to the UN. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3874.5s)]
*  Obama's report on the soil said it was 80 harvests. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3878.1s)]
*  I mean, whatever it's 60, 80, it's not that much more time. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3880.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe with all my longevity stuff, I'll still be alive. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3883.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3885.7799999999997s)]
*  We'll see, you probably will be. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3887.1s)]
*  And not if you keep eating McDonald's. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3888.94s)]
*  And so we basically have a system that's a- [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3891.3399999999997s)]
*  Trump is basically the counter argument [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3895.06s)]
*  to everything we've been talking about. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3896.66s)]
*  I think it's the preservatives. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3897.98s)]
*  I think it just preserved very well. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3900.2599999999998s)]
*  We can't continue this way, even if we wanted to, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3904.6600000000003s)]
*  and have a agriculture that's going to feed the population. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3907.46s)]
*  So we have to reimagine agriculture. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3910.1800000000003s)]
*  And I've written a lot about this, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3912.42s)]
*  but I think it's very much what I do with medicine. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3913.5s)]
*  I do medicine that actually restores health. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3916.7000000000003s)]
*  The science of creating health [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3919.3s)]
*  is what I think of when I think of functional medicine. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3920.38s)]
*  So how do we create a healthy ecosystem on a farm [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3922.7400000000002s)]
*  that's thriving, that creates more food, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3924.9s)]
*  that makes more money for farmers, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3927.5800000000004s)]
*  that restores the soil, that increases biodiversity, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3929.2200000000003s)]
*  that preserves our water supply, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3931.5s)]
*  that doesn't cause eutrophication [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3933.02s)]
*  of the waterways in the world? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3935.42s)]
*  This is all possible, and it's been well worked out [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3937.86s)]
*  and well demonstrated. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3940.34s)]
*  There's two films that are going to be released, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3941.18s)]
*  I think on Earth Day, I don't know if this podcast [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3942.66s)]
*  comes out, but Kiss to Ground and Common Ground, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3944.86s)]
*  they're going to be on, I think, on Amazon or Netflix. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3946.86s)]
*  But to tell the story of how to do this at scale. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3949.18s)]
*  You know what's way easier [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3951.78s)]
*  than solving regenerative agriculture? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3952.98s)]
*  Ozempic. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3955.58s)]
*  And giving it to lots of people, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3956.7s)]
*  which is what's happening right now. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3959.42s)]
*  It's just incredible how many people are on this drug. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3961.8599999999997s)]
*  What do you think about the boom in these GLPs ones, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3966.5s)]
*  and where do you think we're going with it? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3969.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it's a tool, like any other tool in medicine, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3971.1s)]
*  it has to be used appropriately in the right patient [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3973.14s)]
*  for the right reason at the right time, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3975.3399999999997s)]
*  for the right amount of time, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3976.7s)]
*  with the right wraparound services. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3978.02s)]
*  So I don't think anybody should be prescribed these drugs [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3979.58s)]
*  unless they are mandated, essentially, or agreed to, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3983.1s)]
*  eating at least a gram of protein [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3987.8999999999996s)]
*  per pound of ideal body weight, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3989.7799999999997s)]
*  and strength training at least three times a week [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3991.4599999999996s)]
*  for 20 to 30 minutes. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3993.54s)]
*  Because you lose muscle, and if you lose muscle, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3995.3799999999997s)]
*  that's where your metabolism is. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=3999.02s)]
*  It's seven times more metabolically active than fat, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4000.58s)]
*  so you burn seven times more calories. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4003.1s)]
*  When you lose weight on Ozempic, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4004.74s)]
*  or any of these GLP-1 agonists, or combination drugs, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4006.3399999999997s)]
*  you lose muscle and fat. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4009.66s)]
*  And you lose more muscle than usual, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4011.5s)]
*  and then when you stop, you gain back the weight, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4014.1s)]
*  65% of it's gained back or more, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4016.62s)]
*  but you gain back as fat. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4019.18s)]
*  So you can be the same weight you were [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4020.58s)]
*  when you started the drug at the end of getting off it, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4022.22s)]
*  and actually have a slower metabolism, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4025.3799999999997s)]
*  and you need less calories, which is a bad place to be. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4027.5s)]
*  So I think these drugs have a place. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4031.1s)]
*  I think there's billions of dollars being spent [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4033.22s)]
*  to show how they're effective for everything, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4036.66s)]
*  from autoimmune disease, to depression, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4038.66s)]
*  to Alzheimer's, to who knows what. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4040.5s)]
*  And is it the weight loss, or is it the drug? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4043.1s)]
*  It's the weight loss. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4046.38s)]
*  Of course. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4048.1s)]
*  That's right, and there's been studies [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4048.94s)]
*  that something quite magical about it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4050.34s)]
*  But I think that people that are even those [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4052.82s)]
*  that are advocates for these drugs would admit that. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4055.46s)]
*  No, not really. Really? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4057.54s)]
*  No, no, there's some special magic in these drugs. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4058.86s)]
*  No, it's that being obese and overweight [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4062.06s)]
*  just has terrible downstream effects on everything. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4065.06s)]
*  It fixes the insulin resistance, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4067.1400000000003s)]
*  the problem we were talking about before. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4068.42s)]
*  So when you improve insulin sensitivity, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4070.3s)]
*  the downstream consequences that are huge, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4073.78s)]
*  everything from fixing depression, to reversing Alzheimer's, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4075.78s)]
*  to preventing heart disease, diabetes, cancer, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4079.26s)]
*  these are all diseases of insulin resistance. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4081.5s)]
*  Not all cancers, but the most common ones, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4083.2200000000003s)]
*  breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic, colon cancer, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4085.3s)]
*  these are predominantly diseases [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4088.9s)]
*  that are more associated with obesity and insulin resistance. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4092.02s)]
*  So I think they have a role, Barry, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4094.5400000000004s)]
*  but I think we're way too far leaning on them, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4096.18s)]
*  and there'll be a backlash. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4099.14s)]
*  And I think the costs are staggering. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4100.820000000001s)]
*  If you look at the Medicare Part D, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4103.14s)]
*  which is the drug benefit, it's $145 billion a year. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4105.78s)]
*  It's a lot, but still, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4110.18s)]
*  if you take the just obese people on Medicare [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4113.26s)]
*  and you pay for Ozempic, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4115.7s)]
*  it's like, I think, $267 billion just for that. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4117.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4121.38s)]
*  Maybe if the price comes down in half, it's still a lot. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4122.22s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4124.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think it's sort of helped wake people up [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4125.78s)]
*  to the fact that this maybe isn't a moral feeling, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4129.66s)]
*  that there's some metabolic things going on, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4132.62s)]
*  that you can take a shot and all of a sudden you lose weight. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4134.42s)]
*  Like, what's going on here? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4136.82s)]
*  It's sort of helping people. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4139.0599999999995s)]
*  It is profound. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4139.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's profound. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4140.9s)]
*  I mean, it's profound in terms, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4142.22s)]
*  like for people that have tried really hard to lose weight, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4143.66s)]
*  feeling like, oh, wait, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4146.74s)]
*  it really does quiet the noise. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4149.46s)]
*  I mean, everyone's talked about this, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4151.5s)]
*  but it quiets the noise in your mind around food. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4152.62s)]
*  The noise in your mind is your nucleus accumbens [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4155.099999999999s)]
*  shouting at you to eat more. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4158.22s)]
*  My what? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4160.1s)]
*  Your nucleus accumbens, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4160.9400000000005s)]
*  which is the addiction center in your brain [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4161.780000000001s)]
*  that gets hits of dopamine from cocaine or heroin [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4164.38s)]
*  or smoking or sex or sugar. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4167.18s)]
*  And the noise is literally, yeah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4172.34s)]
*  I mean, in animal studies, these are kind of cruel, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4175.14s)]
*  but they would put mice on an electrical pad [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4176.9400000000005s)]
*  and they would allow them to have sugar. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4179.66s)]
*  And then they would start shocking them. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4182.02s)]
*  And they would keep eating the sugar [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4183.18s)]
*  almost to the point of death. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4185.26s)]
*  They've done the same thing with cocaine. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4188.06s)]
*  They give them intravenous cocaine [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4189.7s)]
*  and they can hit the button, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4191.22s)]
*  get as much cocaine as they want. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4192.06s)]
*  They'll work eight times harder to get sugar than cocaine. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4193.14s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4195.9s)]
*  And why do you think people get to be five, 600 pounds? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4196.94s)]
*  It's not that they like it or they want to be like that. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4202.02s)]
*  They can't stop, even though they're killing themselves. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4204.7s)]
*  So there is a shift from that. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4211.22s)]
*  And that's why I was talking about something [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4213.26s)]
*  like the 10-day detox, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4215.22s)]
*  because there is a way to shut off that addiction. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4216.06s)]
*  But I think what's important to admit [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4221.02s)]
*  is that it's very hard. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4222.9800000000005s)]
*  It's hard if you don't know what to do. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4224.860000000001s)]
*  Like when you're saying it's easy, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4226.1s)]
*  it's like it's not easy. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4227.26s)]
*  It's hard if you don't know what to do. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4228.740000000001s)]
*  No, even if I'm saying, even if you do know what to do, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4229.740000000001s)]
*  it's hard to change. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4233.580000000001s)]
*  It's hard to shift. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4234.900000000001s)]
*  It's hard to shift. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4235.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to shift. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4236.700000000001s)]
*  And I agree. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4237.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to shift [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4238.54s)]
*  because this addiction is so powerful. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4239.660000000001s)]
*  But I did a program with Rick Warren [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4241.22s)]
*  at Saddleback Church called the Daniel Plan, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4244.02s)]
*  which is this faith-based wellness program. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4246.9800000000005s)]
*  We got 15,000 people to lose [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4248.540000000001s)]
*  a quarter million pounds in a year. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4250.1s)]
*  And this was a very unhealthy fat population. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4251.26s)]
*  And this is one of the most famous evangelical pastors [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4254.38s)]
*  in the country. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4256.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's amazing. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4257.22s)]
*  And he came to see me and after a visit, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4258.06s)]
*  he was like, tell me about your church. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4261.580000000001s)]
*  I'm like a Jewish doctor from New York. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4263.34s)]
*  I don't really know much about this. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4264.540000000001s)]
*  He's like, well, we got 30,000 people. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4265.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, wow, it's a mega church. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4267.34s)]
*  He's like, no, we got 5,000 small groups [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4268.660000000001s)]
*  that meet every week. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4270.660000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's thousands of mini churches. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4271.5s)]
*  And I had the idea, why don't we use those groups [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4273.62s)]
*  to actually help people change their behavior? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4276.26s)]
*  Because it's hard to change behavior. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4279.34s)]
*  And it's hard to address these conditions, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4281.22s)]
*  which we call non-communicable diseases. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4283.94s)]
*  They're not infectious, but they're contagious. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4286.94s)]
*  You're 170% more likely to be overweight [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4289.46s)]
*  if your friends are overweight [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4291.74s)]
*  compared to if your family's overweight. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4292.66s)]
*  And so the social threads that connect us [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4295.58s)]
*  are more powerful than the genetic threads. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4298.38s)]
*  And we actually have the capacity [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4300.0199999999995s)]
*  to the power of positive peer pressure, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4301.66s)]
*  just as there's negative peer pressure like gangs, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4304.22s)]
*  to actually change behavior. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4306.42s)]
*  How do you get a kid to go kill someone? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4307.86s)]
*  It's positive peer pressure in a bad way. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4310.099999999999s)]
*  And the same thing can be true [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4313.26s)]
*  of adopting things that are hard, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4315.58s)]
*  like killing someone's hard. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4317.58s)]
*  I mean, you're like, just take a normal person [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4320.0599999999995s)]
*  and turn them into a killer is not easy. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4322.58s)]
*  And that's the power of peer pressure. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4324.66s)]
*  So we basically got these groups to do it in the church, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4326.86s)]
*  and it was incredibly successful. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4329.38s)]
*  We replicated that at a Cleveland Clinic [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4331.3s)]
*  with small groups and seen the same thing. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4332.62s)]
*  We actually wrote a book about it called The Daniel Plan. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4334.860000000001s)]
*  It was the number one New York Times bestseller, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4337.06s)]
*  and it won the Christian Book of the Year Award, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4339.1s)]
*  which I think I'm the only Jew to win that award. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4341.06s)]
*  You're definitely the first one. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4342.46s)]
*  Well, maybe it was that other guy 2,000 years ago. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4343.3s)]
*  But for those of us that have ever done Weight Watchers [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4344.780000000001s)]
*  and you go to the meeting, it's the same concept. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4347.26s)]
*  Same concept, AA, Weight Watchers. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4349.74s)]
*  It's all the same thing. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4351.1s)]
*  Okay, one thing we haven't talked about so far [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4352.38s)]
*  when we're talking about the sort of health crisis [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4355.02s)]
*  in America is the mental health crisis. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4357.38s)]
*  And I think most people think of those as separate things. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4359.86s)]
*  Right, there's a crisis in our physical health, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4363.82s)]
*  and then there's a crisis in our mental health. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4366.5s)]
*  You are saying, and I think functional medicine is saying, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4368.139999999999s)]
*  those are deeply interconnected. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4370.78s)]
*  Explain that. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4372.46s)]
*  Completely. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4373.299999999999s)]
*  There's a joke in medicine that neurologists [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4374.139999999999s)]
*  pay no attention to the mind, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4375.78s)]
*  and psychiatrists pay no attention to the brain. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4377.179999999999s)]
*  Like below the neck, there's like no connection, right? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4381.74s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4384.66s)]
*  Everything that happens to your biology [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4385.58s)]
*  happens to all of your biology, including your brain. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4386.94s)]
*  And I wrote a book about this 15 years ago [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4390.58s)]
*  called The Ultramind Solution, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4392.46s)]
*  about how to fix your broken brain [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4393.3s)]
*  by fixing your body first. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4394.139999999999s)]
*  And it was kind of an outlier book. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4394.98s)]
*  It didn't do that well. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4396.9s)]
*  And I think it was because it was way ahead of its time. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4397.82s)]
*  You should maybe republish it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4400.3s)]
*  Because I was seeing in my patients [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4401.62s)]
*  when I would fix their autoimmune disease [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4403.7s)]
*  or fix their digestive issues [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4405.139999999999s)]
*  or fix whatever was going on, their diabetes, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4406.54s)]
*  that they'd tell me, oh, my ADD is better. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4408.66s)]
*  My depression is better. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4411.0199999999995s)]
*  My bipolar disease is better. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4411.98s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4413.139999999999s)]
*  My memory is better. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4414.86s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4415.7s)]
*  And so I started to look down the rabbit hole, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4416.5199999999995s)]
*  and even then there was a lot of literature [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4418.22s)]
*  that supported this. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4419.860000000001s)]
*  And now you've got departments of metabolic psychiatry [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4420.7s)]
*  at Stanford, of nutritional psychiatry at Harvard. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4423.38s)]
*  You've got Chris Palmer, who wrote a book called [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4425.54s)]
*  Brain Energy, talking about how he cured schizophrenics [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4427.820000000001s)]
*  by changing their diet and bipolar disease. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4430.14s)]
*  Mayo Clinic just got a $3 million grant [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4432.26s)]
*  to study ketogenic diets in severe mental illness, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4434.3s)]
*  like schizophrenia and bipolar. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4437.360000000001s)]
*  And even in depression, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4439.42s)]
*  these things are profoundly effective. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4440.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think what's happening is that [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4442.820000000001s)]
*  we're now understanding the link [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4444.62s)]
*  between metabolic dysfunction [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4445.740000000001s)]
*  and the same thing that makes you have belly fat [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4449.06s)]
*  also affecting your brain. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4450.5s)]
*  And I think this is a revolution in psychiatry [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4452.26s)]
*  that's happening so fast that most people [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4454.58s)]
*  aren't even aware it's happening. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4457.06s)]
*  But if you're paying attention, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4458.54s)]
*  you're seeing these signals in the literature. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4459.88s)]
*  And it's complicated, because it's not one thing, right? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4461.820000000001s)]
*  Your microbiome can affect your brain. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4465.9400000000005s)]
*  Your nutritional status can affect your brain. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4467.4400000000005s)]
*  Your, obviously, level of insulin resistance [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4469.38s)]
*  can affect your brain. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4473.12s)]
*  And so you have to sort of look at all the variables. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4474.22s)]
*  And this is where medicine fails. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4476.780000000001s)]
*  We don't look at all the variables. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4479.04s)]
*  It could be a problem with a patient. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4479.88s)]
*  We want to find the single thing, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4481.68s)]
*  like the bacteria that Louis Pasteur figured [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4482.8s)]
*  causes these. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4485.16s)]
*  And it's just not how the body's organized. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4486.0s)]
*  And so with mental health, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4488.2s)]
*  we're in this incredibly exciting revolution [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4490.36s)]
*  where we're understanding the link between the body [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4492.32s)]
*  and the brain, not the mind-body connection, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4493.86s)]
*  but the body-mind connection. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4495.32s)]
*  And you have to do both. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4497.4s)]
*  It's not one or the other. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4498.64s)]
*  You mentioned gluten a few times [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4500.0s)]
*  as being sort of like a demonic force. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4501.32s)]
*  For what? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4503.88s)]
*  Bread is the staff of life. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4505.32s)]
*  How is gluten connected to depression? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4506.6s)]
*  I feel like that's something that I hear about, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4510.84s)]
*  vaguely, like in the corners of the internet. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4512.76s)]
*  Why is gluten such a villain? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4516.240000000001s)]
*  First of all, the wheat we eat is not the wheat we ate. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4517.84s)]
*  And the amount of gluten in modern wheat [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4521.04s)]
*  and the dwarf wheat is far greater [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4523.400000000001s)]
*  than the wheat that we used to eat. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4525.68s)]
*  There was heirloom wheat, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4527.64s)]
*  or when I was in Sardinia and they had this granocappelli, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4528.4800000000005s)]
*  which is ancient wheat, very different. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4531.96s)]
*  And when you have large amounts of gluten [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4534.52s)]
*  and you have all these other factors that I mentioned [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4537.32s)]
*  that affect the gut, it causes a breakdown in the gut, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4538.719999999999s)]
*  in the lining of the gut, called the lice of this leaky gut. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4542.639999999999s)]
*  And this is Alessio Fasano's sort of first discovered this. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4545.959999999999s)]
*  He's a Harvard professor, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4548.44s)]
*  one of the leading scientists in the world [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4549.639999999999s)]
*  on celiac and gluten. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4551.48s)]
*  And he showed that gluten does this. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4553.28s)]
*  It creates a damage to the lining. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4555.28s)]
*  And then you get this cascade of inflammation. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4557.799999999999s)]
*  Depression is an inflammatory disease of the brain. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4560.0s)]
*  How do you know that? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4563.719999999999s)]
*  Look it up on PubMed. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4565.34s)]
*  It's like the national. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4567.1s)]
*  What do you mean an inflammatory disease of the brain? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4567.9400000000005s)]
*  If you look at brains and people who are depressed [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4568.78s)]
*  or have mental illness, their brains are inflamed. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4572.860000000001s)]
*  So you can look at the, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4576.18s)]
*  I mean, I don't want how much detail I'm gonna get into, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4577.9400000000005s)]
*  but there's an immune system in the brain that's activated. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4579.5s)]
*  And there's systemic inflammation [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4582.7s)]
*  that also drives mental illness [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4584.78s)]
*  through activating these inflammatory pathways. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4586.78s)]
*  Alzheimer's is inflammation of the brain. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4589.3s)]
*  Autism is inflammation of the brain. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4590.900000000001s)]
*  ADD is inflammation of the brain. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4592.38s)]
*  And so these are all inflammatory brain disease. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4594.18s)]
*  It's a final common pathway for many insults, right? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4595.9800000000005s)]
*  Diet, toxins, stress, whatever, microbiome changes, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4598.38s)]
*  all that leads to brain inflammation. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4601.54s)]
*  And so they were even talking about using biologics [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4603.740000000001s)]
*  like they use in autoimmune disease to treat depression [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4606.700000000001s)]
*  in order to actually reduce the inflammation in the brain. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4609.38s)]
*  That's why an anti-inflammatory diet works [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4611.660000000001s)]
*  to help to relieve mental illness. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4614.02s)]
*  That's why ketogenic diet works [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4616.26s)]
*  because it's a profoundly anti-inflammatory diet. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4617.62s)]
*  And it really changes the metabolic function of the brain. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4620.26s)]
*  So gluten is one of those things that drives inflammation [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4623.18s)]
*  across a whole spectrum of human biology. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4625.9800000000005s)]
*  And it can cause so many diseases, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4628.820000000001s)]
*  everything from depression to autoimmune diseases. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4630.58s)]
*  Are you saying like, eat less bread, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4633.3s)]
*  you'll be less depressed? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4635.38s)]
*  Is it that simple? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4636.820000000001s)]
*  I love bread. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4637.740000000001s)]
*  But are you saying, eat less gluten? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4639.900000000001s)]
*  Let me, eat less gluten. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4642.14s)]
*  I'm saying if you're going to eat bread, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4643.42s)]
*  and this is a hard thing to do in America, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4646.18s)]
*  try to get grains that are not modern wheat. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4649.58s)]
*  Try to get more heirloom grains, ancient grains. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4652.58s)]
*  And there are bakeries that make food like this. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4654.7s)]
*  They're better for you. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4656.98s)]
*  And I think that's where I would lean to. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4658.94s)]
*  So I was at a restaurant last night with my daughter [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4661.26s)]
*  who's just graduated medical school, by the way, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4664.18s)]
*  and learned zero about nutrition. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4666.58s)]
*  Are you going into family business together? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4671.5s)]
*  No, she's going to be my orthopedic surgeon. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4672.86s)]
*  Oh wow, oh she's a killer. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4674.9s)]
*  Yeah, she's serious. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4676.38s)]
*  She's like way smarter than I am. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4677.5s)]
*  I could never have gotten in. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4679.94s)]
*  She, and there was on the menu, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4681.38s)]
*  this local restaurant in Austin, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4683.7s)]
*  they had farmer table menu, they had locally raised grains, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4685.18s)]
*  they were heirloom grains, they turned to sourdough bread [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4687.9400000000005s)]
*  that changes the way that actually the gluten affects you. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4690.66s)]
*  And it was delicious and I ate some. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4693.66s)]
*  And did it affect me badly? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4695.22s)]
*  No. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4696.22s)]
*  But if I had the modern wheat, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4697.06s)]
*  which also has all kinds of other additives to it, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4698.38s)]
*  and it's raised differently in terms of, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4701.38s)]
*  I mean, the leaven differently, quickly, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4704.78s)]
*  and it just has a lot of consequences that are harmful. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4707.18s)]
*  So I would say modern wheat is a problem. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4710.22s)]
*  So a takeaway for someone listening to this, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4712.780000000001s)]
*  who's like, I'm not at all talking about [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4715.06s)]
*  severe mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar, all of that, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4718.280000000001s)]
*  but someone that's suffering from maybe low grade depression, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4721.34s)]
*  exhaustion, anxiety, what are the top three things [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4725.14s)]
*  they can do with their diet quickly? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4729.820000000001s)]
*  Because then I want to talk to you about toxins. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4732.06s)]
*  What are the top three things they could do right now? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4733.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, you want to find out [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4736.46s)]
*  if food is making a difference or not. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4737.7s)]
*  Because it could be something else, right? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4739.06s)]
*  So I love the 10-day detox, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4740.820000000001s)]
*  because it essentially gives you 10 days [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4742.54s)]
*  to see what's connected to food. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4744.14s)]
*  You take out all the bad stuff in, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4745.780000000001s)]
*  you put in all the good stuff, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4747.22s)]
*  and you see where your body's at. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4748.620000000001s)]
*  And after 10 days, you'll see, I'm not depressed anymore. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4750.02s)]
*  I don't have anxiety attacks. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4752.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can have anxiety attacks [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4753.34s)]
*  because your blood sugar is going up and down, right? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4755.38s)]
*  Because low blood sugar is a biological emergency, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4757.580000000001s)]
*  and you're going to get anxious, your heart's going to race, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4760.46s)]
*  you're going to have heightened awareness, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4763.02s)]
*  you're going to want to go find food. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4764.780000000001s)]
*  You want to go find food. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4766.5s)]
*  It's hypoglycemia is a real thing. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4768.34s)]
*  And so you have to see what your biology is doing [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4769.94s)]
*  in relation to food. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4772.9s)]
*  So just do an experiment on yourself. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4773.74s)]
*  Don't trust me. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4776.4s)]
*  Ugh, I'm going to have to do it. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4777.24s)]
*  Okay, I'm doing it. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4778.38s)]
*  I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4779.62s)]
*  And then you can see, you feel good. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4780.94s)]
*  If you go to 10daydetox.com and it explains how to do it, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4782.92s)]
*  it's super easy. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4785.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, toxins, toxins. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4785.94s)]
*  This is a word that I- [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4788.66s)]
*  People have allergies too. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4790.86s)]
*  I am allergic to this word. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4792.0599999999995s)]
*  I feel that I hear it, and people are like, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4793.74s)]
*  I got to detox my life. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4795.66s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4797.0199999999995s)]
*  Again, common sense tells me that heating up plastic, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4799.86s)]
*  drinking out of hot plastic, not great. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4803.94s)]
*  Go for glass. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4806.34s)]
*  I get that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4807.179999999999s)]
*  But then it goes down these rabbit holes. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4808.0199999999995s)]
*  I can't really follow it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4809.58s)]
*  So give me the TLDR, Mark Hyman riff on toxins. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4810.5s)]
*  I mean, toxins are compounds that are either biologic [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4816.0199999999995s)]
*  or elemental or synthetic. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4822.259999999999s)]
*  So biological would be if your kidney shut down, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4825.64s)]
*  your liver shuts down, you're going to die [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4827.4400000000005s)]
*  from the toxic metabolic waste. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4829.240000000001s)]
*  Synthetic toxin would be plastic, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4832.12s)]
*  and elemental toxin would be mercury or lead. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4833.68s)]
*  These are things that are naturally found [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4835.320000000001s)]
*  in the environment or our stick. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4836.4400000000005s)]
*  We're all exposed to these things. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4838.3s)]
*  We can't get away from them. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4839.8s)]
*  And like I said about the baby study, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4840.96s)]
*  even a newborn baby is loaded with it, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4843.160000000001s)]
*  breast milk's loaded with it. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4844.92s)]
*  I mean, it's enough to make you a miss sugar, right? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4846.280000000001s)]
*  But there are ways to just reduce your load on the one hand [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4848.820000000001s)]
*  and two, to increase your body's ability [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4853.360000000001s)]
*  to get rid of them on the other hand. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4855.4s)]
*  So that's what I explain to people. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4856.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm on the board of the Environmental Working Group, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4858.32s)]
*  and they have wonderful guides on what vegetables [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4860.24s)]
*  and fruits have the most pesticides [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4862.96s)]
*  and which have the least. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4864.879999999999s)]
*  They call it the dirty dozen and clean 15. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4865.719999999999s)]
*  They say, here's the fish. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4867.48s)]
*  Has the least mercury or the most mercury? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4869.0599999999995s)]
*  Choose the least mercury fish. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4871.36s)]
*  Here's the household cleaning products [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4872.96s)]
*  that don't contain all these toxins. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4874.5599999999995s)]
*  Why should you have stuff in your house [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4877.24s)]
*  that we have to lock away from a baby? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4878.46s)]
*  Like, how is it not bad for the baby, but not bad for us? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4880.24s)]
*  What are the household cleaning? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4884.04s)]
*  What are the skincare products? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4884.92s)]
*  Are you putting lipstick on that has lead in it? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4886.0s)]
*  What are the products you can use? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4888.16s)]
*  So you can kind of slowly. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4889.68s)]
*  Let me look at this lip gloss in my pocket right now. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4891.28s)]
*  Okay, you're going to look later. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4895.0s)]
*  There's nothing at all on here. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4896.36s)]
*  I love the Environmental Working Groups. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4898.4400000000005s)]
*  It's deeply scientific. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4899.72s)]
*  They do deep research, and they serve up [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4900.96s)]
*  in a very simple way how to sort of remove [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4903.42s)]
*  the most common sources of environmental toxins. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4906.36s)]
*  Have an air filter in your house. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4908.64s)]
*  Reverse osmosis water filter. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4910.24s)]
*  Is that important? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4912.72s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4913.62s)]
*  There are 38 wastewater contaminants [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4915.6s)]
*  in the average tap water. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4916.96s)]
*  Everything from, I mean, what about all the women [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  on hormones, where does that go in the birth control? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4920.4400000000005s)]
*  It goes in the water. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4922.0s)]
*  What about statins? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4922.84s)]
*  What about all the leaching from the rivers [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4923.66s)]
*  and the streams that are filling your water supply? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4926.12s)]
*  So, I feel- [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4928.04s)]
*  Oh, Mark, there's so much I have to do [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4928.88s)]
*  after this conversation. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4929.7s)]
*  I know, it's a lot of work. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4930.54s)]
*  But once you get it set up, it's not that hard. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4931.38s)]
*  I have a water filter in my house. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4932.84s)]
*  I, you know, have an air filter in my house. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4934.56s)]
*  But can I be real with you? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4937.96s)]
*  Like, you have all the, you have everything [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4938.84s)]
*  at your disposal. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4942.72s)]
*  Every resource in the world. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4943.64s)]
*  Most people, like, the basic level of you're a taxpayer, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4944.84s)]
*  living in a democracy, you have a government [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4950.96s)]
*  that spends God knows how much money a year. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4953.76s)]
*  And the idea that we need to, like, personally go out [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4956.400000000001s)]
*  and fix the air in our homes and the water coming [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4959.200000000001s)]
*  out of our tap does seem insane to me. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4962.200000000001s)]
*  It's insane, we shouldn't have to. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4964.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, if the EPA was doing a job, it wouldn't have to. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4965.64s)]
*  And there are a lot of good things happening right now [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4968.1s)]
*  on one hand in the government. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4971.04s)]
*  I think the movement towards trying to rethink [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4972.56s)]
*  how we're doing research, how we're thinking about [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4974.72s)]
*  addressing the problems with our food system [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4978.200000000001s)]
*  and agricultural system, I'm all for that. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4979.76s)]
*  But the deregulation of the chemical and toxin industry, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4982.120000000001s)]
*  that worries me, because I think on the one hand, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4986.080000000001s)]
*  we're maybe helping things, on the other hand, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4987.740000000001s)]
*  we're making things worse. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4989.160000000001s)]
*  And I think, you know, we'll learn more and more, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4990.4400000000005s)]
*  but I do think they have an incredible role. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4992.240000000001s)]
*  I personally know the role that toxins can have. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4994.56s)]
*  I had mercury poisoning. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4998.080000000001s)]
*  So I know personally how bad it can affect your health. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=4999.48s)]
*  And I've treated thousands of patients who have toxic loads, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  whether it's from heavy metals or other things. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5005.719999999999s)]
*  And certain things are hard to measure, right? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5007.4s)]
*  Pesticides are hard to measure, toxins are hard to measure. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5008.879999999999s)]
*  But you can do different urine tests or different tests. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5011.5199999999995s)]
*  But I think that people shouldn't get too worried [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5013.799999999999s)]
*  about getting in the weeds about it. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5016.16s)]
*  They should just do the best they can [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5017.44s)]
*  to reduce their exposures. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5019.44s)]
*  Just ewg.org is a great resource for that. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5021.599999999999s)]
*  And second, help your body get rid of stuff. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5024.759999999999s)]
*  So make sure you're drinking plenty of water. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5027.88s)]
*  Make sure you're pooping, eating plenty of fiber. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5029.56s)]
*  Make sure you're sweating. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5032.08s)]
*  You can exercise or take a hot bath, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5033.04s)]
*  or if you're lucky enough, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5035.16s)]
*  get in a sauna at a gym or something. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5036.36s)]
*  Simple things you can do. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5038.400000000001s)]
*  I call it the poop, perspire, and pee system, right? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5039.4400000000005s)]
*  We have a built-in system. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5043.6s)]
*  Eat vegetables that help your body get rid of toxins, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5045.24s)]
*  like the broccoli family, like garlic and onions, right? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5047.68s)]
*  Simple things you can do. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5050.5s)]
*  You can afford supplements. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5051.72s)]
*  You might want to take something called NAC, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5052.64s)]
*  which helps boost glutathione, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5054.28s)]
*  the main detoxifier in your body. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5055.88s)]
*  But these are simple things that you can do [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5057.24s)]
*  that don't cost a lot of money, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5058.88s)]
*  that you can incorporate into your life. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5060.16s)]
*  And I don't think about it every day. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5062.48s)]
*  I just sort of structure my life [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5063.92s)]
*  in a way that these are automatic. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5065.24s)]
*  Because if you want to do right things, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5066.88s)]
*  I don't want to have to like pour water into a water filter, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5068.76s)]
*  wait till it, I kind of want to do that. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5072.32s)]
*  I want to just open my tap and get the clean water, right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5074.04s)]
*  So make it simple. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5076.2s)]
*  Okay, Mark, let's talk a little bit about the Maha Movement. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5077.36s)]
*  And I would say for sure the standard bearer [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5080.44s)]
*  of that movement, controversial guy Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5082.639999999999s)]
*  How long have the two of you been friends? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5086.44s)]
*  Long time, since 2000, somewhere in there. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5088.0s)]
*  Okay, I think he's a lightning rod of a person. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5092.08s)]
*  Some people feel he is- [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5095.719999999999s)]
*  Love him or hate him. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5096.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, or just are intrigued by him. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5097.799999999999s)]
*  But yes, he really has pointed to some villains [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5100.48s)]
*  in the story of the health epidemic in America. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  And those villains that he has pointed out [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5109.16s)]
*  have kind of come up in this conversation. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5111.4s)]
*  It's basically big food and big pharma. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5112.919999999999s)]
*  And that, I would say that the Maha Movement [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5115.96s)]
*  is more of like a spectrum, right? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5118.8s)]
*  There's people on it who are like my wife, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5120.52s)]
*  who are like, why do I need to worry about [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5122.76s)]
*  what comes out of the tap? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5124.68s)]
*  Things should just work well. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5126.04s)]
*  I shouldn't have to worry. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5127.76s)]
*  I don't want bugs in my water, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5128.6s)]
*  but I also don't want bugs in my plate. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5130.96s)]
*  I don't want to get too crazy. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5132.68s)]
*  Maha. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5134.28s)]
*  And then there's people on a much fringier side [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5135.12s)]
*  of this movement. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5137.6s)]
*  Give them all vaccines. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5138.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I would say like broadly though, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5139.28s)]
*  this movement is about fighting, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5142.4s)]
*  maybe would be a way to put it, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5147.28s)]
*  the influence or the capture of big pharma and big food. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5148.96s)]
*  Would you, do you think that that's an accurate way [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5154.679999999999s)]
*  to describe it? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5156.48s)]
*  And do you think that that's a winnable battle? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5157.32s)]
*  I think it is winnable. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5160.08s)]
*  I mean, think about the history of this country [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5162.04s)]
*  and the things that we've had to overcome. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5163.92s)]
*  Slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5165.32s)]
*  women's rights, gay rights. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5170.16s)]
*  These are things we just take for granted now, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5172.96s)]
*  but they were completely sort of heretical ideas at the time [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5174.36s)]
*  that I mean, one of them led to a civil war. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5179.36s)]
*  So we can change as a country. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5181.72s)]
*  And I think what's happening now is this sort [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5184.16s)]
*  of a recognition that the emperor has no clothes, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5186.12s)]
*  that the medical industrial complex, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5189.52s)]
*  the pharmaceutical medical industrial complex, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5193.08s)]
*  the agricultural medical and pharmaceutical industrial [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5195.28s)]
*  complex is a thing. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5198.56s)]
*  I call it the toxic triad, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5199.88s)]
*  big food, big pharma and big egg. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5202.92s)]
*  And they're responsible for more deaths [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5204.12s)]
*  than almost anything else in human history. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5206.68s)]
*  And all wars combined. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5209.4s)]
*  And food is the number one killer on the planet today, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5211.6s)]
*  more than cigarettes. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5213.68s)]
*  And what's happened is this invisible takeover [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5215.44s)]
*  of our society at every single level by these industries. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5219.96s)]
*  And I'll just unpack it for you so you can understand. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5224.08s)]
*  I wrote a book about it called Food Fix, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5225.8s)]
*  How to Save Our Health, Our Economy, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5227.32s)]
*  and Food Fix Our Planet. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5228.68s)]
*  You literally have a book for everything. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5229.52s)]
*  I have a book for everything. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5230.36s)]
*  I'm not like, I hit pause after 20 books. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5231.36s)]
*  But, and I unpacked this in the book in great detail. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5234.36s)]
*  And what's really clear is that these industries [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5239.679999999999s)]
*  lobby more than any other industry. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5244.04s)]
*  They influence lawmakers at state and federal levels [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5246.96s)]
*  to do their bidding unwittingly. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5250.72s)]
*  They go, here's the science, here's what it shows, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5252.8s)]
*  here's why you should do this, here's why you should do that. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5254.48s)]
*  And they write the regulations, the legislations, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5255.84s)]
*  and they're extremely influential. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5258.0s)]
*  Second, they fund all our academic institutions, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5259.92s)]
*  the research at most academic institutions, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5262.68s)]
*  whether it's land-grant colleges are funded by Big Ag, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5264.96s)]
*  or medical schools and research institutes funded [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5267.2s)]
*  by Big Pharma. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5270.28s)]
*  And they shape the narrative of what's happening. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5272.2s)]
*  They fund front groups like the American Council [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5274.88s)]

*  that's funded by all these pesticide makers [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5279.4800000000005s)]
*  in the tobacco industry and the list goes on and on. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5282.76s)]
*  They think trans fats, cigarettes, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5285.68s)]
*  and pesticides are all fine. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5289.68s)]
*  This is kind of in their mission statement. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5292.72s)]
*  That's their mission statement. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5295.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and it sounds great, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5296.4800000000005s)]
*  like the American Council on Science and Health, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5297.84s)]
*  they came after Dr. Oz, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5299.280000000001s)]
*  and it was in the front page of the New York Times, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5300.8s)]
*  and I was very disappointed in the New York Times [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5302.200000000001s)]
*  because they didn't bother to do a shred of research [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5303.56s)]
*  into who these people were, where they were funded, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5305.68s)]
*  or whether half of them had been in jail before for fraud. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5307.84s)]
*  It was kind of crazy when they asked Columbia [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5311.12s)]
*  to get Oz off their faculty because he was a quack. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5314.16s)]
*  And it was just because of this, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5317.280000000001s)]
*  he was sort of outing a lot of this stuff. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5318.56s)]
*  They fund social groups like the NAACP [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5320.52s)]
*  and the Hispanic Federation in order to actually [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5322.76s)]
*  get them to support their policies, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5325.4800000000005s)]
*  like opposing soda taxes. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5326.88s)]
*  During the time when we were socializing [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5328.84s)]
*  Fed Up the Movie, I was in Atlanta, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5332.0s)]
*  and I met Bernice King, Marla King's daughter, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5334.120000000001s)]
*  and I told her about it. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5335.88s)]
*  She was very excited about it, and I said, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5337.0s)]
*  why don't we show this at the King Center in Atlanta? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5338.240000000001s)]
*  She was like, great idea. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5340.68s)]
*  Couple days later, I got a call, can't do it. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5341.88s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5343.320000000001s)]
*  Because the King Center's funded by Coca-Cola. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5344.4800000000005s)]
*  Coca-Cola's in Atlanta. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5346.68s)]
*  They also co-opt all the professional associations, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5348.96s)]
*  like the American Academy of Pediatrics, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5354.160000000001s)]
*  American Heart Association gets $192 million [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5357.360000000001s)]
*  from the Food and Farm Ministry. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5360.4400000000005s)]
*  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5361.92s)]
*  which is the main nutrition society in America, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5363.240000000001s)]
*  40% of their funding comes from big food. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5365.88s)]
*  They have their conferences, and you walk in, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5368.040000000001s)]
*  it's like, I've been there. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5369.68s)]
*  No photographs allowed. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5371.160000000001s)]
*  Because the whole exhibition hall is all processed crab, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5373.080000000001s)]
*  big food shit. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5377.44s)]
*  So at every level, whether it's the federal government, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5379.24s)]
*  state governments, whether it's professional associations, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5381.48s)]
*  social groups, front groups, lobbying, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5383.32s)]
*  I mean, they just have done a takeover. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5385.4s)]
*  The media, I mean, turn on the television. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5387.0s)]
*  It's pharma and food ads. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5389.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, I watched Super Bowl last year. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5391.32s)]
*  I turned it off. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5392.5199999999995s)]
*  There were 11 junk food ads in the first half of the show. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5393.36s)]
*  I mean, just to choose one concrete example [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5398.24s)]
*  for people that are now furiously Googling [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5400.96s)]
*  to find out all of what you just explained. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5403.48s)]
*  Or Chachabi tea. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5406.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, we spend billions of dollars a year [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5407.4800000000005s)]
*  on soda with food stamps. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5410.6s)]
*  You can buy Coca-Cola with food stamps. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5412.28s)]
*  And right now, big food is trying, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5414.96s)]
*  and some of these advocacy groups are trying to keep [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5417.96s)]
*  things like Pepsi and Coke on snap. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5421.16s)]
*  How is that even a question? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5425.96s)]
*  Like, why should taxpayers be paying for Coca-Cola? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5427.84s)]
*  We're going to have to put the bill in the end of the day [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5431.8s)]
*  for people getting all of the diseases [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5434.28s)]
*  we've been talking about from drinking it. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5437.8s)]
*  I mean, 20% of Coke's US profits come from snap. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5439.679999999999s)]
*  Probably a third of Walmart's profits come from snap, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5444.4s)]
*  from selling junk. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5448.28s)]
*  And this didn't happen by accident. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5450.08s)]
*  The hunger groups out there [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5453.04s)]
*  are funded by the food industry. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5455.84s)]
*  So when you look at their boards [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5458.0s)]
*  and you look at the funding, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5459.12s)]
*  the ones that are saying, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5460.4s)]
*  it's discriminatory against the poor, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5462.64s)]
*  it's regressive, it's racist, it's whatever, classes. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5464.76s)]
*  To do this, you're restricting access to them [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5469.56s)]
*  to something they should be able to eat. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5471.56s)]
*  When you look at snap, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5472.96s)]
*  it was started to deal with poverty and malnutrition. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5473.8s)]
*  After Robert F. Kennedy, Sr. went to Appalachia [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5476.8s)]
*  and uncovered the extreme poverty in America, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5480.320000000001s)]
*  it was designed to uplift Americans. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5482.8s)]
*  And it was called [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5484.160000000001s)]
*  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5485.0s)]
*  Now, what we have is a food security program, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5488.4s)]
*  meaning you have enough calories. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5492.04s)]
*  We don't have a nutrition security program, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5493.5199999999995s)]
*  which provides enough nutrients. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5495.44s)]
*  And so we have $125 billion a year program, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5497.12s)]
*  one of the biggest federal programs out there. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5499.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the largest part of the farm bill, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5501.5599999999995s)]
*  which should be called the food bill. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5504.08s)]
*  It's basically 75% junk food and 10% soda. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5506.639999999999s)]
*  So that's $12 billion or so of soda a year we pay for [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5511.4s)]
*  from our taxpayer dollars. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5515.719999999999s)]
*  We pay four times for that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5518.400000000001s)]
*  The true cost of food is not what we're paying [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5520.0s)]
*  at the checkout counter. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5522.08s)]
*  The true cost of food is all the externalities, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5523.56s)]
*  or maybe they're not really externalities. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5526.240000000001s)]
*  They're just natural part of it. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5527.8s)]
*  We don't count them. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5528.8s)]
*  For example, we fund farmers to grow corn. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5529.76s)]
*  That corn gets turned into a high-fat source of corn syrup. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5533.56s)]
*  That gets made into soda. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5536.240000000001s)]
*  Then the government pays for it [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5537.56s)]
*  to be distributed to the poor, 46 million people. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5538.72s)]
*  Then we pay for the consequences of them consuming that [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5542.240000000001s)]
*  on Medicare and Medicaid [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5544.68s)]
*  because they get diabetes and obesity [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5546.08s)]
*  and chronic illness. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5548.400000000001s)]
*  Shouldn't it be a no-brainer [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5549.240000000001s)]
*  that Coca-Cola shouldn't be on, you know? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5550.160000000001s)]
*  It is. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5552.4400000000005s)]
*  It should be, but the amount of pushback on that [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5553.280000000001s)]
*  is enormous. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5556.96s)]
*  But what's exciting to me, we see for the first time, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5557.8s)]
*  West Virginia is the most obese state in the nation. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5559.8s)]
*  Patrick Morrissey is the new governor. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5562.88s)]
*  He signed the first bill to eliminate dyes [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5565.080000000001s)]
*  and additives to food and preservatives. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5568.040000000001s)]
*  And he also signed snap wapers, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5570.120000000001s)]
*  which allows them to restrict soda and study it. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5572.64s)]
*  Before this, it was never possible. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5575.8s)]
*  And what happened was the USDA wouldn't even allow, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5578.64s)]
*  because Bloomberg wanted to do this in New York, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5581.320000000001s)]
*  it wouldn't even allow a pilot study [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5582.8s)]
*  to see the impact of what changing, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5585.68s)]
*  what you could buy on Snap would do to you [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5588.68s)]
*  in terms of your health. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5591.16s)]
*  Like, what would happen if you restricted soda or junk food? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5592.16s)]
*  They wouldn't even allow them to study it. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5594.92s)]
*  I mean, I was involved with, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5597.0s)]
*  because I have a nonprofit where I help sort of advocate [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5598.68s)]
*  for healthier food and different policies. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5601.0s)]
*  I was working on an initiative with Andy Harris, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5603.04s)]
*  who's a doctor, a Republican, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5606.48s)]
*  who put in a bill to do a couple of state study [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5608.72s)]
*  on what would happen if we changed Snap [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5612.32s)]
*  and got soda out of Snap. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5614.68s)]
*  The Democrats shut it down, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5616.84s)]
*  and it was completely shut down. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5618.32s)]
*  Why? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5619.96s)]
*  I mean, this doesn't make sense to me. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5620.8s)]
*  We shouldn't be paying for this. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5622.08s)]
*  If people wanna do it, that's fine. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5624.2s)]
*  And the rationale is they'll buy it anyway. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5625.64s)]
*  It's regressive, it's discriminating against the poor. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5627.24s)]
*  This is all food industry talking points. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5629.4s)]
*  When you pull back the veil, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5631.68s)]
*  you see who's really behind this. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5632.52s)]
*  It's not very confusing. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5633.88s)]
*  So the amount of money and lobbying [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5635.68s)]
*  to keep it as it is, is enormous. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5637.280000000001s)]
*  And it's gonna take states across the country. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5639.4800000000005s)]
*  Utah passed a Snap waiver bill. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5641.96s)]
*  It's starting to happen. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5644.04s)]
*  There's over 30 states that have, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5645.16s)]
*  some of them bipartisan bills, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5647.240000000001s)]
*  some maybe 10 introduced by Republicans, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5648.4400000000005s)]
*  20 introduced by Republicans, 10 by Democrats, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5650.8s)]
*  are across the nation starting to move [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5653.16s)]
*  towards these agendas of Snap reform, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5655.84s)]
*  of getting crap out of schools, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5658.16s)]
*  about getting dyes out of our food. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5659.8s)]
*  It's quite exciting to see. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5662.360000000001s)]
*  I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5663.200000000001s)]
*  Are you feeling bullish on the Maha movement right now? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5664.88s)]
*  I think it's one of those moments [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5668.92s)]
*  that's full of opportunity, but fraught with danger. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5670.64s)]
*  What are the dangers? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5675.84s)]
*  Well, I think the dangers are one, execution. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5676.84s)]
*  It has to be smart execution and the right levers [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5680.360000000001s)]
*  to pull to make the changes that need to happen [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5683.6s)]
*  and be able to push back on the war room [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5686.040000000001s)]
*  that the food industry is putting together now. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5688.6s)]
*  I have some inside information about this. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5690.52s)]
*  I know that these big trade groups are creating a war plan. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5693.0s)]
*  What's the inside information? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5696.44s)]
*  What's the war plan? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5697.76s)]
*  Why not? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5698.68s)]
*  I can tell you what the war plan is. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5699.52s)]
*  Break news, what do you mean? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5700.36s)]
*  I can tell you what the war plan is. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5701.2s)]
*  I can't tell you where I got it. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5702.04s)]
*  I'll have to kill you. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5702.88s)]
*  You don't have to tell me where you got it. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5703.72s)]
*  Deep throat. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5704.92s)]
*  Never have to give up your sourcing, but I'll tell you. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5705.76s)]
*  Make news, tell us. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5708.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they basically have created a war plan [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5709.56s)]
*  where they mapped out on a federal and state level [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5711.92s)]
*  how they're going to lobby and influence lawmakers, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5715.12s)]
*  how they're going to influence elections, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5718.88s)]
*  how they're going to create grassroots, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5720.52s)]
*  fake grassroots movements and put out propaganda [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5722.8s)]
*  to kind of oppose this. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5725.52s)]
*  And at every level, they're strategic about this. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5727.16s)]
*  I mean, this is not new. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5729.68s)]
*  I mean, when there was a GMO labeling bill [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5731.32s)]
*  in Washington state, the food industry got together, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5733.28s)]
*  a bunch of these big food companies. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5736.2s)]
*  Not that many of them, it was like 10, 11, 12 companies [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5737.6s)]
*  that control all things. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5740.16s)]
*  Like you said, Poppy was bought by Coke. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5741.0s)]
*  They all own all the healthy brands. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5742.68s)]
*  And they basically, but their big bucks [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5744.76s)]
*  come from the crap they sell. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5747.320000000001s)]
*  They colluded to oppose the GMO labeling law [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5748.96s)]
*  in Washington state and they won. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5752.0s)]
*  They spent so much money that they won. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5754.24s)]
*  And then they got sued and had to pay a fine of like, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5756.52s)]
*  I don't know, some big quote, big fine of like $15 million [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5759.56s)]
*  that was an antitrust basically fine for them, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5763.280000000001s)]
*  for them colluding. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5766.12s)]
*  Same thing happened in California [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5767.2s)]
*  where all these soda taxes are being passed. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5768.72s)]
*  Remember that Berkeley passes soda tax. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5770.280000000001s)]
*  What happened all that? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5772.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, the American Beverage Association [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5774.0s)]
*  went to the mansion and Governor Brown, Jerry Brown, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5776.36s)]
*  who's Governor Moonbeam can be more left, right? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5779.04s)]
*  They said to him, look, we're putting this ballot initiative [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5782.72s)]
*  and we're going to promote it and we're going to get it passed. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5786.24s)]
*  It has nothing to do with food, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5788.6s)]
*  but it mandates that two thirds vote for any law passed [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5789.6s)]
*  at any level of city, state, and any government in the state, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5793.44s)]
*  which would have crippled the government. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5798.28s)]
*  It had nothing to do with food. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5800.12s)]
*  They said, we're going to pass this [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5800.96s)]
*  and you're going to be screwed unless you pass a law [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5802.32s)]
*  that prevents any further soda taxes. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5805.48s)]
*  Not one. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5809.2s)]
*  That's how they operate. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5810.04s)]
*  So I'm not like saying, oh, there's a big conspiracy. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5811.2s)]
*  I know exactly how they're doing it. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5815.04s)]
*  And if you do a little bit of investigation, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5816.759999999999s)]
*  it's not hard to find these facts or what's going on. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5818.599999999999s)]
*  Do you understand why people are skeptical [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5820.96s)]
*  of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5823.04s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5825.36s)]
*  I mean, when you read anything in the media about him, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5826.2s)]
*  it says, Robert F. Kennedy, anti-vax conspiracy theorist, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5828.08s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5832.16s)]
*  So anybody reading that is going to go, wow, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5834.0s)]
*  this is a journalist, this is a reputable outlet. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5835.84s)]
*  They know what they're talking about. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5838.44s)]
*  This must be true. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5840.599999999999s)]
*  And nobody bothers to actually listen to what he says, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5842.08s)]
*  to read what he says, to take the time, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5845.0s)]
*  to spend hours studying what he said, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5847.0s)]
*  and actually understand the nuances of what he's doing. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5849.0s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to describe him [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5851.12s)]
*  as a vaccine skeptic? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5852.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5854.44s)]
*  When you look at how we got into this, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5857.0s)]
*  there were mothers who were attending his lectures [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5860.08s)]
*  about rivers, because he basically got [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5863.44s)]
*  the Hudson River cleaned up, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5866.16s)]
*  and he got General Electric to pay over a billion dollars [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5867.24s)]
*  to clean up the PCBs in the Hudson River [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5869.24s)]
*  right here in New York City. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5871.4s)]
*  He was one of the most successful environmental lawyers [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5872.719999999999s)]
*  in history. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5874.5199999999995s)]
*  He got multi-billion dollar settlements [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5875.36s)]
*  for glyphosate and its effect on human health. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5876.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, mothers come up to him and say, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5883.04s)]
*  hey, you're talking about mercury and fish. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5883.96s)]
*  Because by the way, the EPA says not a single river [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5886.839999999999s)]
*  like in America is safe to eat the fish [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5888.8s)]
*  because it's got too much mercury, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5890.400000000001s)]
*  because of all the coal burning and cement plants. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5891.76s)]
*  They said to him, why aren't you looking [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5894.4800000000005s)]
*  at the connection between mercury in vaccines [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5896.6s)]
*  and its effect on health? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5899.56s)]
*  Because my kid got a vaccination, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5900.64s)]
*  and something bad happened to them. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5902.88s)]
*  And so we started looking into it, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5905.0s)]
*  and started investigating it, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5907.16s)]
*  and he saw there was a there there. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5908.52s)]
*  Something was there. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5910.24s)]
*  And so we started saying, look, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5911.400000000001s)]
*  we need to have better data and science around vaccines. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5913.320000000001s)]
*  We need to have safe vaccines. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5916.6s)]
*  Now, when you hear the trope from the FDA formally, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5918.96s)]
*  or the scientific establishment, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5922.5199999999995s)]
*  vaccines are safe and effective. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5925.2s)]
*  That's a nonsense statement. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5928.12s)]
*  Or that the science has been settled, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5929.44s)]
*  or that it has been debunked. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5931.5599999999995s)]
*  These are the sort of statements that come out there. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5933.04s)]
*  Science has never settled. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5935.24s)]
*  That's the point of science. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5937.04s)]
*  Everything's an open question. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5938.4s)]
*  We used to think aspirin was great to prevent heart attacks. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5939.4s)]
*  Now we learn it kills a lot of people, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5941.799999999999s)]
*  and you shouldn't take it [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5943.12s)]
*  unless you have a high risk situation. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5943.96s)]
*  We used to think that stress caused ulcers [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5946.4s)]
*  until we found it was a bacteria, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5948.48s)]
*  and the guy who brought this up [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5949.599999999999s)]
*  was laughed out of his societies of gastroenterology [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5951.2s)]
*  until he drank a beaker of the bacteria, proved it, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5954.2s)]
*  and then he got the Nobel Prize. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5956.599999999999s)]
*  So ideas are hard to change. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5958.8s)]
*  So he's saying, I'm for getting the mercury out of rivers, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5960.92s)]
*  and having fish with no mercury. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5966.24s)]
*  Doesn't mean I'm anti-fish. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5967.8s)]
*  I'm for safe fish. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5969.16s)]
*  I'm not anti-plane if I'm for safe planes. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5972.4s)]
*  I'm not anti-flying. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5975.16s)]
*  So he's not anti-vaccine. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5976.5199999999995s)]
*  He's just saying we need that. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5977.72s)]
*  And when you look at the data, by the way, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5978.5599999999995s)]
*  and I can share this with you after, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5980.08s)]
*  you can share it with the audience. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5982.36s)]
*  The way vaccines are studied is against other vaccines. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5984.8s)]
*  It's not against a placebo. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5987.8s)]
*  So I want to study a new drug, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5989.96s)]
*  let's say a new anti-inflammatory drug like Advil or Leave, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5991.72s)]
*  and I should study it against a placebo, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5994.72s)]
*  not against Advil, right? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5996.68s)]
*  Because there's going to be an underlying baseline [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=5999.72s)]
*  of side effects. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6001.76s)]
*  We know Advil causes kidney failure, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6002.84s)]
*  and it causes gastrointestinal bleeding, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6004.52s)]
*  and it causes all these other things. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6006.360000000001s)]
*  But if you study against a placebo, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6007.8s)]
*  you'll see there'll be a difference. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6009.400000000001s)]
*  But vaccines are not studied against placebo. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6010.8s)]
*  That's a big problem. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6013.4400000000005s)]
*  So I think we need better data and better science. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6014.4400000000005s)]
*  And to say the science is settled is just anti-science. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6016.52s)]
*  You have a daughter. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6020.52s)]
*  I do. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6021.56s)]
*  Maybe at some point you'll have other kids. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6022.400000000001s)]
*  Did you vaccinate your daughter? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6023.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6025.96s)]
*  I've been vaccinated. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6026.780000000001s)]
*  I vaccinate my kids. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6027.620000000001s)]
*  I think vaccines are great advance. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6028.84s)]
*  But we have to have an honest conversation about it. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6030.68s)]
*  It's one of those conversations you're not allowed to have. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6032.52s)]
*  Like when I was at Cleveland Clinic, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6035.200000000001s)]
*  I wrote an article years ago [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6037.400000000001s)]
*  about an autistic kid that I treated [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6039.160000000001s)]
*  who was the son of a vice president at Pfizer [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6040.56s)]
*  who got autism, and it was regressive autism, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6043.34s)]
*  meaning they didn't have autism. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6046.160000000001s)]
*  They were a normal kid, and then they got autism [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6047.64s)]
*  when they were like 18 months old. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6049.280000000001s)]
*  And it was after a vaccination, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6051.320000000001s)]
*  and the mother just recounted the story to me. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6052.96s)]
*  And I just wrote it as part of my history in this article. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6054.580000000001s)]
*  And at the beginning of the article, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6057.160000000001s)]
*  I even said, disclaimer, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6058.240000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying vaccines cause autism. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6059.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm just noting this fact. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6060.92s)]
*  And the pediatric department at Cleveland Clinic [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6062.88s)]
*  were incensed, they thought I was anti-vaccine. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6065.26s)]
*  They said, you have to make a statement [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6066.96s)]
*  that say you're a pro-vaccine or you're fired, basically. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6068.12s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6071.32s)]
*  I wrote the letter, said I'm pro-vaccine, because I am. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6072.16s)]
*  I think vaccines have a role in medicine like drugs. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6074.58s)]
*  I mean, I'm- [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6076.6s)]
*  Do you think that there is a connection [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6077.4400000000005s)]
*  between autism and vaccines? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6078.88s)]
*  I think they can be a trigger. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6080.92s)]
*  I believe they can be a trigger. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6083.12s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6084.24s)]
*  So triggers are basically things [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6085.92s)]
*  that are the straw that broke the camel's back. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6089.52s)]
*  So if you're basically healthy, you're resilient. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6093.0s)]
*  But if you load up a kid who's not been born [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6097.6s)]
*  by vaginal birth, who's not been breastfed, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6100.52s)]
*  whose gut and immune system are underdeveloped, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6103.280000000001s)]
*  who's had lots of antibiotics, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6105.200000000001s)]
*  who get colds and sore throats in your eggs all the time, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6106.52s)]
*  and they're compromised, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6109.92s)]
*  and they have genetics that make them susceptible [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6112.040000000001s)]
*  to various injuries. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6114.84s)]
*  And by the way, Mayo has a whole department of vaccinomics, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6115.84s)]
*  which is how people respond to vaccines differently. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6118.96s)]
*  Then yeah, it might be that trigger [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6122.44s)]
*  that caused an immune irritation [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6124.4800000000005s)]
*  that led to some brain inflammation. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6126.76s)]
*  And autism is an inflammatory disease. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6128.44s)]
*  It's a disease of neuroinflammation. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6130.4s)]
*  Their brains are inflamed. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6132.42s)]
*  Their brains are larger on MRI scans. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6133.72s)]
*  So I'm not saying that vaccines cause autism. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6136.04s)]
*  I'm saying that they're part of a collection of insults [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6138.4800000000005s)]
*  that these kids might be susceptible to in certain kids. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6141.24s)]
*  And that's really what we have to look at. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6143.8s)]
*  We have to look at this in a very different way [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6145.24s)]
*  by taking out the emotion, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6148.48s)]
*  taking out all the controversy, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6150.759999999999s)]
*  and saying, what do we know? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6152.5199999999995s)]
*  What do we not know? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6153.679999999999s)]
*  Let's have an anonymous conversation about this. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6154.5199999999995s)]
*  I think the reason it does feel emotional [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6155.879999999999s)]
*  is because we think about the diseases [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6158.08s)]
*  that were pretty much wiped out [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6161.959999999999s)]
*  because of vaccinations like polio and measles. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6164.24s)]
*  And you see like- [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6168.32s)]
*  But Barry, the people don't know the data. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6169.759999999999s)]
*  By the time the measles vaccine got introduced, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6171.16s)]
*  there was already a 90% reduction in measles. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6173.639999999999s)]
*  A lot of the benefits that we see [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6175.44s)]
*  in terms of public health- [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6176.959999999999s)]
*  Like washing our hands. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6178.08s)]
*  Sanitation, hygiene, flush toilets. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6179.28s)]
*  Those had a dramatic effect on these diseases. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6181.68s)]
*  But the reason measles is coming back right now [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6184.0s)]
*  in certain places, including here in New York, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6185.84s)]
*  there have been a few cases, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6187.88s)]
*  is not because we've gotten rid of washing our hands [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6189.48s)]
*  and sanitation. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6193.28s)]
*  It's because the general conversation, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6194.12s)]
*  the reason that there is such a ring fence, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6196.48s)]
*  I think, around this conversation [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6198.32s)]
*  or around other conversations, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6201.28s)]
*  and we're living through an age for better, for worse, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6202.5199999999995s)]
*  where all the taboos and all the gatekeepers [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6204.28s)]
*  are getting torn down, again, for better and for worse. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6206.36s)]
*  I think the reason though that there is a ring fence [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6209.839999999999s)]
*  around it is because people are scared [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6212.04s)]
*  that if you introduce skepticism [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6215.12s)]
*  or put a question mark over this topic, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6218.0s)]
*  people will not vaccinate their kids [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6221.04s)]
*  for genuinely deadly diseases. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6222.679999999999s)]
*  I think the opposite is true. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6224.24s)]
*  I think having honest conversations with scientists [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6225.24s)]
*  and doctors about the real risks and benefits is important. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6227.719999999999s)]
*  So people can make choices and decisions. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6230.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not- [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6232.36s)]
*  I think to just say it's safe and effective, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6233.2s)]
*  there's no harm, never ever, no danger, is ridiculous. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6236.84s)]
*  In 1986, the US government, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6240.44s)]
*  after the swine flu kind of vaccine fiasco, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6243.5599999999995s)]
*  basically indemnified vaccine makers. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6247.639999999999s)]
*  They could never be sued for their product [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6250.599999999999s)]
*  and took on the responsibility. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6253.16s)]
*  And federal vaccine court has paid out [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6254.92s)]
*  on 2.6 million adverse events that have been reported, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6257.639999999999s)]
*  a number of those have gone to court, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6260.92s)]
*  and they paid out $5 billion in vaccine injury cases. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6262.48s)]
*  So to say they're safe and effective is just not scientific [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6267.16s)]
*  and that we should have an honest- [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6270.879999999999s)]
*  What is the- [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6272.04s)]
*  What should we say about them? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6272.879999999999s)]
*  We should say they're like any other medical intervention. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6274.44s)]
*  When I go get surgery or I have a procedure, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6277.12s)]
*  they say, okay, you could bleed to death, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6278.799999999999s)]
*  you can get infection, you can get this. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6280.04s)]
*  Why not have informed consent for vaccines [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6281.679999999999s)]
*  and actually know what's going on [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6283.679999999999s)]
*  and have actually better data and studies? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6285.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's all Bobby's talking about. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6287.4s)]
*  He's not against vaccines. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6289.0s)]
*  He's been vaccinated, his kids are all vaccinated. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6290.32s)]
*  He's not anti-vax. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6293.0s)]
*  What he is is trying to understand the nuances [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6294.599999999999s)]
*  that no one wants to talk about. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6297.599999999999s)]
*  And as a minute you bring it up, you get shut down. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6298.8s)]
*  And I think that's just unfair [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6302.16s)]
*  to the scientific process of inquiry about anything. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6304.08s)]
*  So I think you're a heretic if you say anything like that. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6307.5199999999995s)]
*  So people listening to this podcast will probably think, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6311.2s)]
*  oh, Dr. Hyman's a heretic, he's a quack, he's saying- [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6313.0s)]
*  I don't think they'll think that. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6315.32s)]
*  Maybe, but I'm like, it's just like, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6316.88s)]
*  look at the COVID vaccine. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6318.32s)]
*  That was one of the best studied vaccines ever. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6319.44s)]
*  And still there was people [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6321.759999999999s)]
*  who did have adverse effects from it. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6323.879999999999s)]
*  Myocarditis, we've written about a lot of it. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6326.12s)]
*  It's not like, it's not a new idea that can have a harm. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6329.08s)]
*  The question is whose benefits? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6334.36s)]
*  And yes, we should look at this robustly. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6335.599999999999s)]
*  And we should look at maybe the vaccine schedule we have [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6338.599999999999s)]
*  may be altered. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6341.12s)]
*  Maybe we should not be giving it to kids who are sick. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6341.96s)]
*  Maybe we should be waiting. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6344.5199999999995s)]
*  In fact, when I was in medical school in residency [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6345.719999999999s)]
*  and I trained in family medicine, did pediatrics, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6347.92s)]
*  we were told never give a vaccine [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6350.2s)]
*  to a kid who's got a cold. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6352.4400000000005s)]
*  It's really bad. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6354.0s)]
*  Like we didn't really, they weren't told [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6355.28s)]
*  it's what would happen. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6356.36s)]
*  They were like, it's bad. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6357.2s)]
*  They could have adverse effects and they could have reactions [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6358.6s)]
*  and just give it to healthy kids. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6360.6s)]
*  One thing, Mark, that I think is just true right now [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6362.8s)]
*  in general is we're living in a very exciting, wild, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6366.08s)]
*  but also chaotic and uncertain time [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6370.96s)]
*  in every area of American life. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6374.72s)]
*  And one of the questions that raises for people [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6376.96s)]
*  is who to trust. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6381.08s)]
*  Because I think if there's been a big theme [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6382.28s)]
*  of the last decade or so, maybe more, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6384.12s)]
*  it's that a lot of the authorities [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6387.2s)]
*  that we used to look to to trust sort of blindly [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6388.88s)]
*  have betrayed our trust or the internet has allowed us [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6391.92s)]
*  to check them and we've found them wanting. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6394.92s)]
*  How do you, what is a good heuristic? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6397.84s)]
*  What is a good rule of thumb for people about figuring out [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6399.92s)]
*  who and what to trust in the most important area, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6403.56s)]
*  arguably, of our life, which is health? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6407.52s)]
*  Chat-jee-bee-tee. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6409.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I think it's probably a better source [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6410.280000000001s)]
*  than most places because it's sort of agnostic. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6414.080000000001s)]
*  It doesn't have a point of view. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6417.040000000001s)]
*  And it looks at all the world's scientific literature. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6418.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm kind of being facetious, but I'm sort of not. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6420.56s)]
*  Because I think it's tough when you [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6422.88s)]
*  lost trust in institutions. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6425.0s)]
*  I mean, we've seen, Jim, like I think I said before, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6426.200000000001s)]
*  there's been a drop from 70% trust in medicine [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6428.52s)]
*  to 40% over the last decade. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6430.72s)]
*  That's staggering. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6432.68s)]
*  I mean, don't even look at the numbers on like media, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6434.08s)]
*  the law, like everything. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6436.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6437.320000000001s)]
*  Just so many things. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6438.160000000001s)]
*  And so the only way to reestablish trust [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6439.0s)]
*  is to engage in an honest dialogue, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6441.12s)]
*  treating citizens as though they were intelligent people [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6444.12s)]
*  who could take the truth and make informed decisions. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6448.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, I sat with Francis Collins and I said, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6451.88s)]
*  why didn't you use COVID as a teachable moment? [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6454.400000000001s)]
*  In medicine, when there's like someone's a smoker [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6457.96s)]
*  and they get lung cancer, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6459.68s)]
*  you say it's a teachable moment, right? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6461.12s)]
*  Stop smoking, right? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6463.56s)]
*  Why didn't you use COVID as a teachable moment [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6464.400000000001s)]
*  to call out the fact that because Americans [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6467.160000000001s)]
*  are so metabolic and healthy because of the food we're eating, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6469.84s)]
*  that we should improve our nutrition. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6472.88s)]
*  He said, oh, because we didn't want to blame the victim. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6474.52s)]
*  I'm like, that's the wrong perspective. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6476.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6478.4400000000005s)]
*  They're living in this toxic soup [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6479.4400000000005s)]
*  and we need to address these issues. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6480.96s)]
*  And you can do it in a way that empowers them [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6482.240000000001s)]
*  and not disempowers them. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6484.160000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the same true [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6485.200000000001s)]
*  with any kind of medical information. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6486.240000000001s)]
*  We should trust people to be able to take the truth [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6488.160000000001s)]
*  and say, when we don't know something, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6491.32s)]
*  we don't know all the answers. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6493.759999999999s)]
*  And the truth is we don't know the answers [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6495.04s)]
*  around a lot of things in medicine [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6496.92s)]
*  and we should be honest about it. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6498.679999999999s)]
*  Do you think things would be different [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6499.84s)]
*  if during the height of the COVID epidemic [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6501.92s)]
*  or in the beginning, our public health authorities, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6504.4s)]
*  rather than telling us things like, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6506.759999999999s)]
*  we didn't really need masks, no, we didn't need masks [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6510.12s)]
*  and all of these other. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6512.799999999999s)]
*  That anti-fascist, oh, six feet, we just made up. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6514.44s)]
*  I made that up. Right. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6516.12s)]
*  Do you think if instead they had said, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6517.799999999999s)]
*  hey guys, we don't know. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6519.52s)]
*  Or hey guys, we got that wrong yesterday [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6522.200000000001s)]
*  and we're gonna give you new information today. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6524.200000000001s)]
*  That would establish trust. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6525.76s)]
*  Saying, I don't know, or I made a mistake, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6527.360000000001s)]
*  here's what we now learned is true. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6530.120000000001s)]
*  That would build trust. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6533.200000000001s)]
*  But acting like you know everything [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6534.360000000001s)]
*  and you have the answer with a capital T, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6536.6s)]
*  I mean, it's just kind of silly. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6539.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, Americans should be trusted to understand [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6541.52s)]
*  and cope with what's true and be treated like adults, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6544.080000000001s)]
*  not like little children. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6547.64s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, are you ready for a lightning round? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6548.92s)]
*  I'm ready. Okay. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6551.16s)]
*  What is the weirdest health thing you do? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6552.72s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6555.56s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6557.32s)]
*  I mean, one of the things I do [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6558.36s)]
*  that I think is very helpful is sometimes plasma phoresis, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6559.52s)]
*  which is, or maybe even a word of one. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6562.84s)]
*  What is that? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6565.4400000000005s)]
*  Plasma phoresis is blood cleaning. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6566.28s)]
*  And essentially it's been around in medicine [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6568.6s)]
*  for a long time to treat autoimmune diseases [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6570.36s)]
*  and other neurologic problems. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6572.36s)]
*  But essentially it filters out your plasma [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6574.0s)]
*  and cleans out all the crap in there and throws it out [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6575.84s)]
*  and you put new plasma in essentially. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6577.56s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6579.0s)]
*  You basically hook yourself up to an IV machine [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6579.84s)]
*  and it takes your blood out, filters it, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6581.56s)]
*  gets rid of the plasma, separates out all the cells [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6583.6s)]
*  and the plasma is a soup that your blood cells float around [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6586.4400000000005s)]
*  in and it throws that out. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6588.88s)]
*  And then you add back in albumin, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6590.160000000001s)]
*  which is the main protein in your blood [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6591.64s)]
*  and you reconstitute your blood. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6593.080000000001s)]
*  So it's like a second oil filter and change. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6594.240000000001s)]
*  How long does that take? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6596.080000000001s)]
*  Couple hours. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6597.120000000001s)]
*  It's like an oil filter change. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6597.96s)]
*  What does it feel like as it's happening? [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6598.8s)]
*  It feels great. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6599.64s)]
*  It feels great. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6600.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you don't feel anything, but after you feel great, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6601.3s)]
*  you have more energy, brain clears up. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6602.76s)]
*  It's been used to actually impose COVID very effectively. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6604.64s)]
*  For many things. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6607.8s)]
*  Last time you had a French fry. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6608.92s)]
*  I had a French fry at The Kitchen, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6611.36s)]
*  which is my friend Kimma Mutt's restaurant in Austin [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6614.04s)]
*  and it was sort of the three day process [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6617.5599999999995s)]
*  of making French fries and they use, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6619.84s)]
*  they use like, I think out of these beef tallow [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6622.12s)]
*  or something like that, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6624.48s)]
*  but it's not like a McDonald's French fry. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6625.32s)]
*  So I'll eat a good French fry. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6626.72s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to list a few health trends. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6628.88s)]
*  Tell me one word or a few words if you must on each one. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6630.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6634.8s)]
*  Can also be yay or nay. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6635.88s)]
*  Aura ring. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6637.280000000001s)]
*  Yay. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6638.84s)]
*  Red light. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6639.76s)]
*  Yay. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6641.08s)]
*  EMF blockers. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6641.92s)]
*  Not so sure. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6644.68s)]
*  Reverse osmosis water filters you already said. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6645.76s)]
*  Hell yes. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6648.400000000001s)]
*  Blue light blockers. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6649.52s)]
*  Worth a try. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6652.360000000001s)]
*  Sauna. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6653.68s)]
*  Love it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6654.76s)]
*  Cold plunge. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6655.6s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6656.6s)]
*  Do you do it every day? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6657.42s)]
*  When I'm home. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6658.26s)]
*  Breath work or meditation. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6660.56s)]
*  Absolutely, the data is strong on that. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6662.8s)]
*  MDMA. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6666.0s)]
*  Speaking for a friend, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6667.92s)]
*  I think it's an incredible advance in psychiatry. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6670.48s)]
*  I mean, the work of Rip Doblin and MAPS [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6673.28s)]
*  to show its effect in PTSD depression [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6675.5199999999995s)]
*  works better than anything else we have [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6677.5599999999995s)]
*  in medicine and psychiatry. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6679.04s)]
*  And that's by the way, why it was not approved by the FDA [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6679.88s)]
*  because they're so co-opted by pharma. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6683.799999999999s)]
*  Should women get off of hormonal birth control? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6685.4s)]
*  I know that's more than a word, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6688.54s)]
*  but it's an important question. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6689.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it's very personal [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6691.32s)]
*  and I think it depends on their risk factors, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6692.84s)]
*  their biology, their symptoms, what you're using it for. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6695.52s)]
*  But obviously the pill was a huge part [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6698.32s)]
*  of women's liberation, freedom. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6700.68s)]
*  And I think it's not an easy yes or no answer. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6702.08s)]
*  It depends on the individual. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6706.04s)]
*  Do you think the impacts of it have been understudied? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6708.6s)]
*  I think there are risks to it. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6711.74s)]
*  And I think there are risks, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6712.88s)]
*  like cancer risks and other risks. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6714.36s)]
*  So I think it's not a benign treatment [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6715.56s)]
*  like any other treatment. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6718.28s)]
*  So I think they probably have been understudied [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6719.2s)]
*  because it was such a boon to humanity. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6720.96s)]
*  A question I promised all of the 25 year old women [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6722.96s)]
*  in this office, leggings, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6725.56s)]
*  specifically like Lululemon Aloe leggings. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6727.4800000000005s)]
*  They want to know if they're full of toxins or not. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6730.4s)]
*  Or do they need to? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6732.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a problem. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6733.76s)]
*  They need to begin to like sew their own garments [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6735.2s)]
*  from the sheeps that they shear. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6738.76s)]
*  There are new companies coming out [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6740.6s)]
*  with sort of natural fiber yoga garments. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6741.76s)]
*  But I think the reality is that a lot of the ways [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6744.12s)]
*  in which our clothes are now made are use plastics, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6747.0s)]
*  use PFAS chemicals, the flame retardants, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6749.84s)]
*  have microplastics in them. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6753.16s)]
*  So how much those are affecting your health? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6754.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6756.6s)]
*  Is it better to do yoga than worry about your leggings? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6757.4400000000005s)]
*  Probably. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6759.84s)]
*  What is the best piece of health advice you've ever gotten? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6761.52s)]
*  That food is medicine. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6769.360000000001s)]
*  What is the most important change you have made [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6772.14s)]
*  in your adult life to your routine [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6776.8s)]
*  that has improved your health and your happiness? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6780.26s)]
*  Oh, that's easy. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6781.5s)]
*  So I'm a tall, thin guy, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6782.46s)]
*  for those of you listening and not watching the podcast, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6785.0599999999995s)]
*  and I was a runner. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6787.86s)]
*  I did yoga. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6789.14s)]
*  And even though I knew that strength training was important, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6790.46s)]
*  I thought gyms were smelly. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6793.42s)]
*  I was intimidated by all the big, muscly guys, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6795.5s)]
*  and I didn't think I had to do it. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6798.0199999999995s)]
*  And the biggest change I made when I was 59, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6800.58s)]
*  I started strength training, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6802.54s)]
*  and it's revolutionized my health and my life. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6803.66s)]
*  How has it revolutionized your life? [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6806.74s)]
*  I feel stronger, more stable, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6808.82s)]
*  more able to do more athletic feats than I could before. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6811.3s)]
*  I mean, I was in January, last year, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6815.66s)]
*  and we were in Patagonia, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6817.54s)]
*  and we hiked 15 miles in a day, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6818.38s)]
*  up a mile straight vertical, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6820.78s)]
*  went on crampons on the ice. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6823.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, did all kinds of stuff that a 65-year-old didn't do. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6824.82s)]
*  I went helicopter skiing [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6826.66s)]
*  and jumped out of a helicopter and skied. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6828.5s)]
*  These are things that the average 60, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6830.62s)]
*  and I'd never done it before. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6831.78s)]
*  So I want to be able to wake up in the morning [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6832.94s)]
*  and do whatever the fuck I want [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6834.46s)]
*  without having the restrictions of my body. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6835.98s)]
*  I do have some restrictions, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6838.54s)]
*  but I get away with a lot [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6839.660000000001s)]
*  because I am paying attention to what I eat [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6841.1s)]
*  and also to strength training, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6843.700000000001s)]
*  which becomes more and more important as you get older. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6845.38s)]
*  You've mentioned lots of books in this conversation. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6847.42s)]
*  Recommend three books to our listeners, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6850.780000000001s)]
*  exempting the 15 or so, maybe the 20 that you've written. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6854.38s)]
*  What are the two or three books that people should read, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6857.780000000001s)]
*  health, science, medicine, or not, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6861.38s)]
*  that have had the biggest impact on you? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6864.18s)]
*  I don't know if they should read them, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6866.26s)]
*  but the books that impacted me the most [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6867.46s)]
*  was Walden by Henry Thoreau, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6869.860000000001s)]
*  which basically structured my vision [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6872.06s)]
*  of what life could and should look like and how to live, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6875.26s)]
*  and really foundational principles, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6877.900000000001s)]
*  like basically live life to the fullest, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6879.9800000000005s)]
*  don't leave any stone unturned, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6882.26s)]
*  build your castles in the air [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6884.14s)]
*  and build foundations under them. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6885.38s)]
*  Just dream big and go for it. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6886.66s)]
*  I think The Unselling of America [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6891.5s)]
*  was a very impactful book for me by Wendell Berry, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6893.860000000001s)]
*  which was really about the destruction [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6896.06s)]
*  of our agricultural system, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6898.18s)]
*  the disenfranchisement of the small farmers. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6899.820000000001s)]
*  It wasn't one book, but it was Jack Kerouac as an author, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6909.02s)]
*  maybe Desolation Angels, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6913.38s)]
*  which really set me out on this path [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6914.700000000001s)]
*  of being on the wild adventure [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6916.900000000001s)]
*  and having a crazy wisdom way of living [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6918.900000000001s)]
*  that's not on the beaten path. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6921.780000000001s)]
*  Those are the books I would say. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6924.46s)]
*  I had a guy on recently, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6926.46s)]
*  who I'm sure you've heard of called Brian Johnson. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6927.78s)]
*  He believes he is not going to die [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6930.02s)]
*  and that we are going to live forever. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6931.3s)]
*  I don't think that we're not going to die, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6932.7s)]
*  but do you think that in our lifetimes, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6934.3s)]
*  we're going to be able to see life expectancy [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6936.78s)]
*  and quality of life change in a dramatic way? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6939.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the advances in sanitation [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6941.9400000000005s)]
*  and hygiene has doubled our lifespan in this last century, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6944.42s)]
*  and the advances in medicine [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6947.54s)]
*  have deviated another 10 or 15% to that. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6949.58s)]
*  But we're not going to get to live to 120 [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6952.9s)]
*  without fundamentally understanding health and disease [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6956.66s)]
*  in a different way. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6959.219999999999s)]
*  It's not about finding the drug for Alzheimer's, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6960.0599999999995s)]
*  the drug for cancer, the drug for heart disease, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6961.78s)]
*  the drug for diabetes, which we've been doing forever, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6963.5s)]
*  and it hasn't really worked to reduce our healthcare costs [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6965.5s)]
*  or improve health outcomes [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6967.9s)]
*  or reduce the incidence of these diseases. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6968.9s)]
*  We just get better at treating them. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6970.86s)]
*  What has to finally change [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6972.74s)]
*  is our understanding of the nature of human biology, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6973.82s)]
*  which is getting to the root causes [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6976.98s)]
*  and the hallmarks of aging, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6978.58s)]
*  which we talked about earlier, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6979.7s)]
*  basically this new understanding [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6980.98s)]
*  of the underlying mechanisms [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6982.139999999999s)]
*  that underlie all these chronic disease of aging, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6983.9s)]
*  to see disease as not an inevitable part of aging, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6986.74s)]
*  to see aging itself not as a disease, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6989.94s)]
*  but as something that can be associated with vibrancy [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6992.5s)]
*  and energy and activity well into our 80s, 90s, hundreds. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6995.0599999999995s)]
*  That's going to happen when we unlock this part of our biology, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=6999.82s)]
*  and I think that that's not going to extend life [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7004.099999999999s)]
*  by five to seven years, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7005.86s)]
*  which would happen if we ended cancer and heart disease [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7006.94s)]
*  completely, it would only extend life by five to seven years, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7010.099999999999s)]
*  but it could unlock another 30 or 40 years, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7013.099999999999s)]
*  meaning we could live to not 80 or 85, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7015.62s)]
*  but 110, 120. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7017.86s)]
*  And so I think that might happen in my lifetime. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7020.259999999999s)]
*  There's some kind of cool things [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7022.82s)]
*  that are happening around that. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7023.82s)]
*  We didn't dive into that, but I think it's coming. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7024.74s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, thank you so much for joining me. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7028.099999999999s)]
*  My pleasure. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kTV0ufjpuU&t=7030.62s)]
