Sometimes we have a guest who needs no introduction. You know Dana Perino. She took on the job of White House press secretary when President George W. Bush was at his most unpopular—back in 2007 and 2008, as the Iraq War dragged on. She did not receive a warm welcome from those covering the White House—outlets like The New Republic called her clueless, and she was even injured after an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at Bush.

It was not an easy job but, as anyone who served in the press corps back then will tell you, she did it masterfully.

Then she went to Fox News, where she quickly became a fixture. Today, she co-hosts America’s Newsroom in the morning and also co-hosts the highest-rated show on cable—Fox News’ The Five—where she is both the moral arbiter and the straight man.

Today on Honestly, Bari asks Dana about the moments of great tumult at Fox News and in news media more broadly. She asks Dana what she makes of Trump’s media strategy—including the administration’s open mocking of deportees.

# Fox News Host Dana Perino: Cable News is Not Dead
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=0.0s)]
*  Sometimes we have a guest on this show who truly needs no introduction. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=4.0s)]
*  You know Dana Perino. She took on the job of White House press secretary [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=8.0s)]
*  when President George W. Bush was at his most unpopular [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=12.0s)]
*  back in 2007 and 2008 as the Iraq War dragged on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=16.0s)]
*  She did not receive, suffice it to say, a warm welcome from those covering the White House, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=20.0s)]
*  outlets like the New Republic called her clueless, and she was even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=24.0s)]
*  injured when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=28.0s)]
*  It was not an easy job, but as anyone who served in the White House press corps [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=32.0s)]
*  back then will tell you, she did it masterfully. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=36.0s)]
*  Then she went on to Fox News where Dana quickly became a fixture. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=40.0s)]
*  Today she co-hosts America's Newsroom in the morning and is the lead anchor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=44.0s)]
*  of the highest rated show on cable, Fox News is the Five, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=48.0s)]
*  where she is both the moral arbiter and the straight man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=52.0s)]
*  Honestly, I asked Dana about the moments of great tumult at Fox News [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=56.0s)]
*  and in news media more broadly. I asked her what she makes of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=60.0s)]
*  Trump's media strategy, including the way the administration openly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=64.0s)]
*  mocks deportees. But Dana is also pretty well known for being [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=68.0s)]
*  a mentor and she has a new book out that allows those who don't know her [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=72.0s)]
*  to access that wisdom. It's called I Wish Someone Had Told Me, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=76.0s)]
*  the Best Advice for Building a Great Career and a Meaningful Life, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=80.0s)]
*  which just hit bookstores and it's full of practical advice, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=84.0s)]
*  not just from Dana, but from her friends, including many of her colleagues. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=88.0s)]
*  It covers everything from starting off at the workplace to keeping your career [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=92.0s)]
*  afloat during the ups and downs that inevitably come your way. She talks about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=96.0s)]
*  how to stay healthy, keeping yourself financially secure, dealing with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=100.0s)]
*  bad bosses and coworkers, handling your personal relationships [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=104.0s)]
*  and the endless struggle of finding a work-life balance, something [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=108.0s)]
*  that I am learning by working with half of my family. From her time at Fox [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=112.0s)]
*  and Republican politics, Dana knows quite a bit about navigating [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=116.0s)]
*  through chaos and keeping your head above water and smiling a little bit [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=120.0s)]
*  in the meantime. You're going to learn a lot from this one. And because I cannot help myself, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=124.0s)]
*  of course, we also talk about the news. Stay with us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=128.0s)]
*  Dana Perino, welcome to Honestly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=136.0s)]
*  Thank you. I feel like I'm a stalker. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=140.0s)]
*  Don't call security. You're not a stalker. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=144.0s)]
*  I really am a huge fan of you and Nellie. And as I got to meet some of the other folks here, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=148.0s)]
*  all the writers, I got to meet River Page. Oh my God, it's an amazing byline. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=152.0s)]
*  It's just a great name. First of all, the name is brilliant. I thought it was an actor. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=156.0s)]
*  I was an early subscriber and I love to give it as a gift. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=160.0s)]
*  I think that it is one of the best things that has kept me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=164.0s)]
*  more informed and smarter and also super entertained. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=168.0s)]
*  Well, I have to say, I have now met in the past decade of my life, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=172.0s)]
*  but especially in the past few years, a lot of people that have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=176.0s)]
*  a very shiny public persona and a very different [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=180.0s)]
*  personality in private. Let's just be generous about it, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=184.0s)]
*  not say two-faced. You are probably [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=188.0s)]
*  the person who I think about. It's not only that your public persona [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=192.0s)]
*  and your private persona match and there's no gap. It's that the private [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=196.0s)]
*  Dana is even more gracious and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=200.0s)]
*  shining than the public one. And it's not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=204.0s)]
*  surprising to me that you have this new book out that's really about [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=208.0s)]
*  advice for people's careers, for people's lives. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=212.0s)]
*  It's called, what is it called, Dana? It's called I Wish Someone Had Told Me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=216.0s)]
*  And it comes from my mom who when she read Everything Will Be Okay, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=220.0s)]
*  Life Lessons for Young Women from a Former Young Woman, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=224.0s)]
*  my mom read that book and she called me and said, I wish somebody had told me this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=228.0s)]
*  Because she started working in the 1960s [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=232.0s)]
*  and that was when women were the pioneers and they paved the way for the rest of us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=236.0s)]
*  And so that book was really geared towards [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=240.0s)]
*  young women and their quarter life crisis. And then [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=244.0s)]
*  post-COVID I felt like, you know what, we need a refresh. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=248.0s)]
*  It almost feels like COVID was this moment where you stopped the computer, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=252.0s)]
*  you know when you restart the computer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=256.0s)]
*  I know I'm pushing the button in my mind. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=260.0s)]
*  But my point is you are a person who [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=264.0s)]
*  models gracious, frankly just [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=268.0s)]
*  classy behavior. The kind of class that I think a lot of people have forgotten. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=272.0s)]
*  And so not surprising to me that you would write a book giving people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=276.0s)]
*  I think pretty fantastic advice that we're going to talk about for their career, for their life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=280.0s)]
*  Amazingly you open a book that's presumably about career advice with advice [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=284.0s)]
*  about love, which I think is smart. I want to talk about that in a little bit. I want to start [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=288.0s)]
*  by just talking about you. Tell us about like how you sort of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=292.0s)]
*  came up in local news. Well I loved local news. I watched all of it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=296.0s)]
*  And I still do. When I go on vacation I'm like, let's just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=300.0s)]
*  watch the local news and see what's happening. I love it all. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=304.0s)]
*  But it has really diminished and that's unfortunate. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=308.0s)]
*  I worked at the PBS station on my college campus. So I covered the Colorado [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=312.0s)]
*  State Legislature in graduate school. I covered the Illinois State Legislature. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=316.0s)]
*  But I also covered other things. And at the time, instead of Wikipedia, I had [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=320.0s)]
*  1-800-MediaLine. And that's what you called in order to find out what jobs [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=324.0s)]
*  were available around the country. And as I was listening to this I'm like, how do you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=328.0s)]
*  Wait, I don't understand. They would literally just list jobs? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=332.0s)]
*  Like local TV affiliate Milwaukee. That's exactly right. And then you'd have a code [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=336.0s)]
*  number. Push 5-4-3-1 if you're interested in the job [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=340.0s)]
*  in Milwaukee. Yeah. This is how it was. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=344.0s)]
*  It was before the internets and all those things. But it was pretty [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=348.0s)]
*  clear to me that the path to success [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=352.0s)]
*  was a hard one. And I didn't see how you could get ahead. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=356.0s)]
*  And I also experienced media bias for the first time in my life in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=360.0s)]
*  that newsroom in Illinois, in Springfield, Illinois. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=364.0s)]
*  The Republicans had taken over for the first time in many, many moons. And [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=368.0s)]
*  I didn't even, I grew up in Wyoming and Colorado. I didn't really know that many people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=372.0s)]
*  who didn't think the way I did even though I thought we were pretty common-sensical, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=376.0s)]
*  pretty libertarian to be honest. And [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=380.0s)]
*  long story short, I called my dad and said, I think I just got a graduate degree [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=384.0s)]
*  in something I don't want to do. Thankfully he said, come home. What happened? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=388.0s)]
*  I went home, I was waiting tables and then I heard about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=392.0s)]
*  a job open in the State House as the Deputy Press Secretary. Now I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=396.0s)]
*  used to watch the White House briefings. I used to watch the West Wing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=400.0s)]
*  And I thought, oh, Deputy Press Secretary at the State House [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=404.0s)]
*  and a congressman that I had interviewed before when I worked [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=408.0s)]
*  at the PBS station, I said, I wonder if I call them if they'd be a reference for me [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=412.0s)]
*  because I knew they knew each other. When I called, the chief of staff said, oh, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=416.0s)]
*  come work for us. I thought she might go back to Pueblo, Colorado [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=420.0s)]
*  and I was like, I'm not doing that. But it was in D.C. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=424.0s)]
*  And I sweated it for several days. One of the things I talk about is that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=428.0s)]
*  your horizons at that age end here. And I thought if I don't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=432.0s)]
*  stay in TV, if I take this job and I move to Washington, D.C. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=436.0s)]
*  and I work in the nation's capital, that's my path. I'm going to have to work in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=440.0s)]
*  politics the rest of my life. But I decided to do it. I prayed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=444.0s)]
*  about it, woke up one day and was like, OK, God, this is what you want. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=448.0s)]
*  Six weeks later, I ended up getting a job as the press secretary [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=452.0s)]
*  to a congressman from Colorado. And then two years later, I was on an airplane [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=456.0s)]
*  and my life changed dramatically. Tell us about that. So I [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=460.0s)]
*  was 25. I very much wanted to meet somebody and to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=464.0s)]
*  get married. And it just was not happening in D.C. I mean, girls, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=468.0s)]
*  am I right? It's not a good scene. The dating scene was not good [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=472.0s)]
*  back then. I don't think it's gotten much better. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=476.0s)]
*  The Internet's broken dating for literally everyone. But you have like such [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=480.0s)]
*  an analog story that you're about to tell of how you met [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=484.0s)]
*  someone, which I think is going to make a lot of people jealous, frankly. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=488.0s)]
*  Or maybe it will help to give them hope. So I had to go back to Colorado [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=492.0s)]
*  with the congressman. He's doing a round of media, do those things. And then [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=496.0s)]
*  I'm flying back to D.C., Denver, Chicago, D.C. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=500.0s)]
*  I almost missed the flight. I was randomly seated next to a guy [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=504.0s)]
*  who was, we were the last two people to get on the plane. It was an American Airlines flight. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=508.0s)]
*  Seats A and C. I was in A at the window seat. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=512.0s)]
*  And I sat down and this British guy, older than me, says, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=516.0s)]
*  would you like me to put your bag up above? Now I'm only five feet [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=520.0s)]
*  tall. Barely. And I always need my bag so I could [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=524.0s)]
*  put my feet on it because my feet usually don't touch the ground, or the floor. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=528.0s)]
*  So back then, no AirPods, no phones. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=532.0s)]
*  Books. He had a book, The Tailor of Panama, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=536.0s)]
*  by John Le Carre. I was reading Beloved. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=540.0s)]
*  Actually left it on the flight, never finished the last three chapters. Have no idea how it ends. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=544.0s)]
*  But people talk about that book all the time. I'm like, oh yeah, I read it mostly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=548.0s)]
*  And we talked for two and a half hours and I remember looking out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=552.0s)]
*  the window and saying, alright Lord, I know I asked you to help me find somebody, but [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=556.0s)]
*  we're on a plane. He lives in England. He's a lot older than me. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=560.0s)]
*  He could be an ex-murderer. And how could this be happening? But I felt it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=564.0s)]
*  And eight months later I moved to England and we've been married 28 years. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=568.0s)]
*  So that is the kind of advice that those of us that sort of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=572.0s)]
*  grew up in the girl boss era, that would have been the opposite of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=576.0s)]
*  what we were told to do. Me too. Yeah. So how did you decide to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=580.0s)]
*  ignore all of that? Mostly, I knew I wanted to be with him. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=584.0s)]
*  I loved him. I loved him. I loved him deeply. I couldn't sleep. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=588.0s)]
*  I couldn't eat. I couldn't think straight. I was a wreck. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=592.0s)]
*  And we decided we wanted to be together, but then I was like, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=596.0s)]
*  what are people going to think about me? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=600.0s)]
*  My career could end. But my career, looking back, I'm like, I was a house press secretary. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=604.0s)]
*  Not a big deal, but [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=608.0s)]
*  I was really worried about what my parents would think of me and what [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=612.0s)]
*  my friends would think of me. And mostly it was about the age difference. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=616.0s)]
*  He's about 20 years older. 18. Yep. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=620.0s)]
*  And so I went home and a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=624.0s)]
*  family friend named Kim Wilkerson, she has since passed, but she took me aside. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=628.0s)]
*  She goes, what's going on with this guy? So I told her and I told her my concerns and she said [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=632.0s)]
*  no, no, no. Do not give up on this chance to be loved. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=636.0s)]
*  It might be the only chance you get. And so I built up [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=640.0s)]
*  the courage. I remember I was so nervous to tell my parents I was going to move to England. And they loved Peter, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=644.0s)]
*  but I thought they're going to say this is a bad choice, Dana. Be disappointed [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=648.0s)]
*  in me. I built up the courage and I told them, and you know what they said? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=652.0s)]
*  Amazing! This is so great. We're so happy for you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=656.0s)]
*  So all of that angst was for absolutely nothing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=660.0s)]
*  And it's a big lesson. I worried away so much of my 20s and I wish [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=664.0s)]
*  someone had told me not to or if they did tell me I wish I had listened. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=668.0s)]
*  Because I look back and I think that's the one thing I hope for all young people listening to this. If you are an educated [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=672.0s)]
*  American, then you really only have to decide how hard you want to work because [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=676.0s)]
*  everyone in the world would trade places with you in an instant. And when I [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=680.0s)]
*  look back on my career, my favorite piece of advice that I pass along [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=684.0s)]
*  is that choosing to be loved is not a career limiting decision. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=688.0s)]
*  I think you and Nellie would agree. We would, but I mean, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=692.0s)]
*  that's not a career limiting decision. I mean, you guys took risks and chances and you're building [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=696.0s)]
*  a family, you're building an amazing business. And there are some people who will hesitate. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=700.0s)]
*  And young women that will come to me over the years, there's this one, she was so nervous [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=704.0s)]
*  because her career was so great and she worked in social media at Fox [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=708.0s)]
*  but she was so in love. And she was in love with a guy who was going to be inheriting [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=712.0s)]
*  his dad's real estate business in Wilmington, North Carolina. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=716.0s)]
*  And I said, you can go to him. It will be okay. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=720.0s)]
*  And if it doesn't work out, you can come back. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=724.0s)]
*  And she's there now and mother of three. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=728.0s)]
*  I just gave a piece of advice to someone who is debating to relocate for a job [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=730.0s)]
*  with us, dating someone somewhere else. And I'm like, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=734.0s)]
*  choose the relationship. That is far [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=738.0s)]
*  and away the most important decision of your life if you think it's the one. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=742.0s)]
*  But also I would say this, choosing the relationship does not have to mean [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=746.0s)]
*  the end of your dreams. Of course not. And I don't think I could have done [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=750.0s)]
*  any of this without Peter. I really don't. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=754.0s)]
*  Right. But I think, I don't know if you'll agree with this, but I think maybe you will. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=758.0s)]
*  I think that choice, the choice of the relationship and the who is the single most important decision [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=762.0s)]
*  for life and for everything. For everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=766.0s)]
*  It informs literally everything. I am lucky in that half of my family works here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=770.0s)]
*  So I don't have to think about things like work-life balance. They don't exist for me. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=774.0s)]
*  I live in a borderless land where everything is work and everything is life, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=778.0s)]
*  which would not work for most people. But I do think that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=782.0s)]
*  yeah, the decision to be with someone that wants you to, like, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=786.0s)]
*  I've been in relationships where I felt like the world was shrinking. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=790.0s)]
*  And then I've been in relationships where I feel like everything is like a great unfolding [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=794.0s)]
*  and opening up. And that's sort of always my test for people. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=798.0s)]
*  Like, do you feel like your horizon is expanding or not expanding? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=802.0s)]
*  And keeping your eyes and ears open at all times for opportunities, not just career-wise, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=806.0s)]
*  but also for relationships. I am concerned and I talk about this that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=810.0s)]
*  especially post-COVID, a lot of young people are not getting out there. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=814.0s)]
*  I don't mean just like going to a bar, but like you have to make an investment. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=818.0s)]
*  You have to go out and join a group or be a part of something [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=822.0s)]
*  where you are actually going to meet other humans and really invest [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=826.0s)]
*  in this time. And investing in yourself in your 20s in a relationship [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=830.0s)]
*  or in your early 30s, I think is critically important. It doesn't mean it can't happen later. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=834.0s)]
*  I think it can. But what I find is that when somebody comes and asks me career advice, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=838.0s)]
*  they always have sort of like Matlock at the very end. They're like, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=842.0s)]
*  there's just one more thing. And I'm like, what's that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=846.0s)]
*  How can I meet somebody that I can be with that can give me joy to share [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=850.0s)]
*  this life with? And I say, well, what do you do [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=854.0s)]
*  Friday, Saturday, Sunday? And if they answer that, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=858.0s)]
*  honestly, so many of them are home, computer, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=862.0s)]
*  reality TV. It doesn't work, guys. You have to get out there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=866.0s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean you might meet somebody on a plane, but now with phones [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=870.0s)]
*  and AirPods, I've sat next to plenty of people on a plane I would never want to talk to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=874.0s)]
*  either. But I just mean having your eyes and ears open at all [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=878.0s)]
*  times and then being willing to make that leap is worth it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=882.0s)]
*  Okay, so you go to England, you give up everything, you kind of can't work there. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=886.0s)]
*  Don't have a visa and did not break the law. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=890.0s)]
*  You probably are. You probably like never jaywalk. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=894.0s)]
*  Oh, I definitely jaywalk, but I love both ways three times. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=898.0s)]
*  I want to get to the period when you're press secretary and you're in the White House. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=902.0s)]
*  You joined the Bush administration a little after 9-11. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=906.0s)]
*  Just soon after I went to the Justice Department and I was one of many spokespeople, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=910.0s)]
*  but what a great job, what training that gave me. It was terrific. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=914.0s)]
*  So you're there. And one of the things you write about in the book is [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=918.0s)]
*  you were going to resign from the White House only then [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=922.0s)]
*  in the meeting where you're talking to your colleague. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=926.0s)]
*  He says to you, actually let me go first. We want to offer you [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=930.0s)]
*  the press secretary position. Why were you going to resign and why did you decide [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=934.0s)]
*  to take what was clearly already going to be a very high [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=938.0s)]
*  controversy, very high stress job? So I'd been in the Bush [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=942.0s)]
*  administration for six and a half years at that point. I was a deputy for [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=946.0s)]
*  Scott McClellan and then Tony Snow and there were about 18, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=950.0s)]
*  well maybe a little bit more, maybe 20 months left in the Bush administration. And the chief of staff said, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=954.0s)]
*  look, if you don't have fresh legs in order to finish this [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=958.0s)]
*  out because the president intends to sprint to the finish, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=962.0s)]
*  let us know now. And I remember talking to Peter saying, sprint to the finish. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=966.0s)]
*  I'm barely crawling here. I mean, we were 18, 20 hour days. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=970.0s)]
*  I was a deputy and I loved that job so much. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=974.0s)]
*  But it was pretty clear to me I was not going to become the press secretary and I thought maybe I should [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=978.0s)]
*  leave now, get my life back on track a little bit and get a job [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=982.0s)]
*  because I didn't come from money. I wasn't going to leave the White House and [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=986.0s)]
*  be living off a trust fund. I needed to figure it out. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=990.0s)]
*  And so Peter and I went on a trip where he was [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=994.0s)]
*  doing some crazy hood to coast race. It's like a [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=998.0s)]
*  24-7 race, crazy, or 24 hour race. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1002.0s)]
*  And on the flight back, we made a joint decision that yes, I would leave the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1006.0s)]
*  White House. And he said, oh, I'm going to, she's going to get her life back and [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1010.0s)]
*  I'm going to get my wife back. I mean, 20 hour days. So the next morning, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1014.0s)]
*  I went in, I saw Ed Gillespie and he was head [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1018.0s)]
*  of all comms. And I said, hey, can I see you after the 8.30? He goes, yeah, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1022.0s)]
*  I need to talk to you too. I said, perfect. Okay, great. And I am dreading it because [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1026.0s)]
*  I love George W. Bush. I would do anything to have [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1030.0s)]
*  a heart that was fresh enough to be there for him. And I didn't really want [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1034.0s)]
*  to leave, but I had made this decision with Peter and I thought it was the right thing to do. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1038.0s)]
*  So my mind and my heart were at odds. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1042.0s)]
*  And so comms meeting ends. Ed says, Dana, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1046.0s)]
*  can you stay? So I'm sure people thought I was in trouble for something. So I sit down [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1050.0s)]
*  and I was about to just blurt it out to get it over with, rip the band-aid off. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1054.0s)]
*  And he goes, do you mind if I go first? I said, sure. And so I sat down, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1058.0s)]
*  I looked back and he said, the president would like to name you the press secretary on [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1062.0s)]
*  Friday. And I said, great. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1066.0s)]
*  What do we need to do to get ready? And I knew in that instant [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1070.0s)]
*  my life was going to change dramatically and that it was an opportunity [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1074.0s)]
*  as the first Republican woman press secretary that I would [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1078.0s)]
*  always cherish, be super grateful for, and I would [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1082.0s)]
*  always work to give back. And that's part of the mentoring piece of it all. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1086.0s)]
*  Interestingly, Ed Gillespie didn't know that story until I wrote [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1090.0s)]
*  my first book and he said I had no ideas. I never told [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1094.0s)]
*  anyone. But I remember walking down the stairs of the West Wing, going to my [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1098.0s)]
*  office, closing the little pocket door, tiny office, and I called Peter [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1102.0s)]
*  and he said, how'd it go? And I said, so I'm going to be the press secretary. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1106.0s)]
*  And bless him. He was like, congratulations, my darling. He was so happy. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1110.0s)]
*  And our lives did change quite a lot. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1114.0s)]
*  How did they change? I mean, you've talked about how especially the last six months [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1116.0s)]
*  of it, you couldn't sleep without a pill. I mean, talk about crawling. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1120.0s)]
*  You could barely eat. Your back was... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1124.0s)]
*  I had an eye twitch. I had numbness from this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1128.0s)]
*  elbow to this finger because of the Blackberry use. I could write an entire [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1132.0s)]
*  press release on a Blackberry with no mistakes. I was really good at it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1136.0s)]
*  But I do talk a lot about health and wellness in the book because [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1140.0s)]
*  I don't want the job again. But if I were to go back to be [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1144.0s)]
*  the press secretary, I would prioritize my health because I would be a much [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1148.0s)]
*  better press secretary. And it's the only big advice I give to anyone [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1152.0s)]
*  who is going to be in that job. It's the one thing I really tell them to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1156.0s)]
*  make sure that you are especially eating healthy, drinking enough water. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1160.0s)]
*  I basically existed off of green tea and diet coke. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1164.0s)]
*  And it was like a caffeine situation all the time. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1168.0s)]
*  But I was on top of things. I could handle it all. But if I look back, I think [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1172.0s)]
*  I would have done better if I had been more healthy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1176.0s)]
*  But I mean, the president, it's sort of crazy to think back because [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1180.0s)]
*  it was less than 20 years ago, but it feels like another universe. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1184.0s)]
*  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were going on. The Bush lied, people died [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1188.0s)]
*  thing had already become a meme, although we didn't really talk about memes back then. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1192.0s)]
*  I remember when the Iraqi journalist [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1196.0s)]
*  threw the shoe at Bush and ended up hitting you. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1200.0s)]
*  I got hit by the steel arm of the boom mic and I was the only one who really got hurt [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1204.0s)]
*  except for the guy who threw the shoe. What happened to him? He had a bad day. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1208.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. Suffice it to say, you were [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1212.0s)]
*  walking, you're such a sunny disposition, but you're walking into a political [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1216.0s)]
*  context with, you'll remember the polling numbers, but just the vibes [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1220.0s)]
*  were not... Well, I would say the financial crisis really for me was the one that was just like [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1224.0s)]
*  that was really, really difficult. The wars, the financial crisis, like how did [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1228.0s)]
*  you bear up and what was the hardest thing about it? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1232.0s)]
*  I think a lot of it comes from the top, right? I worked for a leader who [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1236.0s)]
*  obviously was under a ton of pressure, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1240.0s)]
*  but was a leader, decisive, and we were busy and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1244.0s)]
*  we were stressful, but we were joyous. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1248.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, especially when it came to, for example, torture. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1252.0s)]
*  I remember waking up one morning and there was a story in the New York Times [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1256.0s)]
*  about how an operative had burned interrogation [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1260.0s)]
*  tapes. And I thought, oh, there's our lead. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1264.0s)]
*  And I went in and I'll never forget, I won't say who it was, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1268.0s)]
*  wasn't the president, but I came into my office and he said, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1272.0s)]
*  do you have a minute? Right before the briefing. I was like, yes, but I [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1276.0s)]
*  had all my paperwork out and I was like, what am I going to say? And it's legal and thank [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1280.0s)]
*  God I had the DOJ training because I'm like, whoa, there's so much going on. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1284.0s)]
*  And I'll never forget he said, so in the days [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1288.0s)]
*  after 9-11, our president had to make a really [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1292.0s)]
*  tough decision. And it was really tough and we had to ask [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1296.0s)]
*  our men and women to do some very difficult things. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1300.0s)]
*  Really difficult. And I'm just here to [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1304.0s)]
*  tell you, I promise you, it saved lives. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1308.0s)]
*  And I trust this person implicitly and I said, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1312.0s)]
*  I got it. And I went out and I had [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1316.0s)]
*  kind of the easiest briefing I'd ever had. And the reason is because [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1320.0s)]
*  I knew the ultimate decision had been correct. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1324.0s)]
*  And I don't expect people to agree with this end decision, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1328.0s)]
*  but can you respect the decision making process? And can the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1332.0s)]
*  reporters know that I know what the decision making process was [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1336.0s)]
*  and I did. Partly because I made sure, but also because [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1340.0s)]
*  President Bush was happy to have me there with him to be able to watch, learn, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1344.0s)]
*  listen, pay attention. And I knew, and I'll tell you one story that I love [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1348.0s)]
*  that I don't think I tell in the book, at least not in this one. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1352.0s)]
*  There was a morning I woke up and all hell had broken [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1356.0s)]
*  loose in Iraq and Maliki, the prime minister at the time, had sent [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1360.0s)]
*  troops into Basra to help protect the Sunni who were being persecuted by the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1364.0s)]
*  Shia and the British had lost control of the neighborhood. It had been a problem for quite a [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1368.0s)]
*  while. And Maliki overnight sent troops into Basra. And I have all these reporters, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1372.0s)]
*  what's the president comment? What's he say? What's he say? And I'm like, guys, can [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1376.0s)]
*  you just let me wash my hair and I'll be there. Like, give me a second. This is all by email. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1380.0s)]
*  And I remember everybody from CNN sent me an individual email and I [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1384.0s)]
*  remember putting them all on one email and I said, whoever [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1388.0s)]
*  emails me again from CNN is going to make sure that Fox gets this first. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1392.0s)]
*  And then they're like, we're sorry, we're sorry. I'm like, stop sending me emails. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1396.0s)]
*  Fast forward an hour and I [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1400.0s)]
*  just felt so much pressure and I said, look, President Bush stands with Prime Minister Maliki and [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1404.0s)]
*  reminds the world that this is exactly what he said he would never do. But he did it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1408.0s)]
*  And the president supports him. All of a sudden these wire stories [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1412.0s)]
*  start coming out. Betrayus is furious with Maliki. Rice [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1416.0s)]
*  is mad at Maliki. Gates is mad at Maliki. Everybody's mad at Maliki. And I thought, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1420.0s)]
*  I am going to get fired. I did something I usually wouldn't [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1424.0s)]
*  do. I was not cautious enough. I didn't double check. I didn't cross my [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1428.0s)]
*  T's and dot my I's. And I came downstairs and Peter's like, what's wrong? I said, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1432.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to get fired. And we had to leave between 6.02 and 6.08 for me to get to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1436.0s)]
*  the White House on time. So I got there. The national security [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1440.0s)]
*  advisor was not available to see me that morning as he had usually because he was [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1444.0s)]
*  in the situation room dealing with the problem. And I thought, oh my gosh, I'm going to get fired. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1448.0s)]
*  I go into this senior staff meeting. Josh Bolton, chief of staff, late. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1452.0s)]
*  Never happens in the Bush White House. He doesn't then come into the Roosevelt room from [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1456.0s)]
*  his office. He comes from the Oval Office. And I'm like, well, here it comes. I'm going to get fired in front of [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1460.0s)]
*  everybody. And he doesn't sit down and he says, I've just [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1464.0s)]
*  come from the Oval Office and I'm here to tell you, if there's anybody in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1468.0s)]
*  this room who has said that the president doesn't back Prime Minister Maliki, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1472.0s)]
*  they are wrong and correct it. And I had the AP [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1476.0s)]
*  Wire story printed out with me and I said, I said it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1480.0s)]
*  He's on record. He's okay. He can send this to the prime minister because he needed [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1484.0s)]
*  to have that trust with the prime minister. That the prime minister went, yeah, you did a tough thing. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1488.0s)]
*  You did the right thing. You sent your troops in to protect your people. That was the right thing to [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1492.0s)]
*  do. So I didn't get fired. Eighteen months [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1496.0s)]
*  later, we're doing the end of term interviews and President Bush is asked [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1500.0s)]
*  by Charles Krauthammer, sir, when did you know that the surge was going to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1504.0s)]
*  work? And he thinks about it for a second and goes, you know, Charles, that's a great question. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1508.0s)]
*  I'd have to say it's the day that Maliki sent [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1512.0s)]
*  troops into Basra. He goes, and you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1516.0s)]
*  no one in my administration was with me except for Dana. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1520.0s)]
*  And I was like, I cannot believe he remembered [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1524.0s)]
*  that. And that was the kind of bond that he and I had [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1528.0s)]
*  that a lot of press secretaries will have with their presidents. It's pretty [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1532.0s)]
*  unbelievable. Just in that story, to think back to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1536.0s)]
*  the Republican Party as it was [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1540.0s)]
*  when you were working in politics. You're talking about a [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1544.0s)]
*  hawkish president who thought about America as the world's [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1548.0s)]
*  policeman. You're talking about- And initially, right? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1552.0s)]
*  Remember, Ron says the same, we're not going to do that. Okay, but broadly speaking, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1556.0s)]
*  we're not really thinking about pulling back from the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1560.0s)]
*  world. Certainly at the- Well, he ran on that in 2000, yes, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1564.0s)]
*  but then 9-11 happened and it changed his thinking, for sure. Okay. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1568.0s)]
*  Free marketeer. Definitely. Absolutely. Compassionate conservative. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1572.0s)]
*  Free trade. Free trade. Immigration. I mean, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1576.0s)]
*  how did- Education, that was a big one. How did we go [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1580.0s)]
*  from there to here? You know, for me, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1584.0s)]
*  it's very interesting to live through a political realignment. I worked with a lot of people [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1588.0s)]
*  in the Bush White House who had been Democrats in the early [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1592.0s)]
*  part of their careers and then through Reagan became [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1596.0s)]
*  staunch Republicans. And we're kind of living through that now and I watch these younger [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1600.0s)]
*  generations who are now very conservative. But also if you think [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1604.0s)]
*  about during that time, in January 2008 when I left [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1608.0s)]
*  the White House, I did not have a Twitter account or a Facebook account. I mean, it's- [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1612.0s)]
*  Okay, so that has changed so dramatically. Mike McCurry was the press secretary who first [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1616.0s)]
*  let cameras into the briefing room. And do you know what day he did that on? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1620.0s)]
*  It just so happened to be the day that the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1624.0s)]
*  And he always thinks, wow, maybe I shouldn't have let the cameras in. But it was kind of inevitable [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1628.0s)]
*  and the communications has changed so much. And [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1632.0s)]
*  so living through the political realignment is fascinating to me. I look back and [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1636.0s)]
*  remember George W. Bush was the one who said, perhaps maybe we could allow [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1640.0s)]
*  people to take a little bit of their Social Security investment and invest it for themselves. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1644.0s)]
*  I was like, maybe we could maybe do that. And I believe [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1648.0s)]
*  that when that problem does get solved, and it will have to, whatever it looks [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1652.0s)]
*  like, it's going to look a lot like what he suggested in 2005. But the Republican [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1656.0s)]
*  Party was so afraid to talk about Social Security reform at that time [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1660.0s)]
*  that they were so far behind them you couldn't see them. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1664.0s)]
*  And then you have Barack Obama, you have Obamacare, you have the Tea Party, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1668.0s)]
*  and then you have somebody that is an incredible talent [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1672.0s)]
*  who has amassed a huge amount of popularity and power in Donald Trump. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1676.0s)]
*  And I actually believe that Donald Trump's election in [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1680.0s)]
*  2016 was not the aberration, but that Joe Biden [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1684.0s)]
*  winning in 2020 was the aberration. Because of [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1688.0s)]
*  COVID. And that it was going in this direction. I don't [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1692.0s)]
*  know how it turns out in the end, but if you just watch the Democrats flailing, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1696.0s)]
*  the fact that Biden won and then they did the big cover-up, to me, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1700.0s)]
*  the cover-up meaning about Biden's acuity and capabilities, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1704.0s)]
*  they ruined the Democratic Party for possibly a generation. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1708.0s)]
*  One thing that it is, you're talking about Black [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1712.0s)]
*  fairies and how there wasn't really Wikipedia, thinking about the way [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1716.0s)]
*  comms used to work out of official Washington and certainly [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1720.0s)]
*  the White House and the way it works now and what people expect and look for [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1724.0s)]
*  is just totally diametrically opposed. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1728.0s)]
*  Before, your era, polish, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1732.0s)]
*  precision, rehearsed, disciplined. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1736.0s)]
*  Now when we see those things, not all of us, it's boring, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1740.0s)]
*  it seems canned, it seems inauthentic. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1744.0s)]
*  What feels authentic is looking at JD Vance's Twitter or Trump's [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1748.0s)]
*  Truth Social. Do you think that that's here to stay? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1752.0s)]
*  Never going away. I think of it this way. One of my favorite classes in [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1756.0s)]
*  college was the history of journalism and so I just kind of [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1760.0s)]
*  think about this. FDR, he's got the radio [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1764.0s)]
*  and now he can speak directly to you in your ears [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1768.0s)]
*  and that's still a very intimate thing. People like podcasts because they think that [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1772.0s)]
*  they're sitting here having a conversation with us and thankful that they listen. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1776.0s)]
*  He has the radio. JFK sort of figures out TV but Reagan perfects [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1780.0s)]
*  it. I would say that [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1784.0s)]
*  Obama was the first to figure out how to campaign using social media [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1788.0s)]
*  but Donald Trump is the one who figured out how to lead by social media. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1792.0s)]
*  So he figured that out. What comes next? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1796.0s)]
*  We don't know. But in order to talk directly to the American people, that is [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1800.0s)]
*  here to stay. One of the things that I think is [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1804.0s)]
*  pretty astonishing, even for those of us that have [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1808.0s)]
*  gotten used to the way that Trump communicates, is the way that this particular [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1812.0s)]
*  White House under Stephen Chung communicates. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1816.0s)]
*  Thinking about things like the ASMR video of arrested [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1820.0s)]
*  migrants and the sounds of their chains. I'm thinking about this [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1824.0s)]
*  weeping woman, I think she was a fentanyl dealer but waiting to be deported, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1828.0s)]
*  a really kind of horrific image and that getting turned into [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1832.0s)]
*  a Studio Ghibli style chat GPT meme. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1836.0s)]
*  Peter Baker of the New York Times made a comment recently that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1840.0s)]
*  if the images from Abu Ghraib came out today, the White House might have [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1844.0s)]
*  tweeted them approvingly. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1848.0s)]
*  I remember that night watching 60 Minutes when they did [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1852.0s)]
*  the Abu Ghraib report and thinking, I was working on [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1856.0s)]
*  the White House Council on Environmental Quality at the time so I didn't really have any say in the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1860.0s)]
*  comms writ large but I can't imagine that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1864.0s)]
*  Think about Kristi Noem in front of the cells. The prison. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1868.0s)]
*  What do you make of this style? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1872.0s)]
*  I'll put it very neutrally. What do you think of this style of communications [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1876.0s)]
*  that's coming out of this White House? What's behind it? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1880.0s)]
*  Do you think it's persuasive? Do you think it's strategic? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1884.0s)]
*  Is this all just sort of in a way [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1888.0s)]
*  mimetic and imitative of Trump himself? What's going on? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1892.0s)]
*  It is impressive and I do think for [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1896.0s)]
*  many people it is persuasive but it also has the ability to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1900.0s)]
*  be so offensive to people that it will just [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1904.0s)]
*  make them want to like lie down on the ground and cry. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1908.0s)]
*  They are so much better at it [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1912.0s)]
*  than the Biden team ever thought of being. And then [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1916.0s)]
*  sometimes the people who win in technology are the ones who get there first. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1920.0s)]
*  The Free Press is a good example of that. There will be imitations of, you [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1924.0s)]
*  know, from the New York Times to a substack to a company. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1928.0s)]
*  The media is changing so much. I work at a place [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1932.0s)]
*  at Fox where I have this book and I'm like, I could be on Fox [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1936.0s)]
*  Nation. I can be on Fox Business. I'll do Fox News Digital. I'll do Fox News Podcasts. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1940.0s)]
*  All the things that are available to us as communicators. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1944.0s)]
*  But in some ways also there's just very few people all watching the same thing. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1948.0s)]
*  So then we don't have any sort of common ground. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1952.0s)]
*  The White House using those videos, I think that they are [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1956.0s)]
*  they just got there first. And they're good at it. And they're [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1960.0s)]
*  smart about it. I don't know if it's always in the best taste. But I do [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1964.0s)]
*  say it is pretty effective for [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1968.0s)]
*  not only reaffirming for people who support them, but [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1972.0s)]
*  for making sure it drives your enemies crazy. I should say opponents [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1976.0s)]
*  not enemies. Well it's definitely, yeah, I would say it's [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1980.0s)]
*  provocative. It's very, very, very provocative. Do you know Stephen Chung? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1983.0s)]
*  I don't. I don't know him. I hear great things. I hear that he's a very nice and kind [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1987.0s)]
*  person. I have been able to get to know Caroline Lovett a little bit more. What do you think of her? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1991.0s)]
*  I love what my mom said about her. She said, she's a pistol. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1995.0s)]
*  Yeah, she is. At 27, super smart, self-assured. She's more [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=1999.0s)]
*  self-deprecating in person than you might come across. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2003.0s)]
*  I also loved the other day when Peter Navarro [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2007.0s)]
*  and Elon Musk were having their argument on X. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2011.0s)]
*  Peter Rattato. Yes, and she went to the podium, was asked about it, and she goes, well, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2015.0s)]
*  boys will be boys. And she, I believe, has three or four older brothers. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2019.0s)]
*  And I typically will never weigh in on something, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2023.0s)]
*  but I did send her a text like, that's a great line. That was funny. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2027.0s)]
*  And one of the things that she can do is she can be a little softer than Trump. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2031.0s)]
*  And she can bring a little bit of lightness when she wants. And I think that that really [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2035.0s)]
*  helps. Plus, I haven't raised children, and I think that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2039.0s)]
*  having a young mother in that job is very interesting. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2043.0s)]
*  How would you rate how he's done so far? I would say incomplete, but when you look [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2047.0s)]
*  at, again, what they would love to be talking about is the fact that [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2051.0s)]
*  the border is soft. That is a remarkable [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2055.0s)]
*  achievement. So why aren't you just talking about that all day, every day? I think they kind of try. Well, part of the [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2059.0s)]
*  other thing is in the press, right, when all the planes land safely at LaGuardia. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2063.0s)]
*  There's not news. But also, I remember Karine Jean-Pierre would be at the podium [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2067.0s)]
*  saying, the border is closed. And we'd have a split screen with Bill [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2071.0s)]
*  Mollusian at the border, and you have thousands of people just streaming across. It was just like the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2075.0s)]
*  video. So if you put a video right now, a camera, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2079.0s)]
*  at Eagle Pass, Texas, it's a beautiful landscape. There's [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2083.0s)]
*  nobody coming across. So there's not much visual to show. And I don't know how [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2087.0s)]
*  you, they would have to get creative in how to show that visually. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2091.0s)]
*  I think it remains to be seen how [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2095.0s)]
*  this fight over the deportations ends. We're in the middle of it. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2099.0s)]
*  I don't exactly know. The other thing is that [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2103.0s)]
*  prices, high prices, it's still an issue. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2107.0s)]
*  Those were the number one and two, sometimes tied issues in [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2111.0s)]
*  the campaign. Inflation and the border. The border is solved. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2115.0s)]
*  Except for now, we have to figure out a way to deal with the back end of all of that. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2119.0s)]
*  That will come. Prices, I think, will be a little [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2123.0s)]
*  bit different. However, I've started looking. The numbers have gone down a little bit, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2127.0s)]
*  but the people who voted for Trump and support him are giving him [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2131.0s)]
*  some time. And he has built up a lot of capital in his [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2135.0s)]
*  political bank, and he's spending it a little bit now and there, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2139.0s)]
*  now and then. And he believes that it's going to work out in the [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2143.0s)]
*  favor of the economy. I hope that's true. I have [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2147.0s)]
*  remained a skeptic on tariffs. I've said that from the beginning. So I would say [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2151.0s)]
*  incomplete. The first 100 days, to me, is not as important [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2155.0s)]
*  as the second 100 days. That's where it gets harder. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2159.0s)]
*  You're obviously not going to go back and work in the White House. No. As you have made clear. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2163.0s)]
*  Don't want to go back in time. That's for younger people. But how would you advise the Trump [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2167.0s)]
*  administration for getting policy just on communication strategy? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2171.0s)]
*  Here's one thing I would say that's just a practical point. I know that the current [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2175.0s)]
*  administration has very strong feelings about the press. I was saying that sometimes we just [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2179.0s)]
*  hated the press behind the scenes. They hate them openly. And banning the [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2183.0s)]
*  Associated Press and a number of things that happen. Yes. There are things that I wouldn't necessarily do. But here's one [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2187.0s)]
*  practical thing I think that they could do and that I would say publicly on the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2191.0s)]
*  Fiverr. If they call me for my advice privately, Caroline, I will keep that private. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2195.0s)]
*  But this is what I would say. I read a ton. I read it all. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2199.0s)]
*  And I am a little bit surprised. And I think that they are missing many, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2203.0s)]
*  many opportunities by how many articles I read that says the White House [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2207.0s)]
*  didn't return call for comment. And then after the article runs, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2211.0s)]
*  then they trash the publication. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2215.0s)]
*  I just don't think that is necessarily the best way [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2219.0s)]
*  to spend your political capital or your capital with the media. I [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2223.0s)]
*  think that everybody has a job to do here. They have a job to do and the reporters have a job [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2227.0s)]
*  to do. And to be honest, they do well. When somebody in the New York Times [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2231.0s)]
*  can have a story that says this is what the White House says, I go, okay, well that makes sense. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2235.0s)]
*  I think that they would be better served by trying to get into [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2239.0s)]
*  those stories more often than they are right now. We're in a really [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2243.0s)]
*  strange moment where trust in a [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2247.0s)]
*  million ways. But just speaking for the media, where the places [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2251.0s)]
*  that we used to think of as mainstream don't actually represent the American mainstream [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2255.0s)]
*  and they've lost a tremendous amount of trust. Then there's sort of the Wild West [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2259.0s)]
*  world of podcasting, mostly dominated by [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2263.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan as the biggest member of that group. But it's just [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2267.0s)]
*  huge grew in that group. Sure. But like, you know, just [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2271.0s)]
*  the Cambrian explosion of podcasts, subtext, etc. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2275.0s)]
*  And I think one of the most interesting conversations happening there [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2279.0s)]
*  is the question of gatekeeping. Because one of the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2283.0s)]
*  I think big takeaways from COVID or at least media coverage of [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2287.0s)]
*  BLM was the gatekeepers weren't telling us the truth. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2291.0s)]
*  They weren't asking the real questions. And not only were they not asking the real questions [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2295.0s)]
*  and sort of seeing their own curiosity as a liability, they were actively suppressing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2299.0s)]
*  things that went against their own political interests. So how can we ever trust gatekeepers? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2303.0s)]
*  The problem is that in this free sort of Wild West world, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2307.0s)]
*  there's no gatekeeping at all. And so the view of someone [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2311.0s)]
*  who is an out and out conspiracy theorist that doesn't believe the moon landing happened [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2315.0s)]
*  or thinks that vaccines make you gay or whatever [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2319.0s)]
*  is treated often with the same level of seriousness as someone who [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2323.0s)]
*  actually knows something. Do you think that that will inevitably [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2327.0s)]
*  just burn itself out? Like, is there a role for gatekeeping? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2331.0s)]
*  For example, on Fox, you guys don't just, I mean, I'm sure a lot [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2335.0s)]
*  of people that watch MSNBC will say they just have anyone on, including [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2339.0s)]
*  those free press people. But you guys are very particular about [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2343.0s)]
*  the kinds of people I imagine that you decide to have on. How do you think through [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2347.0s)]
*  that theme? How do you think through the question of who to platform or not? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2351.0s)]
*  So on the five, we don't have guests. We just have a roundtable of people who [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2355.0s)]
*  for some reason, this show is the number one show in all of cable. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2359.0s)]
*  And we've been on air for 14 years in Gutfeld and I look at each other and think, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2363.0s)]
*  can you believe this? We never thought that it would be. But for, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2367.0s)]
*  let me just speak for America's newsroom. This is the first big news show [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2371.0s)]
*  every day. I love doing it with Bill Hemmer. He's such a professional [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2375.0s)]
*  and so great at breaking news. Today is the day, unfortunately, we had to do [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2379.0s)]
*  coverage of the Pope passing. And who do you call upon? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2383.0s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan. People pretty much still have faith in Cardinal Dolan [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2387.0s)]
*  for a good reason. So you could find a guest like that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2391.0s)]
*  Sometimes you'll have a panel, right? So you'll say, well, there's two points of view on here. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2395.0s)]
*  Can we have Andy McCarthy and Jonathan Turley on and they can argue it out? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2399.0s)]
*  I think that's often very important. The other thing that we try to do [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2403.0s)]
*  as well is to utilize our contributors. I mean, it takes a lot to become a Fox News [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2407.0s)]
*  contributor. That's a high bar. But once you clear it, it is something that is a big [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2411.0s)]
*  responsibility. So we try to use them as well. And then in addition to that, like I look [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2415.0s)]
*  for other people. For example, this weekend, the Wall Street Journal ran a big [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2419.0s)]
*  piece by Annie Linsky about Biden and the cover-up. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2423.0s)]
*  And Emma Tucker, the editor of Wall Street Journal, she had suggested [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2427.0s)]
*  this piece because Annie Linsky wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2431.0s)]
*  last June, three weeks before the debate between Trump and Biden. She had over [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2435.0s)]
*  40 sources. She was trash for it. By people in the media, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2439.0s)]
*  including Morning Joe, et cetera, and by people [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2443.0s)]
*  at the White House. Andrew Bates said terrible things about her. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2447.0s)]
*  And she was right. And so [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2451.0s)]
*  I was reading that on Saturday and I said, we should give her a chance to come back on. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2455.0s)]
*  And she's so nice. She's not going to say, I told you so. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2459.0s)]
*  But it is a thing where you're thinking, the media [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2463.0s)]
*  also knew that Biden wasn't great. They knew the border wasn't secure. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2467.0s)]
*  They knew that inflation was actually happening. And then they seemed surprised that Trump [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2471.0s)]
*  won. Do you think that this is one of the reasons that Fox [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2475.0s)]
*  is doing it? I mean, I just pulled some stats that's kind of unbelievable. Fox has [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2479.0s)]
*  almost quadruple CNN's viewers and double MSNBC's. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2483.0s)]
*  I think this is the thing that's most surprising. It's dominating viewership among [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2487.0s)]
*  young people, including Democrats. More Democrats [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2491.0s)]
*  watch Fox than MSNBC and CNN combined. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2495.0s)]
*  The number one late night show is Gutfeld's show. Like, what's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2499.0s)]
*  going on here? Because after, you know, and we don't have time to get into Roger Ailes [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2503.0s)]
*  and the harassment and all that, but I think after Roger Ailes left the scene, there was a sense of like, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2507.0s)]
*  he's the genius. How are they going to keep it up after that? And I don't think that there was [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2511.0s)]
*  any idea that Fox could be winning over young people and liberals. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2515.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2519.0s)]
*  I wish I could say, here's the secret sauce and let's bottle it up [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2523.0s)]
*  and let's sell it. But we can't. I would say that, for example, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2527.0s)]
*  yes, Roger Ailes, brilliant at what he did. But who came up [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2531.0s)]
*  with the five? And that was Suzanne Scott. And she's the CEO of Fox News. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2535.0s)]
*  And this is a woman who is the most powerful woman in media by far. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2539.0s)]
*  Asks for no attention, does not raise her hand for a big profile, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2543.0s)]
*  doesn't ask for anything like that. But she's the one who said, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2547.0s)]
*  Shannon Breen, I see a path for her. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2551.0s)]
*  And let's lay this out so she can become the host of [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2555.0s)]
*  Fox News Sunday. Jesse Waters. I think we could put him here. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2559.0s)]
*  Let's put him here and then here. Greg Gutfeld. He and I started together on the five. He had a show called [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2563.0s)]
*  Red Eye. Now he's the number one show, as you said, the number one comedy show [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2567.0s)]
*  at night, often beating some of our own shows. Like, can we just compete against each other now? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2571.0s)]
*  Me, I'm [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2575.0s)]
*  a great example. I was terrible when I first started as a contributor, but I had [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2579.0s)]
*  credibility and I had goals. And once I got over my shyness [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2583.0s)]
*  of being able to be me, then she was like, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2587.0s)]
*  what about this? What about the solo show? What about putting her with Hemmer? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2591.0s)]
*  What about maybe putting her on election night? And I am so blessed [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2595.0s)]
*  with opportunities right now. I would say that [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2599.0s)]
*  I'm actually kind of just surprised that [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2603.0s)]
*  I've been there that long. I've never worked at a place that long. I've been there 15 years. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2607.0s)]
*  And for the first time in my life, I'm not worried about what's next. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2611.0s)]
*  I'm kind of excited about what's next, but I have no idea what that will be. I think our viewers [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2615.0s)]
*  have a lot to do with it. But as you say, we have new viewers. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2619.0s)]
*  Last Fourth of July, I got a tap on my shoulder and it was this group of [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2623.0s)]
*  young, good-looking guys from home from college and they were at this party on the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2627.0s)]
*  beach where we were listening to this band. And they said, hi, could we get a picture [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2631.0s)]
*  with you? I was like, oh, your grandpas are probably fans. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2635.0s)]
*  They're like, we're the fans. And that was different. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2639.0s)]
*  And I thought, wow, something's happening here. And I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it is [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2643.0s)]
*  maybe part of this political realignment. The conventional wisdom, if you talk to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2647.0s)]
*  anyone who does a new media company, and really most people, is cable news is [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2651.0s)]
*  dead. Cable news is dead. You hear it all day long. Are they wrong? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2655.0s)]
*  I think cable news is not dead. I think news is [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2659.0s)]
*  not dead. But the way people get their news is changing rapidly. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2663.0s)]
*  You talk in the book about having a moral code [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2667.0s)]
*  and how that has saved you and can save other people [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2671.0s)]
*  from unnecessary anxiety and drama. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2675.0s)]
*  What is that moral code? Have you had it since you were a little kid? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2679.0s)]
*  Yeah. My family is ranchers. And my grandfather and grandmother [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2683.0s)]
*  had a really big influence on my life. I grew up in the Lutheran church. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2687.0s)]
*  You're right, I'm a rule follower pretty much. But I also just kind of want to do [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2691.0s)]
*  the right thing. I'm probably one of those people who very much cares way too much about what people [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2695.0s)]
*  think about me and I really want people to like me. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2699.0s)]
*  I actually was kind of pretty shocking for when [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2703.0s)]
*  social media started showing that there were some people who didn't. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2707.0s)]
*  What? How dare you? How dare you say this to me, right? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2711.0s)]
*  But a lot of those were bots. And so that was eye-opening. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2715.0s)]
*  But this is what I would say. I find life [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2719.0s)]
*  to be easier if you have a set of principles that you live by [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2723.0s)]
*  and that helps you make decisions. What are yours? Oh, well one of them, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2727.0s)]
*  this is actually not like a moral code, but time management is super important. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2731.0s)]
*  And for example, I will not go to a [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2735.0s)]
*  baby shower. I hate going to baby showers. Love that, Dana. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2739.0s)]
*  It takes all day long. And I got caught in a white lie. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2743.0s)]
*  It was a lie. That I couldn't go to my friend's baby shower. This is when I worked at the White House. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2747.0s)]
*  I said, oh, it's because the president's, you know, I'm not able to come because of this, whatever, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2751.0s)]
*  it was the president. And I got caught. And I was in the green room. Did she confront you? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2755.0s)]
*  Well, she said, well, change the date for you. Oh, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2759.0s)]
*  wow. And I was like, no, I don't want to go. And right at that time, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2763.0s)]
*  President Bush was giving a speech that I'd heard many times before. It was his stump speech. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2767.0s)]
*  And I was in the green room and the sound was pumped in and he was talking about how [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2771.0s)]
*  when you're president, if you have a set of principles, it makes [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2775.0s)]
*  it easier to make decisions. Like, you're either with us or you're against us. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2779.0s)]
*  Pretty simple. So I said, oh, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2783.0s)]
*  I need a principle. I don't go to baby showers. I love that. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2787.0s)]
*  What else is in the moral code? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2791.0s)]
*  I mean, one of them in your book that stuck out to me, it's maybe a tertiary point, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2795.0s)]
*  but you like the idea of tipping people in a restaurant [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2799.0s)]
*  at breakfast, especially 30 percent at least. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2803.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I reread the book this weekend and that [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2807.0s)]
*  I was like, first of all, I thought, wow, it actually turned out pretty good. But I [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2811.0s)]
*  reread that advice. And Peter says he remembers that from our first date, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2815.0s)]
*  first weekend when we were together after we met on the airplane, we went to breakfast [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2819.0s)]
*  and he went to pay. And I said, make sure you double the tip. He said, why? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2823.0s)]
*  I said, well, because waitresses at breakfast, they work just as hard as everyone else. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2827.0s)]
*  And in fact, people are so particular at breakfast the way they like their coffee, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2831.0s)]
*  the way they want their eggs, their toast, isn't it just right? It's not just how their mom made it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2835.0s)]
*  And breakfast is so hard to serve. And the price point is so much lower than [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2839.0s)]
*  at dinner that you always should do double the tip or at least [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2843.0s)]
*  do 30 percent. And I thought, I noticed it yesterday too and I thought, oh, I'm glad I put that in there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2847.0s)]
*  I thought that was really, I mean, I just know that when I've been around [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2851.0s)]
*  people that tip really generously, it's like something that has always [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2855.0s)]
*  stuck with me. But you also used to wait tables and that was sort of like [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2859.0s)]
*  best job. A critical part of it. Best job. I loved it. Okay. You talk in the book [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2863.0s)]
*  also about knowing when it's time to leave a job. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2867.0s)]
*  I have my own experience with that. What advice would you give people that are [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2871.0s)]
*  listening about how to know when is the right time to go? So that's interesting because I [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2875.0s)]
*  I left a job because [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2879.0s)]
*  I chose love. That was my first time doing that. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2883.0s)]
*  I left a job because of 9-11. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2887.0s)]
*  So that was a forced event. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2891.0s)]
*  I then left a job because the administration ended. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2895.0s)]
*  And I've been at Fox ever since. I'm not a great person [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2899.0s)]
*  to ask. So what I did in this book is I asked people that I knew [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2903.0s)]
*  and trusted that had done something like that. And Trey Gowdy is a colleague [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2907.0s)]
*  of mine who had been a prosecutor, been a congressman, and he decided [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2911.0s)]
*  to leave the leadership track in Congress. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2915.0s)]
*  And I wanted to ask him, how did you know [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2919.0s)]
*  that it was time? I think his book, Start, Stay, or Leave, is one of the best books of decision [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2923.0s)]
*  making I've ever read. It's excellent. So I wanted to ask him about that because [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2927.0s)]
*  it's really important. And another friend of mine, Michelle Chase, who is in the book, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2931.0s)]
*  I asked her how do you know? And she reminded me of a story [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2935.0s)]
*  that I learned, which is a girlfriend had an opportunity to go someplace else [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2939.0s)]
*  but she was very happy in her job, very comfortable in her job. So she went to ask her girlfriend, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2943.0s)]
*  what do you think about this new opportunity? I don't want to go work there. My job's so easy right now. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2947.0s)]
*  She said, do you feel like you're nearly drowning every day? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2951.0s)]
*  He goes, of course not. The job's uncomfortable. She goes, oh, then you have to leave. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2955.0s)]
*  Because it's too easy. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2959.0s)]
*  There's a time in your life for easy. But I also think that [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2963.0s)]
*  the other piece of advice I love in here is the idea that work-life balance is something [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2967.0s)]
*  that we all strive for. But you can't necessarily think of work-life balance [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2971.0s)]
*  every single day. Sometimes there's a season in your life. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2975.0s)]
*  You're in the season of 18 hour days, 20 hour days, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2979.0s)]
*  you wake up at 2 o'clock in the morning, you're sending texts to Sean. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2983.0s)]
*  But that is not going to be for the rest of your life. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2987.0s)]
*  Because you're making an investment. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2991.0s)]
*  It won't be. Because you guys will get established and you'll figure it out. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2995.0s)]
*  And then you'll realize, what can I outsource? What can I let go of? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=2999.0s)]
*  The hardest thing, and I have this hard time too, is I love everything I do. I love these opportunities. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3003.0s)]
*  I would buy everybody's minutes if I could. It's how do you know [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3007.0s)]
*  when it's okay to say enough? And I think that [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3011.0s)]
*  Jill and Joe Biden made a terrible choice. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3015.0s)]
*  They should have known when to leave. And I think the Democratic Party, we talk about [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3019.0s)]
*  a Republican realignment, the Democrats are in the middle of it right now too. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3023.0s)]
*  And big time, generationally. But it's not clear where they're going to... Have no idea. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3027.0s)]
*  And how they're going to exit the wilderness. With the Republicans, we know [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3031.0s)]
*  what it looks like. What that will look like post-Trump, I think, is a question. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3035.0s)]
*  Dana, one of the things in this book, advice that I know [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3039.0s)]
*  I will never follow, is that you tell people to get a hobby [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3043.0s)]
*  and help with work-life balance. No way. I mean, we know that Bush and Churchill [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3047.0s)]
*  were both painters. Why is this good advice for a person working [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3051.0s)]
*  18 to 20 hour days? I should probably go back and amend. And in the paperback [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3055.0s)]
*  maybe I will. I don't think you should have a hobby right now. Like I literally [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3059.0s)]
*  lie when people ask me what our hobbies are. Like to live in this rental... [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3063.0s)]
*  You're raising children. But like we're living in this rental and it's one of these buildings where you... [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3067.0s)]
*  Like they interview you. It's insane. And they were like, what do you guys do? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3071.0s)]
*  They were like, what have your years been like in California? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3075.0s)]
*  Literally Nellie just launches into lying about how we love going to the beach [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3079.0s)]
*  and we go hiking. I'm like, we've been on... We don't do [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3083.0s)]
*  anything other than the company and kids. But maybe I'll get a hobby later [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3087.0s)]
*  in life. But tell me why the hobby is important. Well, it's interesting. You mentioned Churchill and Bush [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3091.0s)]
*  and painting. But that was in retirement. Right. Okay. Yes. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3095.0s)]
*  So one of the things Bush... Bush was not painting while in the White House. No. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3099.0s)]
*  Bush never picked up a paintbrush, but he read a book that Winston Churchill had written [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3103.0s)]
*  about retirement in which Churchill said, you have to have three hobbies [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3107.0s)]
*  and for it to be an actual hobby, you have to take the lessons [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3111.0s)]
*  and you have to actually be doing the practice [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3115.0s)]
*  and fulfilling it. One of Churchill's was painting. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3119.0s)]
*  And President Bush thought, well, maybe I can do that. Turns out [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3123.0s)]
*  he's excellent. He took a lot of lessons, three or four [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3127.0s)]
*  days a week, painted every... Paints every day. Now he's painting books. He has [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3131.0s)]
*  huge murals. It's unbelievable. He's so good at it. And so [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3135.0s)]
*  I do think that especially for me at this time when I have a really [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3139.0s)]
*  different kind of day where I do a morning show and a late afternoon evening show [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3143.0s)]
*  that I have this time in the middle of the day that I have to figure out a way [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3147.0s)]
*  to have some sort of thing that is a different muscle to exercise. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3151.0s)]
*  That could be in my brain, right, if I were to take music lessons [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3155.0s)]
*  or something. But for me, movement is really important. I can get [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3159.0s)]
*  really tense and stiff and tight and I think I don't [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3163.0s)]
*  want to be that way. I'd like to stay as flexible as possible. So [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3167.0s)]
*  finding a way to put my phone down for an hour or 90 minutes at a time [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3171.0s)]
*  and then get back on 20 minutes, check emails, send a note, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3175.0s)]
*  do that and then walk back to Fox listening to [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3179.0s)]
*  commentary magazine. Honestly, I listen to your podcast [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3183.0s)]
*  honestly. Maybe it's three martini lunch, maybe [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3187.0s)]
*  it's dancing or call me back. I'm trying to listen all the time and always be learning. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3191.0s)]
*  ABL, that's my sort of rule. How can I be maximizing this time? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3195.0s)]
*  And then on the weekends I can have more fun. Another piece of advice [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3199.0s)]
*  you give in this book is take all the vacation days you can. Help [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3203.0s)]
*  me. Tell me about that. I'm not a great example of this. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3207.0s)]
*  But you know who encourages us to do that at Fox is the CEO [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3211.0s)]
*  I mentioned, Suzanne Scott. I remember the day of the Uvalde shooting. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3215.0s)]
*  I was on a plane getting ready to leave for a significant [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3219.0s)]
*  birthday. I was going to Spain and I was like, oh my [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3223.0s)]
*  gosh, should I get off? I think there's a big news. Should I go? And I got a note from her. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3227.0s)]
*  I hadn't sent one to her but she sent one to me. She goes, I know what you're thinking right now. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3231.0s)]
*  And there will always be news. You have to go and refresh [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3235.0s)]
*  and come back and we'll use every bit of you when you're back but you have to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3239.0s)]
*  go have a good time right now. Wow. You seem to have a kind of [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3243.0s)]
*  very powerful internal engine that just [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3247.0s)]
*  gives you the ability to just go harder than most people. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3251.0s)]
*  I don't want to say I'm a fatalist but I've become much more of a [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3255.0s)]
*  people like have just these inborn engines [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3259.0s)]
*  or they don't. They have an inborn curiosity or they don't. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3263.0s)]
*  They have, you know, I'm married to someone with like a very high happiness set point. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3267.0s)]
*  I don't have that. I'm much more up and down. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3271.0s)]
*  How much of the kinds of advice you're giving do you feel is actionable? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3275.0s)]
*  You know, this voraciousness that you're expressing, like always be learning. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3279.0s)]
*  It's like, I feel that way. That is a thing that I feel I was lucky [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3283.0s)]
*  to be born with. But was that nature? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3287.0s)]
*  Was that my parents? I don't know but it wasn't something that had to be taught. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3291.0s)]
*  How much of the advice you're giving to people do you think is learnable? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3295.0s)]
*  That is such a great question because I was just thinking about my sister [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3299.0s)]
*  who's younger than me, my biggest fan ever. I remember when [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3303.0s)]
*  I learned to read, she was four years younger, I learned to read and she told everybody [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3307.0s)]
*  my sister can read. And even to this day [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3311.0s)]
*  she wants nothing to do with the press. She doesn't want to be, there's no [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3315.0s)]
*  traveling the world. There's no like, oh I'm going to be this, I'm [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3319.0s)]
*  going to do that, I'm going to write that book and then after I do that one I'm going to do this and I'm going to try this. I'm going to be [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3323.0s)]
*  happy. None of that. And she is one of the happiest people I've ever known in my life. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3327.0s)]
*  Do you think there's an inherent tension between ambition [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3331.0s)]
*  and happiness? No. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3335.0s)]
*  I would say when I'm not happy is when I'm [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3339.0s)]
*  when I feel stuck or if I'm in a cul-de-sac. And my mom [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3343.0s)]
*  used to say, a bored Dana is not a happy Dana. And I don't know but it's like [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3347.0s)]
*  to parent somebody like that. I've had children, maybe as your children grow up you'll find [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3351.0s)]
*  oh okay this is what she wants to do. Okay. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3355.0s)]
*  This is what I would say. For the young people that are [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3359.0s)]
*  coming to me for advice, it is learnable. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3363.0s)]
*  And actionable. Because they even know to ask for advice. Exactly. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3367.0s)]
*  And I find, one of the reasons I wrote this and the other books is because [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3371.0s)]
*  there is a supply and demand problem. It's out of balance when it comes [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3375.0s)]
*  to the appetite for guidance and advice from [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3379.0s)]
*  especially young people. But now the young people that used to come to me are now [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3383.0s)]
*  executives, managers, are becoming parents. So now their [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3387.0s)]
*  questions are different which is why I said let me ask some other people here what they think [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3391.0s)]
*  about this. Okay. Dana Perino. Are you ready for a lightning round? Yes. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3395.0s)]
*  I love lightning rounds. Okay. You ready? I will do it appropriately. Okay. Not worried [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3399.0s)]
*  about that. Your book is called I Wish Someone Had Told Me. What is the number [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3403.0s)]
*  one thing you wish someone had told you earlier? Not to worry away my 20s. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3407.0s)]
*  What is the best piece of advice that George Shubu Bush ever gave you? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3411.0s)]
*  To ask myself when I'm considering an issue [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3415.0s)]
*  or a decision what is the worst thing that could happen. And when you think it [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3419.0s)]
*  through it's usually not that bad. What do you consider your biggest accomplishment? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3423.0s)]
*  My marriage. When you meet [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3427.0s)]
*  younger people who are considering dating someone with an age [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3431.0s)]
*  gap, what do you tell them? Don't worry about what other people think because it almost [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3435.0s)]
*  derailed my relationship with Peter. Is it [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3439.0s)]
*  true you would flip off reporters that you didn't like under the podium? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3443.0s)]
*  I would, yeah, especially if they were asking me a question that was annoying. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3447.0s)]
*  Like you would literally go like this? I would hold the cup like this under the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3451.0s)]
*  podium and then I would just go like that. But they couldn't [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3455.0s)]
*  see me. But did it psychically help you? Yeah. Yeah. Gave me power. When's the last time you [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3459.0s)]
*  talked to George W. Bush? A month ago. Do you think that he should be [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3463.0s)]
*  speaking out more in this political moment? No. No, because he never wanted to. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3467.0s)]
*  I remember when we did the interviews on the way out and I'd say, oh sir, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3471.0s)]
*  you know, Barry's going to ask you what you think your legacy will be. And I remember he would say, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3475.0s)]
*  I can't think about it. I don't know. Last year I read three books about [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3479.0s)]
*  George Washington and if they're still trying to figure out the first president then the 43rd [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3483.0s)]
*  doesn't have a lot to worry about because he'll never know. He did not want the Kleeg lights [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3487.0s)]
*  afterwards and I think it would not be authentic to him if he were to come out [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3491.0s)]
*  and speak right now. He just, it's just not in his nature. He doesn't want to do it. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3495.0s)]
*  Describe the late Roger Ailes in three words. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3499.0s)]
*  Bigger than life. Perfect. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3503.0s)]
*  Is it true that he used to call the five the ten because he always had someone to replace you guys [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3507.0s)]
*  with? I've never heard that. Okay, I heard that. Is it not true? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3511.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I've never heard that. But I always, I mean, to this [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3515.0s)]
*  day, to this moment, I always feel replaceable at any moment. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3519.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good way to feel because it makes you be better. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3523.0s)]
*  Okay, Dana, one of the things I can't imagine about your life is the wake up time. What time do you get up in the morning? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3527.0s)]
*  445. What is your morning routine? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3531.0s)]
*  I wake up, I pray, and then I sit up [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3535.0s)]
*  and I start reading the news. Now I usually do a lot of prep [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3539.0s)]
*  the night before. So mostly what I'm looking for in those next 15 minutes is [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3543.0s)]
*  what is different, what is new, and what do I need to ask to be printed [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3547.0s)]
*  for the preparation. Or maybe it's something like I really want to read this [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3551.0s)]
*  but it doesn't have anything to do with the show. I can read it later. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3555.0s)]
*  But I'll print those. I don't print everything. And I send those to my assistant. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3559.0s)]
*  And then I do some sort of movement. I have a Peloton at home. So I either [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3563.0s)]
*  do some Peloton, some weights, some yoga, and then quick shower, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3567.0s)]
*  and then of course I don't have to do my own hair and makeup. So that saves time. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3571.0s)]
*  And then there's a phone call at 645 where Hemmer [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3575.0s)]
*  and our executive producer, we all get on the phone [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3579.0s)]
*  and go through newsroom. And then I leave the house [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3583.0s)]
*  at 705, 710. I'm at the office by 720. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3587.0s)]
*  And hair and makeup at 8. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3591.0s)]
*  Are you exhausted by the time it's like 7pm? How do you do this? And are you naturally a morning person? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3595.0s)]
*  Naturally a morning person for sure. I would love to do anything in the morning. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3599.0s)]
*  I wake up happy. I wake up ready to go. I have a hundred. You know what? My dog wakes up [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3603.0s)]
*  happy too. I'm always like, yes, Percy, yes, the morning is going to be great. Peter's a little bit [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3607.0s)]
*  more slow to roll. What time do you go to sleep? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3611.0s)]
*  I make myself go to the bedroom at 9pm. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3615.0s)]
*  My goal is to be asleep between 930 and 945. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3619.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. But I try not to look at my phone after 9pm. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3623.0s)]
*  Data, people have encouraged you to run for office because they think you'd be great at it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3627.0s)]
*  And because you have a big following, do you agree with them that you'd be great at it? I think I'd be terrible. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3631.0s)]
*  Why? I believe, as Condi Rice told me, this was the best advice [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3635.0s)]
*  I ever got, or best description I ever got. She was on a campaign [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3639.0s)]
*  trail with George W. Bush in 2004 because she was the National Security Advisor. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3643.0s)]
*  And she said it was amazing. They'd have their first meeting at 630. That was [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3647.0s)]
*  the briefing. And the President was ready to go. And then he'd go to this meeting in the town hall. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3651.0s)]
*  And then he'd have a debate. Then he'd have an interview. Then they'd have a dinner, a fundraiser, a rally. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3655.0s)]
*  And then they'd have the end of day meeting at 9 o'clock. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3659.0s)]
*  And President Bush was like, yeah, let's go. And it fed him. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3663.0s)]
*  And she was exhausted. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3667.0s)]
*  And I'm more in that category. Not exhausted, but... Is it the code switching [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3671.0s)]
*  that you're asking your brain to do? Is that the exhausting part? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3675.0s)]
*  I think it's the... [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3679.0s)]
*  I think it's the interaction with people. It's not that I'm not an extrovert, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3683.0s)]
*  because I obviously think that I am, but I do like to be quiet. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3687.0s)]
*  I'm not afraid to think. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3691.0s)]
*  What is the best non-Fox News show, in your view? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3695.0s)]
*  Since I was a little kid, and I was so afraid to go outside and play on Sunday night, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3699.0s)]
*  if I was going to miss 60 minutes. And to this day, when I hear that [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3703.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, it's time to go. It's 60 minutes. Now, Gutfeld says [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3707.0s)]
*  that was the worst sound ever. It meant school was the next day. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3711.0s)]
*  But I loved it. And to this day, I will watch it. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3715.0s)]
*  I will watch it twice the next day. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3719.0s)]
*  How many hours a day do you spend on ex, formerly known as Twitter? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3723.0s)]
*  Not as much as I used to. I don't find it as useful as it was from a newsgathering perspective. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3727.0s)]
*  Post-Elon. I find that. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3731.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think a lot of people left it. And I think the algorithm for me is a little bit off. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3735.0s)]
*  I have different categories that help me. But it is the thing I am on the most [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3739.0s)]
*  for newsgathering, but I don't find it as helpful as it used to be. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3743.0s)]
*  At the moment, we've referenced that a little bit in this conversation. If you had to make a bet [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3747.0s)]
*  on who is going to be the candidate in 2028, who would it be? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3751.0s)]
*  It will be a governor. I don't know which one. I don't think it will be Newsom. And it probably won't be Shapiro. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3755.0s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump is going to try and go for a third term? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3759.0s)]
*  No. Do you think JD Vance will be the nominee? I think that is a strong [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3763.0s)]
*  possibility, but I also think that politics has a way of surprising. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3767.0s)]
*  So I'm not positive, but I would say 65% likely. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3771.0s)]
*  One of the things that Roger Ailes was known for talking about is how [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3775.0s)]
*  the media, I'm going to butcher it, obviously. I'm sure he said it in a very concise and funny way. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3779.0s)]
*  But that the media in America is center-left, left. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3783.0s)]
*  But Americans are, America is a center-right country. That's right. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3787.0s)]
*  Do you think that's why Fox is thriving right now? That there's sort of an alignment between [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3791.0s)]
*  where Americans actually are and what they're choosing to watch? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3795.0s)]
*  Yes. And I think that Donald Trump has captured the word [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3799.0s)]
*  common sense. And that's where the most, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3803.0s)]
*  that's where most people are. And it's brilliant, the use of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3807.0s)]
*  that word. He didn't really use it too much on the campaign trail. He used it a lot in the first 100 [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3811.0s)]
*  days. And I bet you continue to see it because it is [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3815.0s)]
*  corralling most people into the majority. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3819.0s)]
*  We're talking the day after the Pope has died. And one of the questions I always [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3823.0s)]
*  love to ask people in these is, and you've mentioned prayer, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3827.0s)]
*  do you believe in God? I know that that's a yes for you. So I'll ask you, what is [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3831.0s)]
*  your favorite Bible verse or character and why? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3835.0s)]
*  Well, I love the serenity prayer, which is [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3839.0s)]
*  God grant me the wisdom to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3843.0s)]
*  change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. It is very freeing. It gives you a [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3847.0s)]
*  chance to realize, okay, what's in my control? What is not? Can I [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3851.0s)]
*  let that go? And my goal in life, and part of the reason I [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3855.0s)]
*  wrote this is for people [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3859.0s)]
*  to reach that moment of serenity where they're like, okay, everything is just as it's supposed [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3863.0s)]
*  to be in this moment. Those are rare glimpses that you get little moments [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3867.0s)]
*  of your life. You probably remember them when they happen because they're so profound. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3871.0s)]
*  And I think that's what God wants us to be able to glimpse for the future, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3875.0s)]
*  for the afterlife. Dana Perino, thank you so much. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3879.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3883.0s)]
*  . [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v084Wb1D9uE&t=3889.0s)]
