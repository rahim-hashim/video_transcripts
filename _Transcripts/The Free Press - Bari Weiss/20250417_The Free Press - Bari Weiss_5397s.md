If you look closely, you can argue that we’re starting to see the beginnings of a religious revival. Or at least, people (including young people) seriously reconsidering religion.

Now, even if they don’t believe in God, they think that the practice of religion, like keeping Shabbat or going to church every Sunday, has clear benefits—community, a moral code to teach their kids, a rhythm of life. Religion, in other words, is a good program.

But our guest today, the brilliant Ross Douthat, has a different perspective. Ross makes the case that we should be more religious, not in order to cure society’s ills, but because it is true. Because it’s the best or most accurate way to understand the world around us. Belief in God, he says, doesn’t require a leap of faith. In fact, he says, it is entirely rational.

Ross is a best-selling author, a columnist at The New York Times, and the host of a new podcast called Interesting Times. His latest book, which we talk about today, is called Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious. The release is perfectly timed to this strange moment of “plagues, populism, psychedelic encounters, and AI voices in the air,” as Ross writes. He argues that in our age of loneliness and hunger for spirituality and meaning, it’s not enough to simply argue that religion is good. We need to be religious to sustain Western civilization. He argues that it’s time for people to actually become religious.

# Why It’s Logical to Believe in God, with Ross Douthat
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. You may have noticed on this show that I'm always asking guests, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  do you believe in God? What's your favorite biblical character? Or simply, do we need a religious revival? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And you might be wondering, why do I keep knocking on this door? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=12.08s)]
*  Partly it's just because I'm curious about people's metaphysical beliefs and how that affects the rest of their lives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=15.68s)]
*  But also it's because I am of the view that something profound has gotten lost in our society as we've lost traditional religion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=22.56s)]
*  And I'm not alone in thinking that. Indeed, I think if you look closely, you can argue that we're starting to see the beginnings of a religious revival, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=31.08s)]
*  or at least people, including young people, seriously reconsidering religion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, even if they don't believe in God, and a lot of these people don't, they think that the practice of religion, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=45.32s)]
*  of keeping Shabbat Sey or going to church every Sunday, has all kinds of clear benefits. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=51.12s)]
*  The benefits of community, of offering a good moral code to teach their kids, of having a good rhythm of life. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Religion, in other words, it's a good program. But my guest today, the brilliant Ross Douthit, has a different perspective. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=63.6s)]
*  Ross makes the case that we should be more religious not in order to cure society's ills, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  but because it is true, because it is the best way or the most accurate way to understand the world around us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=76.56s)]
*  Belief in God, he says, doesn't require a leap in faith. In fact, he says, it's entirely rational. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=84.4s)]
*  Ross is a bestselling author, a columnist at the New York Times, and the host there of a new podcast called Interesting Times. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=91.92s)]
*  His latest book, which we talk about today, is called Believe, Why Everyone Should Be Religious. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=100.36s)]
*  The release is perfectly timed to this strange moment of plagues, populism, psychedelic encounters, and AI voices in the air, as Ross writes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=106.52s)]
*  Ross argues that in our age of loneliness and hunger for spirituality and meaning, it's not enough to simply argue that religion is a good [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  and we need to be religious to sustain Western civilization. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  He argues that it's time for people to actually become religious. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=131.2s)]
*  I press him hard about that distinction in this interview. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=136.16s)]
*  And right before Easter, as billions of Christians get ready to celebrate the miracle, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=140.04s)]
*  I'm wondering if this return that Ross suggests is even possible and if it is, if it will fix our many, many problems. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=145.28s)]
*  Today on Honestly, I sit down with Ross to understand why he thinks belief in God is the most logical way to understand our world, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=153.04s)]
*  how he rationalizes his faith and how he thinks listeners, even those who don't think of themselves as particularly religious, can come to be believers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=160.48s)]
*  It's an amazing conversation. Stay with us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=171.44s)]
*  Ross Douthat, welcome to Honestly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=179.48s)]
*  Barry Weiss, thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=181.72s)]
*  I'm so excited you're here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=183.88s)]
*  Well, Ross, you have spent the last decade and a half writing about religion and conservative politics and also sometimes movies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=185.52s)]
*  We love your movie reviews. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=194.96s)]
*  For the New York Times, New York Times audiences overwhelmingly right-wing and conservative. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=196.92s)]
*  No, the New York Times audience being overwhelmingly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=201.56s)]
*  I've won so many converts, Barry, that people have been stunned at the current demographic breakdown. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=205.04s)]
*  Everyone is an Opus Dei member that opens it on the Upper West Side now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=210.84s)]
*  But of course, the audience that you're generally writing for is skeptical of religion and you're sort of I don't want to call you a token, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  but you have a sort of like a fish out of water vibe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm a representative. I represent a worldview that not all of my readers share. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  OK, I want you to characterize the worldview of your readers because I think the worldview of your readers is representative of where the sort of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=235.0s)]
*  I hate using this word, but the elite intellectual leadership class in America has been for the entirety of my lifetime. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=246.48s)]
*  And we'll get into this conversation about whether or not that's changing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=255.4s)]
*  But if you could characterize for us the state, not of your worldview, which we'll get to, but of theirs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=258.56s)]
*  How do they see religion? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=264.84s)]
*  I mean, I think so. I'll be talking here about what we call secular liberals. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=266.79999999999995s)]
*  Right. Obviously, the New York Times has many religious readers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  It has religious conservatives, religious liberals and so on. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=275.96s)]
*  But the secular liberal category is what you're talking about. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=279.4s)]
*  And I think that category has always been divided into two broad groups, one that is intensely hostile to religion [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=282.4s)]
*  in a kind of mixture of a sort of new atheist Christopher Hitchens mode with a sort of lapsed religious. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=293.12s)]
*  We had I had a narrow escape from oppression perspective. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  People who were brought up religious left it behind and don't remember it fondly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=305.48s)]
*  And then alongside that hostile group, there is a group that is what you might call the regretful unbelievers, people who like religion to some degree. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=309.64s)]
*  They like religious art. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=321.16s)]
*  You know, they they like the idea of a moral perspective on the world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=322.68s)]
*  They like the I have a dream speech. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=327.04s)]
*  You know, they they appreciate what religion is trying to do in the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  But they think to themselves that, unfortunately, regrettably, a rational, serious, modern person either can't believe or could only come to believe through some kind of, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, leap into unreason where you sort of leave all doubts behind, but also leave reason itself behind. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  And what I'd say about the change is that over the last 15 years, I would say the in the first period when I was at the Times, the more hostile anti-religious reader was more predominant. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=355.08s)]
*  And in the last five years, especially, I would say the the balance has shifted toward regretful unbelief, leavened maybe even with a little more curiosity than before about religion. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=368.36s)]
*  I think I think basically there's a real sense in the kind of secular liberal intelligentsia that the promises that the new atheists made right that, you know, oh, if we only get rid of belief in a sky daddy, a flying spaghetti monster, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=380.76s)]
*  and just, you know, just embrace science and reason, then politics will be more serious and rational. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=397.24s)]
*  You know, everyone will believe in science and trust science. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=404.0s)]
*  Right. That was that was promised. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=407.04s)]
*  Polarization will go away. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=408.8s)]
*  You won't have, you know, crazy fundamentalist or paranoid ideas. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=410.32s)]
*  And clearly, you know, none of that has come to pass. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=414.6s)]
*  A less religious America and we have become less religious in certain ways is a, if anything, a more polarized, more superstitious, more paranoid America where people are just generally more hostile to one another. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  That's, I think, a really notable fact that as America has become more secularized or more post-Christian, Democrats and Republicans sort of regard each other the way Catholics and Protestants did at the worst moments of the wars of religion. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  Right. Where you just can't. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=447.8s)]
*  It's not just you don't want your child marrying a member of the other faith. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=449.47999999999996s)]
*  You can't imagine how a decent person could possibly believe in Trumpism or in woke progressivism and so on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=453.36s)]
*  And so all of that, I think, has prompted, again, this kind of limited partial reconsideration of religion. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=462.2s)]
*  How did this become a reality? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=469.12s)]
*  If we go back to, you know, the time we're about the same age when our let's go back to sort of just like the postwar years, the 1950s, like this was not the baseline state of affairs. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=471.56s)]
*  I'm asking you the impossible, which is basically tell the story of the past 75 years or half century. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  But broadly, how did this become the reality among the liberal intelligentsia? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=492.96s)]
*  How did this become the sort of the waters that most people are swimming in? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=499.24s)]
*  I mean, I think to explain the intelligentsia's trajectory in a way, you go back all the way back to the 19th century and you say there is for for extremely well educated Americans, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=505.0s)]
*  there has been a hundred and fifty year trend away from specifically Protestant, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=519.4000000000001s)]
*  Because the American upper class was very Protestant in the 19th century, specifically Protestant Christianity and toward a political liberalism that retains elements of Protestantism, certain moral ideas. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=526.72s)]
*  You know, the social gospel of the 19th century obviously lives on in contemporary progressive politics. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  It still inhabits the same Protestant institutions. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=547.4s)]
*  They're just not Protestant anymore. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=549.92s)]
*  All the Ivy League schools originally were, you know, nice, nice Protestant Christian institutions. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=551.64s)]
*  If you walk around Harvard, you can still see that the original motto was not just Veritas. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=557.92s)]
*  It was something like Veritas Pro Christe at Ecclesia for Christ and his church. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=564.0s)]
*  So essentially you had a Protestant elite that became by the middle of the 20th century, a liberal Protestant elite with a more attenuated connection to religion. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=569.2s)]
*  And then you have sort of two shocks, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=578.88s)]
*  The first shock is the social revolutions of the 1960s, where I mean, the sexual revolution is the most important part. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=581.36s)]
*  It's not the only part, but it creates this real tension between sort of how normal upper middle class Americans think about their everyday lives and what traditional religion teaches. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=589.7199999999999s)]
*  So prior to the 60s, even if you weren't a really intense Christian, you still thought, well, divorce is bad. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  Premarital sex should be discouraged. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  Abortion is probably wrong. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=612.4799999999999s)]
*  And those attitudes as sort of conventions go away in the 60s and 70s. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=614.56s)]
*  And suddenly Christian teaching on sex becomes much weirder. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=619.56s)]
*  It's seen as patriarchal, misogynist, eventually homophobic, oppressive and so on. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=623.4s)]
*  And that, joined to other socioeconomic forces, gives you one step down where the old mainline Protestant churches sort of collapse. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=628.84s)]
*  Liberal Protestantism just gives way to liberalism. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  And what's left is Catholicism, the faith of immigrants, and evangelicalism, the faith of the South and the Bible Belt. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=639.72s)]
*  And that then becomes the basis for the Christian right and for the culture wars that you and I did both grow up with, right? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you get a second shock in the early 21st century, where those traditions in different ways enter into crisis. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  Catholicism has the sex abuse crisis. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=665.04s)]
*  And I think both face, I think the Internet plays a big role. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  I think both face sort of new versions of atheist arguments. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=672.88s)]
*  The atheist arguments have been around a long time, but suddenly if you're a kid in the first decade of the 21st century and you're in your church group, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  you're hearing arguments online that your youth pastor is just not prepared to handle. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=686.28s)]
*  He's not equipped to deal with Dawkins, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=692.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly with Hitchens, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=694.32s)]
*  And then add into that, there's a general distrust of institutions goes up in American life. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  Religion is not the only institution that goes into decline. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  But I could throw in more forces, but that's the simplest way to see it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=709.08s)]
*  There's a shock in the 60s and 70s, a second shock in the early 21st century. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=712.2s)]
*  And at the elite level, it's this gradual transition from Protestant to liberal Protestant to just plain secular liberal. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=717.16s)]
*  There seems to be a connection between and tell me if you see it differently. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=724.92s)]
*  If you look at those two main moments, right, the advent of the pill, incredible technological scientific progress, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=730.48s)]
*  and then the advent of the Internet and technology, which is upended. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=737.04s)]
*  I think we're just beginning to see what it's upended. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=741.64s)]
*  It's only just starting. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=743.6s)]
*  We haven't even lived in this age that Tyler Cowen is telling me is going to be my future in the next two years [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=745.64s)]
*  and that my children are actually going to be raised by a teddy bears. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=751.48s)]
*  A lot to look forward to. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=754.6s)]
*  But is there a connection, Ross, between technological and scientific progress? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=756.44s)]
*  You know, if we go back and think about the rise of evolutionary fear or the Enlightenment or the development of neuroscience to explain consciousness. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=761.32s)]
*  Like, are all of those in a way connected to sort of the decline of religion or a challenge to religion? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  Are those things? Do you see those two things as being in tension? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=779.4s)]
*  I think that there are specific moments when you get a set of scientific discoveries or claims or arguments that pose a really specific challenge to religious beliefs. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=783.92s)]
*  Right. And we remember the two most famous ones for a reason. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=795.52s)]
*  Copernicus and Galileo revealed a view of the cosmos that was in tension with the medieval Christian view of the cosmos. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=799.92s)]
*  There was a big clash there. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  You'll get some Catholics who will say, oh, you know, the Galileo thing was overstated and so on. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  But I'm not going to say that. There was a very real clash. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  Parts of the church tried to suppress the new scientific paradigm. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=819.16s)]
*  They ultimately failed. And necessarily that created more skepticism about religious claims. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=823.4s)]
*  And I think you can say the same thing about about Darwinism. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=829.92s)]
*  Darwinism poses a particular challenge to a particular Christian. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's more true of Christianity than Judaism. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=838.04s)]
*  Interpretation of the Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve, the fall and so on. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=840.64s)]
*  There's a challenge fitting that into the Darwinian picture that also undermines religious belief. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=845.84s)]
*  I think the story in the 20th century is a little bit different. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=851.84s)]
*  I think when you're talking about technological shocks, the Internet did not actually introduce new arguments against Christianity. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=854.48s)]
*  It may have spread them or popularized them, but it actually just changed the way people related to the world in a way that pushed people away from going to church and away from familial traditions and a lot of different things. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=863.32s)]
*  But it wasn't like a novel argument, the way Darwinism was a novel argument. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=876.96s)]
*  And the same was true of the pill. The pill changed how people behaved. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=881.12s)]
*  And as it changed how they behaved, they had more more reason to disagree or reject biblical sexual ethics, let's say. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=884.48s)]
*  But it wasn't like a new argument was suddenly invented there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=896.84s)]
*  And really, I think what's interesting about the 20th century is that the story of actual scientific discovery over the last hundred to 120 years. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=900.6s)]
*  Has not tended to challenge the broad religious picture in anything like the way Darwin and to some degree Galileo did. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=911.08s)]
*  If anything, you've had a series of discoveries and revolutions and arguments, starting with the Big Bang Theory, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=919.1600000000001s)]
*  continuing with quantum physics down through what physics has suggested about the really remarkably calibrated order of the universe that we find ourselves in that tend to be closer to what religious people would expect. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=928.8s)]
*  So if anything, and I think this is something I think that is underappreciated because most scientists remain pretty resolutely secular. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=944.88s)]
*  Nonetheless, I think it's the case that if you start the clock at 1900 or so and roll it forward, religion has the religious perspective has been more vindicated than challenged by that that run of modern scientific findings. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=953.88s)]
*  I want to get in in a little bit to the way that you understand sort of the synchronicity or the harmony between science and religion. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=971.04s)]
*  Before I get there, I want to lay out the broad argument of your book and also lay out sort of the pretext for it, which is why we become less religious. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=979.5999999999999s)]
*  By the end of this conversation, everyone who listens to this will have bought a copy of Ross's incredible new book, Believe. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=991.3599999999999s)]
*  But as they're listening to this, they will probably not have read it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=999.1199999999999s)]
*  So I want to just lay out a couple like vocabulary distinctions that I think are important. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  You referenced this a little bit earlier, Ross, but just explain the distinction you make in the book between atheism and secularism, because really, for the purposes of this conversation, we're really talking about secularism. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1007.44s)]
*  What's the difference between the two? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1020.24s)]
*  I mean, atheism is just a kind of hard, confident belief that there is no God and perhaps could not possibly be one. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  Secularism is more the condition of the absence of religious commitment. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1029.24s)]
*  So a secular society could be filled with atheists or it could be filled with people like the ones I described earlier, who are sort of regretful unbelievers, somewhat open to religious arguments, but not yet persuaded. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1035.8s)]
*  Right. So that that would be the distinction. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1050.04s)]
*  So a lot of people, I think, that are just not thinking about these issues see a secular society broadly as a mark of human progress. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1053.0s)]
*  But you argue, and I think I think this has become increasingly difficult to deny, that the oldest human problems, problems of tribalism, superstition, despair, that those are actually the results of a world without religion. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1064.84s)]
*  It's exactly the opposite of the inheritance we were promised by the new atheists. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  Draw that out just a little bit more for the listener. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1085.28s)]
*  Where do those, you know, there's people that argue that, you know, Jonathan Haidt talks about this in his book, The Righteous Minds, that we all have sort of a God shaped hole in us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1088.32s)]
*  And if that hole isn't filled by God, it gets filled by other more terrible things, maybe the belief that the Jews did 9 11 or, you know, any number of other conspiracy theories that are currently rocketing around on X right now. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1098.6s)]
*  But tell us why, when religion declines, these bad human impulses or these tendencies, why they rise? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1111.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, first, it's important to stress that obviously religions themselves can be mainstream religions, major religions can harbor dark tendencies, can be oppressive, tyrannical, all of these things that that part of the secular narrative is obviously not false. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1121.12s)]
*  And you can tell a pretty clear story about the rise of liberalism in particular, where it's a response to just really specifically the inability of Catholics and Protestants to agree on anything without coming to blows and war and persecution. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. So that that's the first concession that needs to be made. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  Having made that concession, though, it is there's sort of two two points worth making. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1157.0s)]
*  The first is that it is really very difficult to imagine the moral structure of contemporary secular liberalism, its commitments to human equality and human dignity and everything that we associate with sort of the iconic figures of the civil rights era or, you know, the founders of American democracy and so on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1162.52s)]
*  Emerging in anything like its current form, absent the influence of biblical religion generally, and then mostly Christianity, though obviously Judaism plays a role, a role as well. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  And there is, in fact, a reason that sort of the culminating figure in the progressive story of American history is Martin Luther King, where if you sit down and read Letter from Birmingham Jail, it is essentially an intra-Christian argument. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1197.48s)]
*  Where King is using Christian rhetoric and language and history and invoking Catholic and Protestant figures to talk to convince his fellow Christians for religious reasons to support racial equality. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1212.04s)]
*  Similarly, it is not a coincidence that the UN Declaration on Human Rights, a sort of totem of modern liberal progress, was heavily influenced and created by a Catholic natural law thinker named Jacques Maritain. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  And you can run through this and you can extend it beyond Christianity, beyond Western religion. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1238.56s)]
*  You can compass a figure like Gandhi, who is nobody's idea of a secular liberal ultimately, but plays this crucial role in the emergence of sort of, you know, the post-colonial world basically. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1243.72s)]
*  So that's one story, right, to say we live in a world where even or especially the liberal perspective is informed by some basic ideas that emerge out of organized religion, out of Christianity, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1256.6s)]
*  and then don't actually make full sense without a Christian metaphysical perspective on the world, right? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1271.32s)]
*  It's if there is no God, if the New Testament is just rubbish and nonsense and so on, then certain ideas about human dignity and human rights, you can still hold them, but there seem like more of a kind of cultural and aesthetic preference and less of a truth grounded in the nature of reality. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1277.88s)]
*  When we did the debate recently in Austin about whether or not the West needs a religious revival, one of the, there are a lot of great moments, but I think one of the more interesting moments was Michael Shermer on the other side was basically saying, you know, humanism, humanistic values tell you essentially that murder is wrong, that sleeping with your sibling is bad. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1297.4s)]
*  And you sort of shot back and was like, well, how do you know murder is wrong? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1318.0800000000002s)]
*  And there was sort of a back and forth that I don't entirely remember. But your point there, I think, is that people who even identify themselves as ardently atheist, forget about secular, you argue are benefiting from choose whatever metaphor you want. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  The fumes of Judaism and Christianity, the retaining walls that those things provide, that the norms that we sort of take for granted in a tolerant, inclusive, liberal, democratic society, if that is indeed still what America is, that the basis and the fundamental, like the scaffolding for all of that is religion, whether or not people recognize it or not. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1339.32s)]
*  And by religion, I mean, you know, Judeo Christianity. I don't even know if you like that phrase. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1365.72s)]
*  No, I think it's I'm actually sort of a defender of that phrase, which has a lot of critics, but we don't need to go down that rabbit hole. I think, yeah, I think the best way to look at it is that liberalism is a is a structure. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1370.64s)]
*  But it requires a kind of internal moral scaffolding that to help you actually adjudicate the moral disputes that come up in a free society. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1383.56s)]
*  And traditionally in the US, that scaffolding was supplied by Protestant Christianity. By the 1950s and 1960s, it was provided by a kind of Judeo-Christian consensus that encompassed Catholics and Jews, as well as Protestants. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1392.8s)]
*  And today it's supplied by a kind of well, one, I think it just clearly doesn't exist to some degree. To the extent that it exists, it's supplied by a kind of you might just say convention, right? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  Where people are like, well, of course, murder is wrong. Not in the sense that this is written into the architecture of the universe and God forbids murder, but in the sense that, of course, you'd rather live in a world, you know, with laws against murder, right? Surely you would. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1418.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm not here to say that that convention can't hold. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1432.08s)]
*  America has not yet fallen and God willing won't into some sort of ruinous, you know, civil war and so on. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1436.32s)]
*  But it is just a much weaker structuring force in that sense. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1443.72s)]
*  But with that said, it's also important to stress that this is not a good enough argument for being religious, right? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  In the end, you know, only an intellectual and not even an intellectual really could commit themselves to religious practice on the grounds that it's really important to provide a scaffolding for liberal society, right? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1457.28s)]
*  And that's and so that that too is obviously part of the argument of of my book, that it is a it is a weakness for religious writers and thinkers to just appeal to secular liberals by saying, look, won't you miss Christianity when it's gone? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1470.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's all just, you know, Nietzscheans of the left and right fighting, fighting endlessly. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  People might agree with that, but it's still not enough. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1492.2s)]
*  In the end, you also have to convince them that religion is reasonable and quite possibly true. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1494.32s)]
*  I see sort of like three arguments going from weakest to strongest, the weakest being the one you just made, the weakest being we need Christianity, the Judeo-Christian consensus as scaffolding. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1500.76s)]
*  And without it, everything is going to go to shit, broadly speaking, something that I believe is true, but is not very convincing to get people to upend and change their lives and order their lives around. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1514.0400000000002s)]
*  Then there's sort of the middle argument. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1523.5200000000002s)]
*  And a lot of people have been making this lately, which is I know a lot of people who feel I wish I could be religious. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't believe in God. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1531.5200000000002s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  Christianity, Judaism, these are good programs. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1534.0400000000002s)]
*  They're great ways to raise a family. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1537.3600000000001s)]
*  And so sort of from a utilitarian perspective, from a way to order my life around this perspective for a communal perspective in a country, in a society where so many of those, you know, communal institutions have fallen away. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1539.52s)]
*  I'm going to go to church. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1554.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm going to go to synagogue. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1554.92s)]
*  I'm going to be religious. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  And frankly, that's a lot of people I know. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1556.8000000000002s)]
*  But you go a step further. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1559.8000000000002s)]
*  You're basically like, no, no. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1561.3200000000002s)]
*  The core free press demographic. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1562.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1564.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1564.72s)]
*  Well, actually, a lot of free pressers are profoundly religious. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1565.24s)]
*  And one thing I find very interesting, which we can maybe talk about later in this conversation, is that I do feel that religious versus non-religious is like one of the great dividing lines of this new politically realigned moment that has been under discussed. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1569.48s)]
*  And we find that a lot in both in the free press newsroom where I'm sitting right now, but also in our audience. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1585.08s)]
*  But you OK. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1590.84s)]
*  But you go a step further. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1591.64s)]
*  You're like, no, not enough for to make the scaffolding for Western civilization argument won't work. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1592.8s)]
*  Also, who cares? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1598.24s)]
*  Not who cares, but not enough. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1599.92s)]
*  The middle position. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1601.44s)]
*  It's a great program for your family. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1602.72s)]
*  Still not enough. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1604.44s)]
*  You, Ross Douthat, are making the argument that people need to go the full way, that they need to actually believe in order to be religious. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1605.56s)]
*  And I want you to make the case. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1615.32s)]
*  Such a con. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1618.0s)]
*  You make it sound like such a controversial claim. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1618.6000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm just saying. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1621.08s)]
*  It's asking a lot. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1621.92s)]
*  I think it's asking a lot because to get to this is what is actually if you wrote a book, if you wrote a book to the middle position, which you could have done saying, hey, guys, listen, I know you may or may not like me, Ross Douthat, believe not just in God, but in demons. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1623.64s)]
*  And we will get to demons later in this conversation. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1637.44s)]
*  Sure, we will. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1639.8000000000002s)]
*  It's a better life to be religious. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1640.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think you could get huge consensus around that, actually, in this moment. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1642.28s)]
*  Tell me why you're making the stronger version of the argument. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1646.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think that's quite the wrong way to look at it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1649.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1653.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1653.48s)]
*  So the second thing, the second approach that you're suggesting is seems to me to be actually really, really difficult because it is, in fact, difficult to practice a religion. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1653.72s)]
*  Now, you know, every religion is different. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1666.2s)]
*  Some religions are more difficult than others. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1668.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1671.0s)]
*  But, you know, I'm familiar to keep kosher. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1671.28s)]
*  I am. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1673.8s)]
*  I have many Jewish friends. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1674.8s)]
*  I am familiar with the challenges of practicing Judaism seriously. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1676.28s)]
*  I am. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1680.36s)]
*  You know, it's lent in Catholicism and, you know, it seems like a small thing. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1681.72s)]
*  But you I got up this morning to make my children lunch and almost forgot that I couldn't put any meat in their lunch boxes. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1685.84s)]
*  And that's the minimal stuff. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1693.08s)]
*  Like I am. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1694.2s)]
*  You know, I have this reputation as a very conservative Catholic. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1694.92s)]
*  You know, no, no more conservative person has ever, ever appeared. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1699.52s)]
*  Surely. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1703.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1704.04s)]
*  In the pages of the New York Times or something. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1704.3999999999999s)]
*  But I'm barely getting my kids to church on Sunday. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1706.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1709.4399999999998s)]
*  Like just the sort of de minimis aspects of practicing Roman Catholicism are extremely difficult, especially for anyone who, you know, to invoke cliche lives in this fast paced modern world of ours. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1709.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1722.4399999999998s)]
*  With infinite distractions and obligations and so on. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1722.76s)]
*  So if you're undertaking part two, or version two, right, you are undertaking all of the hard stuff of religion and telling yourself that, oh, well, this is much easier than actually believing in God. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1725.84s)]
*  And what I am claiming, and obviously this is a controversial claim and, you know, I haven't yet persuaded most of my secular interlocutors of it. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1739.36s)]
*  But what I am suggesting is that believing that God exists. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1748.7199999999998s)]
*  Not I'm not not getting all the way to specific Christian doctrines or the burning bush or, you know, anything like that, but just generally believing there's probably a God. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1753.2s)]
*  World was probably made for a reason. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1763.0s)]
*  Human beings probably have a place in some kind of divine plan. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1765.2s)]
*  You probably should be prepared to be called to account after you die for how you've lived your life. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1768.84s)]
*  I think that belief is actually not that hard. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  It should not be that hard to get to that specific belief. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1777.2s)]
*  And it seems to me easier to get to that belief than it does to practice an entire religion and certainly much easier to get to that belief than to try and practice a religion without it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  So that's that's that's the claim. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1793.64s)]
*  Like, I think people have made it too hot. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1795.48s)]
*  Like they have built in their mind this idea that to believe in God is this incredible leap of faith that no only, you know, only only Kierkegaard and Mother Teresa, right, could possibly make. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1797.36s)]
*  And I think that they've made I think they've made it out to be a little bit harder than it actually is. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1811.6s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1817.6399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1818.24s)]
*  There's a lot of people who come on this show. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1818.8s)]
*  I'm thinking of Kemi Badenoch, Louise Perry, who are sort of like broadly sharing of your general political worldview, who call themselves cultural Christians, who are in kind of the second camp. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1820.44s)]
*  And I think if you said to many of those people, not those two specifically, but many of those people just believe in God, it would sound a little bit like just be in love with me. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1833.24s)]
*  Like you're asking someone to do something that is feels almost I don't want to say impossible, but it's like a category. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1841.8799999999999s)]
*  It's different than choosing to vote for a party or get on a diet. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1850.56s)]
*  It's like you're asking someone to feel a thing. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1856.68s)]
*  How do you make that ask of people? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1859.72s)]
*  Explain explain that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1861.68s)]
*  I'm not initially asking people to feel a thing that I think the point the argument in my book is to try and carry people. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1862.8799999999999s)]
*  Up to the idea that they should want to feel a thing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1871.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  Like it's like I'm trying to convince people that romantic love is possible. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  And there is, you know, there is almost certainly someone out there in the world who you could be in love with. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1881.76s)]
*  And here's some advice for going on dates and trying to, you know, trying to get to know someone who you might potentially marry. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1886.76s)]
*  This is a very crude way of putting it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1893.96s)]
*  But I but it's yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  But but I think that's you're saying stop hooking up with people. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  Go get in. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1901.4s)]
*  Let's try. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1902.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I mean, the thing is, you know, even even hooking up with people is some kind of act of of at least for some people, not the, you know, not the totally promiscuous, but it's it's it's at least an act towards something like and in that sense, I am saying, you know, ideally, you would not just dabble in religious traditions. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1902.4s)]
*  You would not just sort of hook up with one religion one week and another next. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1922.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1925.64s)]
*  The ultimate goal is to settle down. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1925.8000000000002s)]
*  But even there, it's better to hook up than just sit home and say, oh, man, I, you know, I can't find true love. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1928.3200000000002s)]
*  It must not exist and not even try. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1934.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1937.04s)]
*  And so this this is this is the this is the the core idea is that there is a part of religion that is about relationship feeling. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1937.3600000000001s)]
*  And Christians certainly would say about grace that you can't do it on your own. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1948.8s)]
*  There's a kind of belief in God you can't get to without God giving something to you. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1952.8s)]
*  But at the same time, there is a level of confidence you should have that there is something out there worthy of that feeling. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1958.24s)]
*  And that is something that I do think people can reason towards. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1965.36s)]
*  And this is obviously a very conventional idea that has been held by many serious people in many times and places. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1969.24s)]
*  It's just not held by the intelligentsia today. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1976.24s)]
*  But it was perfectly normal for much of human history for people to say, look, there's parts of God that can only be known through revelation and through faith. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1978.28s)]
*  But the basic idea that there is some being called God or some higher power that created and ordered the universe, that just sort of makes sense because we can look around at the universe and see lots of forms of evidence pointing in that direction. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=1986.52s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things that is unique about this book is that you are saying not take a leap of faith, you know, or have a revelatory experience, which is, I think, how most people think about the impulse. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2001.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say the choice to be religious, because I think for a lot of people, it doesn't feel like a choice. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2016.44s)]
*  And you are saying it is logical. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2020.04s)]
*  You are making the empirical case for religion. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2023.3600000000001s)]
*  You are saying it is more reasonable to believe than to not believe. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2025.92s)]
*  Explain that to people a little bit more. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2030.68s)]
*  Well, so you find yourself as a human being in a world, right? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2033.64s)]
*  And, you know, you and I don't have perfect access to each other's consciousness. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2038.6000000000001s)]
*  But generally speaking, I think it's safe to say we find ourselves in the same world. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2043.44s)]
*  And this world presents itself first as a ordered, structured, mathematically precise, predictable universe governed by physical laws that turn out, again, this is based on the best of modern science, to be incredibly precisely calibrated to yield stars, planets, and life itself. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2048.2000000000003s)]
*  The odds of a universe like ours appearing by chance out of all the possible universes are extremely slim. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2076.08s)]
*  And by extremely slim, I mean, you know, one in a quadrillion or something much larger than that. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2083.64s)]
*  Right. So that's that's sort of reality. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2089.28s)]
*  Number one. Now, I think that right now that sort of yields two potential options for understanding where this universe comes from. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2091.68s)]
*  There are sort of two working theories. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2099.76s)]
*  One theory is that, you know, mind in some way precedes matter, that there is some kind of intentionality and consciousness that is behind the world and organizes the world and has ordered it. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2101.6400000000003s)]
*  The other alternative is basically the multiverse hypothesis familiar from Marvel Cinema and, you know, many other works that says, well, the answer must be that all of those other quadrillion universes also exist and we just can't see them. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2114.6800000000003s)]
*  And we happen to be in this one because there are no observers in any of the others. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2130.72s)]
*  So, of course, we see this one because it's the only one that could ever have an observer, et cetera. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2134.6s)]
*  Right. And I don't think you have to choose absolutely between those. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2139.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think if you posit it like that, at the very least, the religious perspective that says there is some kind of consciousness and intentionality is not obviously losing that argument. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2143.04s)]
*  And the multiverse hypothesis is not the equivalent of like Darwinian evolution, where it's some sort of testable hypothesis about the material world that we see. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2153.52s)]
*  It is a much more skeptical speculative metaphysical picture. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2163.12s)]
*  Right. OK. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2167.12s)]
*  Step one, step two, you and I as beings in this world have a thing called consciousness that is quite mysterious. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2168.56s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly where it comes from. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2176.8s)]
*  No one can quite tell how it emerges from material matter. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2179.12s)]
*  No one can quite tell if it is absolutely necessary to sort of the ordinary things we do. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2183.52s)]
*  It seems like maybe we could exist as some kind of zombies doing all the things we do without consciousness and will. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2189.72s)]
*  Certainly, this is what some people think AI is going to turn out to be. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2196.64s)]
*  Others think it will develop consciousness. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2200.16s)]
*  But either way, we have this consciousness. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2201.8399999999997s)]
*  This consciousness is capable of understanding the universe we find ourselves in. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2204.04s)]
*  It's capable of reasoning about it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2208.2s)]
*  It's capable of astonishing scientific discoveries, wild mathematical speculations that turn out to map amazingly onto the universe itself. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2209.64s)]
*  Well, what does that look like? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2220.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, again, if you combine it with the first argument, if you say there might be a mind behind the whole cosmos, our minds seem to be impressively capable of penetrating and understanding the cosmos. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2222.2s)]
*  I think right there you've reached something like the Old Testament line that human beings are made in the image of God. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2234.16s)]
*  There's a mind above all things. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2240.08s)]
*  Our minds participate in the reality that mind has created. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2241.9199999999996s)]
*  And that is a religious picture of the world. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2245.6s)]
*  And then add in, you know, this is weirder and more speculative and so on. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2249.12s)]
*  But one of the striking things about quantum physics, right, is that it strongly suggests that mind and matter are entangled in some strange way. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2253.04s)]
*  Where our minds participate in collapsing potentialities into actualities. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2261.9199999999996s)]
*  In other words, without some sort of mind, the universe would always be potential and never actual, which is a pretty interesting thing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2268.48s)]
*  Again, seems pretty consonant with a religious perspective. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  And then finally add in and again, you mentioned the demons, right? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2279.68s)]
*  So we're getting in that direction. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2283.12s)]
*  Add in the resilience and persistence of religious experience in secular and disenchanted conditions, right? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2284.96s)]
*  Like, it's not just that the world seems shaped and ordered. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2291.72s)]
*  It's not just that we seem to understand and participate and even create that order. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2295.04s)]
*  It's also that in every culture and every time and place, people are constantly having weird intimations of transcendence, higher powers, near death experiences. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2299.3199999999997s)]
*  And yes, occasionally dark, what the people who use psychedelics call negative entities. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2308.96s)]
*  And what you, Ross, call demons. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2316.0s)]
*  What I call, you know, what I, yeah, what I call the devil and his minions, right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  But so again, so this is obviously a really truncated version of the argument, but I've also been talking for too long. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2322.7999999999997s)]
*  So I'll just stop there and say, generally, it's not that I'm saying this picture should leave you 100% convinced that there is a god, but it is a set of converging lines, converging lines, converging parts of reality that I think tell a fairly [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2330.7599999999998s)]
*  consistent story that should at least take someone past like a Pascal's wager thing where you're like, well, there's a one in a hundred chance there's a god. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2347.24s)]
*  And if there is, maybe I'll get to go to heaven. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2356.8399999999997s)]
*  So I better take a bet. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2358.9199999999996s)]
*  No, I think it takes you much more towards there is probably something like the kind of god described by the major world religions. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2359.8399999999997s)]
*  And I should probably take that god's existence seriously in my everyday life. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2368.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that some people will hear the connection that you're making between the sort of the similarities of human consciousness, the order of our minds and the order of the cosmos. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2374.76s)]
*  And they'll say, well, Ross, it actually makes it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2386.6000000000004s)]
*  It actually drives me toward a different conclusion, which is that, you know, I don't want to sound too galaxy brain, but like we're so of the we're so of the earth because we evolved to be that way. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2390.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. Well, this is no this and this is actually on the particular question of consciousness and its understanding of reality. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2404.76s)]
*  This is actually a key and useful debate, right? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2411.0400000000004s)]
*  Where, yes, the argument goes, well, of course you would expect us to be able to understand the heights and depths of reality because it is evolutionarily adaptive to have this kind of understanding that doesn't answer the question of why we are conscious to begin with, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2413.96s)]
*  why we have something called understanding, why we perceive the world the way we do. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2432.56s)]
*  But it does provide a potential explanation. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2437.0s)]
*  The question is, does that explanation make sense? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2440.0s)]
*  And the explanation takes for granted the idea that a, you know, an early hominid, let's say, evolving to deal with life in the savanna, you know, wherever, wherever early hominids evolved. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2442.96s)]
*  Right. You need to deal with saber toothed tigers or, you know, elephants or whatever. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2458.0s)]
*  You need to deal with you need some kind of toolkit and that toolkit needs to be predictive and it needs to let you make decisions and needs to let you reason in some simplified way. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2462.36s)]
*  OK, fair enough. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2472.92s)]
*  That's that's the toolkit we have. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2473.92s)]
*  We have a under evolutionary hypotheses. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2476.28s)]
*  We have that. Let's call it a panther dodging toolkit. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2478.84s)]
*  Does it stand to reason that that toolkit would generalize upward towards the basic principles of mathematics towards the capacity to split the atom towards the, you know, the understanding of how the physical laws of the cosmos work? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2482.76s)]
*  And I think we take it for granted that it does because it obviously does. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2500.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. We are very, very successful. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2503.84s)]
*  Right. But I think it's really, really easy to imagine. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2505.96s)]
*  Toolkits that just and versions of the cosmos where the language of mathematics, let's say, is just completely distinct from, you know, your your ability to to anticipate when a panther is going to leap at you or something like that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2510.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. And and this is you hear this, I think, like if you talk to serious mathematicians, even if they aren't conventionally religious, they do tend to have a kind of mystical understanding. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2527.24s)]
*  Of their own discipline, like, why do these forms that we hold in our minds actually end up having these perfectly predictive roles in figuring out material reality? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2540.6s)]
*  And I just don't think that is to necessarily be expected from just sort of the evolution of survival capacities. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2551.6s)]
*  I think it is, you know, again, it is strongly suggestive of a more profound connection between what our mind does and what it's made for in the order, the order of the universe itself. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2561.3999999999996s)]
*  And again, just to repeat myself, that theory doesn't explain why we have this sort of this perceptual existence to begin with. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2573.6s)]
*  And the age of A.I. is sort of throwing this into relief because we are building machines. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2585.36s)]
*  We aren't building machines to have the kind of perceptual awareness that we have because we have no idea how to give it to them. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2590.1600000000003s)]
*  We're building machines to act intelligently without perceptual awareness, which creates a stronger mystery about where this sense of self and selfhood comes from. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2597.36s)]
*  Ross, you write in the book that people should demand a foundation of basic reasonability from religion. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2608.96s)]
*  I think that idea will seem strange to a lot of people listening because they will think of religion as a belief in the unbelievable, a belief in the miraculous and a belief in the things that defy logic. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2616.36s)]
*  You know, we're almost at Easter, the holiday that celebrates. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2629.56s)]
*  It's a very special episode. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2634.36s)]
*  The resurrection of a human being rising from the dead. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2635.96s)]
*  You know, we might debate about whether or not he's a human being. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2640.76s)]
*  And you're telling me and I'm speaking now for the listener. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2644.76s)]
*  We spent a few hundred years on that one. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2647.56s)]
*  But you're saying that is the most reasonable perspective on reality. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2649.56s)]
*  Like that seems asking someone to believe in a person literally rising from the dead seems profoundly. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2653.16s)]
*  I don't want to say unreasonable. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2661.56s)]
*  That might not be a word, but to believe in the unbelievable, to believe in the miraculous, contend with that for me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2662.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's anything unreasonable about believing in the possibility of miracles. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2669.96s)]
*  I think, you know, if you if you envision a the universe as a system created by a conscious mind, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2676.36s)]
*  which I have been trying to argue is a reasonable supposition based on what we know scientifically and to some degree philosophically [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2685.6600000000003s)]
*  about the nature of the universe and the nature of our minds, then there is no necessary reason to assume [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2693.96s)]
*  that the conscious mind that created this universe could not intervene in the working of its physical laws [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2703.16s)]
*  in certain crucial ways to steer the history of a species that it happens to care about in particular directions. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2709.3599999999997s)]
*  I think I think the confusion comes in because it is perfectly sensible for science and scientists [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2718.66s)]
*  who are indeed the most reasonable of professions, potentially at least not always right. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2726.8599999999997s)]
*  To, you know, to sort of not never presume a miracle, right? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2733.06s)]
*  Like it is it is an you are you are a foe of science. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2737.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. If you say this apparent discontinuity in the laws of the universe can be explained by an angel stepping in every day [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2741.06s)]
*  to, you know, carry a planet through this mysterious part of its orbit or something, right? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2751.36s)]
*  Science is the search for the regular laws, the consistent laws, the fundamental laws that predict and explain the system of the world. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2756.36s)]
*  And as such, it isn't necessarily in the business of studying miracles and it should have a bias against them. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2763.1600000000003s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it's unreasonable to think they happen. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2770.46s)]
*  Right. And you can put this, I think, you know, for at least some listeners or viewers, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2773.26s)]
*  a the kind who maybe hang out around Silicon Valley or something like a bunch of people in Silicon Valley [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2778.26s)]
*  have decided that the universe is probably a simulation, right? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2785.16s)]
*  We're living in a simulation and they've decided this because they believe in the multiverse. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2789.2599999999998s)]
*  They're like, OK, we're in the multiverse. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2792.56s)]
*  There's an infinite number of universes and each universe eventually, you know, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2794.2599999999998s)]
*  would have people in it capable of simulating another infinite set of universes. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2798.06s)]
*  And so most universes will be simulated universes. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2802.3599999999997s)]
*  And so we're probably in one. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2805.06s)]
*  Now, I have a lot of disagreements with that perspective on the world, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2806.7599999999998s)]
*  but it does offer a somewhat useful way of thinking about the miraculous [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2810.3599999999997s)]
*  because if you are inside a simulation, then in fact, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2813.26s)]
*  there's nothing unreasonable about the assumption that whoever is running the simulation would might intervene in it [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2817.46s)]
*  from time to time in ways that disturb the formal regularities of the system. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2823.36s)]
*  And that is what religious people are claiming is true about the cosmos that we inhabit, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2828.1600000000003s)]
*  that it is a regular system that is occasionally sort of intervened in by its architect to, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2833.26s)]
*  I think Christians would say, to establish a pattern of signs and revelations and indicators [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2841.26s)]
*  that are helpful to ordinary mortals like you and me trying to figure out what God wants of us [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2846.26s)]
*  and how to live their life. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2850.96s)]
*  And the Christian perspective, obviously, is that the biggest and most important of these is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2851.86s)]
*  The Jewish perspective is the biggest and most important is probably, you know, God's revelation on Mount Sinai, right? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2857.76s)]
*  But this is what religions are claiming, basically, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2864.76s)]
*  not that the universe is, you know, is sort of irrational and inherently unpredictable, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2867.46s)]
*  but that the universe is law-bound and predictable and miracles are the exceptions to the rule [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2872.46s)]
*  that are perfectly rational if you understand that there's someone running the whole system. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2877.36s)]
*  And then with the key point, right, that in fact, things that appear miraculous do happen a great deal. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2883.56s)]
*  And this is- [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2891.06s)]
*  Have you had a miracle in your own life? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2891.86s)]
*  Have you experienced the miraculous? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2895.76s)]
*  I would say that I have observed more than experienced. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2897.76s)]
*  So I spent part of my childhood in, you know, hanging around Pentecostalist and Charismatic circles [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2903.26s)]
*  for reasons that had to do with my parents' religious journey. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2910.76s)]
*  And I would say at the very least, I have a lot of exposure to religious experiences. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2914.76s)]
*  Now, are religious experiences miraculous in the way that the resurrection is miraculous? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2920.76s)]
*  No, not exactly. They're more in there, but they do present themselves as external interventions [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2925.76s)]
*  into human beings by outside powers and forces that are not just sort of generated by the psyche or the self, right? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2932.76s)]
*  And so, you know, if you read William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2940.76s)]
*  the famous, you know, the famous attempt to sort of catalog and analyze these experiences, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2945.26s)]
*  I saw things like that happen to my parents and people I know. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2949.76s)]
*  And my perspective on those events was that they really did strongly appear to be outside interventions [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2953.76s)]
*  into human beings who, you know, I knew and respected and trusted, who were not insane, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2961.76s)]
*  were not schizophrenic, were not epileptic. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2966.26s)]
*  And those experiences require some kind of explanation. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2969.76s)]
*  Now, can you come up with a materialist explanation, a purely psychological explanation? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2973.76s)]
*  Certainly such explanations are on offer, but they are a persistent feature of the world, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2978.76s)]
*  as one would expect if the religious perspective on the world is correct. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2984.76s)]
*  Then one can go a bit further and say, okay, near-death experiences are a bit stranger. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2988.76s)]
*  They, you know, people die, they're resuscitated, they're brought back to life, or they come close to death. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=2994.76s)]
*  I don't want to stipulate that they're completely brain dead. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3000.76s)]
*  They come close to the threshold of death and they come back often with really powerful stories of encounters [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3003.76s)]
*  with beings and realities that, again, map pretty, in a general way, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3010.76s)]
*  onto what a lot of religions describe about the afterlife. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3016.76s)]
*  These experiences are much more available to us in the 21st century than they ever were before in all of human history, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3021.76s)]
*  because we bring so many people back from the brink of death. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3029.76s)]
*  And in fact, it was a great surprise to people studying these experiences in the 1960s and 1970s [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3032.76s)]
*  when this sort of takes off just how commonplace they are. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3038.76s)]
*  Not that everyone has them, but they're a persistent feature of near-death moments. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3041.76s)]
*  Now, could this all be in people's heads? Sure. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3048.76s)]
*  It's a little hard to devise an evolutionary explanation of this phenomenon that, in most of human history, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3051.76s)]
*  would have only happened to people who just went on to die. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3057.76s)]
*  What's the evolutionary advantage if you see your dead relatives in the bright light, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3060.76s)]
*  but then you can never tell anyone about it? Unclear, but maybe there is some. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3066.76s)]
*  But at the very least, what I'm asking the secular person to concede is this. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3070.76s)]
*  Go back 100, 150 years and sit a religious person and a secular person down and tell them both, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3075.76s)]
*  guess what, in the next 100, 150 years, we're going to bring a lot more people back from the brink of death. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3082.76s)]
*  What do you expect that they'll say? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3087.76s)]
*  And I think that the good atheist would say, probably you'll get a mixture of people seeing nothing at all, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3089.76s)]
*  because there's nothing after death, and like weird hallucinations, fragmentary experiences, dream-like situations, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3095.76s)]
*  the brain on the brink of death, misfiring, and so on. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3101.76s)]
*  And the religious person would say, well, probably some of them will see heaven and maybe some of them will see hell. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3104.76s)]
*  And, you know, the religious... [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3109.76s)]
*  No one seems to see hell with these near-death experiences. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3111.76s)]
*  No, this is actually, again, with the demons, people do have some dark near-death experiences. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3114.76s)]
*  They just are less, substantially less likely to write books about them and to report them. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3120.76s)]
*  But there is, not that I recommend this exactly, but there's an interesting reading on this. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3126.76s)]
*  But my point is just that what has actually happened is what the religious person would expect. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3132.76s)]
*  Where can someone find those? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3137.76s)]
*  Because every near-death experience I've ever read is the bright light, you see your ancestors, maybe people who have gone. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3139.76s)]
*  It sounds like people are almost... you have to fight to resist going toward it, because that's how wonderful it is. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3146.76s)]
*  I've literally never read about a near-death experience with something approximating hell. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3154.76s)]
*  If I wanted to find that, do I have to like go to some weird Reddit board? Where do I find it? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3159.76s)]
*  No, well, I mean, if you, honestly, if you Google hellish near-death experiences, you will find it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3163.76s)]
*  But you will find examples. I generally would say I recommend a book called After by a doctor named Bruce Grayson, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3171.76s)]
*  which is... there have been a lot of surveys of the literature on this going back. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3180.76s)]
*  Raymond Moody in the 1960s is the guy who first starts writing about this. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3185.76s)]
*  I think Grayson's book is the best sort of overall guide to what, from his perspective, the data seems to show [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3189.76s)]
*  and why you should take it at least somewhat seriously. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3197.76s)]
*  I believe that he talks about negative near-death experiences. If he doesn't, I apologize. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3200.76s)]
*  But I would... that's the first book that I sometimes direct people towards. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3205.76s)]
*  Okay. I have encountered so many people who don't believe in God, but wish they were. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3213.76s)]
*  The producer of this show said, I wished I believed in God, but I just can't turn it on like a light switch. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3221.76s)]
*  What is your advice to that person? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3228.76s)]
*  Well, here, I mean, here there is obviously some truth to the advice that, again, the people sort of in your second group are sort of taking, right? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3231.76s)]
*  The idea that, you know, sometimes you feel like you can't believe, but maybe you practice, maybe you participate, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3241.76s)]
*  maybe you pray, you act as though you are religious, and maybe that connection is open and belief becomes possible, right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3248.76s)]
*  And so, I mean, one fun thing about writing a book like this and doing a lot of interviews with people who are sort of in the camp of friendly to religion [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3258.76s)]
*  but not convinced is you realize that, you know, everybody is different, right? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3268.76s)]
*  And everyone who is not religious but interested has some different stumbling block. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3272.76s)]
*  So you'll talk to one person for whom the arguments that I've made about physics and fine-tuning are totally convincing, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3277.76s)]
*  but when you get to near-death experiences, they're like, come on, I'm just not going to go there with you, Ross. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3284.76s)]
*  And then, well, I mean, he is actually religious, but I did a podcast with our mutual friend Andrew Sullivan. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3289.76s)]
*  And, you know, Andrew is just having none of the arguments from design. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3295.76s)]
*  He's like, come on, the universe is too big and cold, you know, it just doesn't seem right. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3298.76s)]
*  But Andrew is an experiencer. He's had mystical experiences. He believes in God for mystical reasons. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3304.76s)]
*  So in terms of giving advice, I'm not saying that, you know, for everyone it makes sense to try and reason your way to God before you start practicing a religion. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3309.76s)]
*  For some people, it's going to work the other way around. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3319.76s)]
*  You're going to practice and some kind of experience is going to come and reason is going to trail afterward. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3322.76s)]
*  With that said, I do think that the idea of sort of belief as this sort of intense feeling of the presence of God, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3328.76s)]
*  it's okay not to have that yet and still say there probably is a God because it kind of makes sense of things. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3339.76s)]
*  I don't agree. This may be my psychological, my own psychological impediment, but I don't think that should be so hard. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3349.76s)]
*  But this is where I think that middle position we were talking about before is so compelling. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3356.76s)]
*  And I don't want to say is Jewish or not Jewish, but to me feels Jewish. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3361.76s)]
*  There's an idea when there's this biblical idea of the Jews receiving the Torah. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3364.76s)]
*  I don't want to go into it too much because it's not important, but the relevant thing is a phrase they say. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3370.76s)]
*  It's all important. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3374.76s)]
*  Of course, it's important. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3375.76s)]
*  But for the sake of this conversation, the thing that is said that comes up a lot in Jewish life is naseh v'nishma. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3376.76s)]
*  The translation of this is we will do and then we will understand. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3382.76s)]
*  In other words, what are all these crazy laws and kosher and Shabbat and all these things? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3385.76s)]
*  It's like they seem crazy. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3389.76s)]
*  But if you do it, what will lead from it is something like I think what you're describing. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3391.76s)]
*  And to me, that is where the way you're calling belief, I might describe as practice. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3397.76s)]
*  And if you do the practice enough, I think the belief can often follow from that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3404.76s)]
*  And for me, that is a much more doable prescription for people than believe in God, guys. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3409.76s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3417.76s)]
*  I don't think that that is a reasonable ask for people because the bar like it's like. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3418.76s)]
*  So why? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3424.76s)]
*  I mean, obviously this is true of many people, but I'm curious. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3425.76s)]
*  Like suppose you were partially convinced by the run of arguments that I just made. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3430.76s)]
*  Maybe you're not. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3434.76s)]
*  But suppose someone is partially convinced. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3435.76s)]
*  You're like, hmm, yeah, the universe seems structured and orderly. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3437.76s)]
*  Human consciousness seems to have some relationship to that order. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3441.76s)]
*  Hmm, there are still a lot of weird religious experiences out there. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3443.76s)]
*  Why would it not follow from that to say not again, not I'm 100% sure there's a God, but hey, there might well be a God. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3447.76s)]
*  Why does that seem like such a such a leap? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3457.76s)]
*  I just think for many people who were raised in the secular liberal waters that we were talking about in the beginning of this conversation, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3459.76s)]
*  belief in God feels like the highest level to get to and a much lower rung on the ladder toward that is this is a great way to order your life. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3467.76s)]
*  This is a great way to order your family's life. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3479.76s)]
*  This will give you meaning structure. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3482.76s)]
*  And by the way, going back to the Pascal's Wager thing, if it ends up being that in the end of the day, the flying spaghetti monsters, whatever you called it, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3485.76s)]
*  you know, the God in the sky that Ross and so many other people believe in is true. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3494.76s)]
*  All the better. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3499.76s)]
*  He's not technically. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3500.76s)]
*  I mean, sometimes he's in the sky, but, you know, you get what I mean. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3502.76s)]
*  Technically, he's outside of time and space. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3505.76s)]
*  But right. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3508.76s)]
*  But but this is in a sense, I guess, from from my perspective. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3509.76s)]
*  And again, there are ways in which, you know, human beings just don't quite get each other right sometimes. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3514.76s)]
*  And there is there is something about that view that I don't quite get. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3519.76s)]
*  And because from my perspective, from a Christian and also a Jewish perspective, right, there are sort of two levels. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3523.76s)]
*  There is a level of understanding of God, certainly, that can only be attained through some combination of practice, grace and revelation. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3530.76s)]
*  Right. Yes, you can't understand the purpose of all the two billion Jewish commandments. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3540.76s)]
*  I know it's slightly fewer than that until you actually. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3545.76s)]
*  Six hundred and thirteen, Ross. Six hundred and thirteen. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3548.76s)]
*  I can never remember the exact number. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3550.76s)]
*  So I play right. So, you know, until you've kept kosher and, you know, done done everything, you can't understand, you know, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3551.76s)]
*  the doctrine of the Trinity, right, to take a particularly strange Christian tradition that is, if not contrary to reason, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3559.76s)]
*  I would not tell you the doctrine of the Trinity is perfectly reasonable in a kind of normal scientific way. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3567.76s)]
*  Right. There's all kinds of stuff in religion that you can only get to in the way you describe. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3572.76s)]
*  But both if you had, you know, both Thomas Aquinas and Maimonides here, right, with us, you know, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3577.76s)]
*  the greatest Jew and the greatest Christian when it comes to these things, they would both say, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3583.76s)]
*  Sure, the fullness of Judaism and Catholicism is only accessible through all these practices and rituals and so on and revelation and grace, whatever. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3587.76s)]
*  But like the idea that the universe was probably made by some kind of creator, like that's basic. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3595.76s)]
*  That that's that should just not be that hard to get to. That's reasonable. Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3603.76s)]
*  And and I guess part of my perspective on this is, you know, I obviously am not going to successfully convince everyone of this. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3607.76s)]
*  But I do think that you can't ultimately have a sort of full religious revival, a really a real recreation of this, you know, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3614.76s)]
*  whatever the religious scaffolding we're talking about is until more people sort of I feel like they're sort of set aside what I think is a kind of instilled prejudice [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3623.76s)]
*  that like belief in God is this impossibly high thing that you can only get to after spending 27 years on a, you know, on a pillar contemplating it and return instead to, you know, the wisdom, the wisdom of the ancients that says belief in God. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3636.76s)]
*  That's the easy part. What's the hard part? The hard part is being being being a good Christian, being a good Jew. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3651.76s)]
*  Right. The hard part is living in harmony with whatever God wants for your life. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3659.76s)]
*  The hard part is also wrestling with, you know, the entirely legitimate questions that people have about God. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3663.76s)]
*  But, you know, I spend a little bit of time, not enough, in the book talking about the problem of evil, right. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3671.76s)]
*  And the questions of why there are suffering in the questions of why there are suffering in the world. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3677.76s)]
*  And if you look into the Old Testament and the New Testament, you will find that religious believers are not setting those questions aside. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3681.76s)]
*  It's not like when you become religious, oh, well, we've taken care of that. Now we know why bad things happen to good people. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3689.76s)]
*  No, they're constantly arguing about it, complaining to God. Abraham is like lawyering with God, right. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3694.76s)]
*  Jesus is God himself from a Christian perspective is weeping in the garden of Gethsemane because he has to go die on the cross. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3701.76s)]
*  Basically, all the hard stuff is there in religion. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3709.76s)]
*  But from a religious perspective, you know, it's a good reason to be uncertain, doubtful, like what does God want of me? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3715.76s)]
*  I have all kinds of doubts about those kinds of things. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3722.76s)]
*  Is it a good reason to think that the universe is an accident, that human consciousness is an illusion, that, you know, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3726.76s)]
*  that we don't have free will, that we don't have free will, that we as beings don't really exist. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3736.76s)]
*  We're just sort of some sort of illusion stapled onto our existence. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3743.76s)]
*  And oh, and by the way, that there's and, you know, this is all explained because there are 100 trillion other universes that we will never taste and see. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3748.76s)]
*  Like, is that the more reasonable perspective? Again, I don't think it is. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3755.76s)]
*  A lot of people and you and I both know a lot of these people. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3762.76s)]
*  I think they tend to be more women than men have been saying over the past decade or so kind of in my view, hungering for a religious life or hungering to fill that longing inside of them, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3765.76s)]
*  that they're spiritual, but not religious. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3777.76s)]
*  And they do everything. They do yoga, meditation, astrology, crystals, tarot, like you name it. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3779.76s)]
*  They do it. Why is that not the right solution? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3786.76s)]
*  Why is that not sufficient? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3789.76s)]
*  I mean, again, I don't want to say it's not the right thing initially. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3792.76s)]
*  Right? Like if you became suddenly convinced by my really, really persuasive arguments that God probably exists, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3797.76s)]
*  and then you look out at the world and you're like, wow, there's a lot of religious traditions. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3805.76s)]
*  Hard to figure out which one is true. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3809.76s)]
*  Entering a kind of experimental mode for some period of time, I think, is reasonable and is rational. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3810.76s)]
*  But there's a few issues there. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3818.76s)]
*  Over a longer time horizon, what are you actually trying to do? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3821.76s)]
*  Like how are you going to actually make progress as someone who thinks there might be higher powers in the world? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3826.76s)]
*  And, you know, first of all, individualism in most human endeavors tends to be insufficient. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3834.76s)]
*  There are exceptions, right? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3843.76s)]
*  But in general, you want to become good at a sport. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3845.76s)]
*  You want to become, you know, good at a discipline. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3848.76s)]
*  You want to become involved in politics and so on. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3851.76s)]
*  At some point you have to join, right? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3853.76s)]
*  You have to participate. You have to have communal support and solidarity. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3856.76s)]
*  You have to have someone testing your own wildest ideas. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3859.76s)]
*  You come home and you're like, you know, I had this brilliant, you know, brilliant idea for, you know, a new pitch in baseball. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3863.76s)]
*  And the person's like, well, you know, someone already invented that pitch and it blew out everybody's arms when they tried to throw it, right? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3870.76s)]
*  Like, you know, there is a sort of organizations and institutions exist to channel human activity for a reason. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3876.76s)]
*  This is true in secular pursuits. It's also true in religion. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3886.76s)]
*  So just from the point of view of like, are you disciplining yourself? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3889.76s)]
*  Are you advancing? Are you making progress? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3893.76s)]
*  Are you in conversation with a serious tradition larger than yourself? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3895.76s)]
*  Unless you really think you are the greatest religious genius of the age, there's always a case for some kind of joining, some kind of communal participation, right? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3899.76s)]
*  And then there's also the reality that like, you know, you want to have a certain degree of humility and say, OK, even if I'm a total religious relativist, I think all of these religions, they're all maps to the same destination. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3909.76s)]
*  Even then, does it make sense to say, I'm going to take a piece of this map and a piece of that map and tape them together and assume that that map will be great? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3922.76s)]
*  I think there's a certain kind of unwarranted presumption there. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3930.76s)]
*  And then hanging over this. And again, we just keep circling back to the demons, Barry, is the reality that if the supernatural exists, like your spiritual but not religious friends, presume that a spiritual landscape exists. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3933.76s)]
*  They have spiritual experiences. They have experiences in some cases, at least of beings and spirits that seem external to themselves. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3947.76s)]
*  People have these experiences taking ayahuasca. They have these experiences, you know, practicing witchcraft. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3956.76s)]
*  They have these experiences meditating and so on. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3962.76s)]
*  It's maybe an unwarranted assumption that all of those experiences and beings just totally have your good in mind. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3965.76s)]
*  And, you know, the traditional religions, the big religions disagree on things like the permanence of hell, right? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3974.76s)]
*  Like Hindus and Buddhists believe in hell. So do Christians. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3982.76s)]
*  Christians say once you're there, you're stuck. Hindus and Buddhists say, no, you know, maybe you can get out and cycle into a new life. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3986.76s)]
*  But one thing every religion has in common is a belief that your soul can get into really, really deep shit, really serious trouble. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=3992.76s)]
*  And one of the advantages of institutional religion is that it has a certain amount of experience, certain kinds of spiritual technologies, shall we say, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4003.76s)]
*  that are supposed to protect you from those things. And so and this is this is a larger point about the future, right? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4011.76s)]
*  Like the future of American religion right now is pretty open. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4018.76s)]
*  I do think we've come to the end of a period of secularization. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4023.76s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that Christianity is going to make some huge comeback, right? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4027.76s)]
*  And a lot of people are just going to be out there experimenting. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4031.76s)]
*  And in a way, parts of my argument, I think, affirm a spirit of experiment, right? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4036.76s)]
*  I don't expect everyone who is persuaded that God might exist to immediately join Opus Dei or any other. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4042.76s)]
*  I'm not I'm not in Opus Dei for the record. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4051.76s)]
*  But but yeah, so I don't I don't want to discourage experimentation, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4053.76s)]
*  but I do want to suggest that people should be careful and how American religious culture evolves may depend on how careful or not careful people end up being. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4058.76s)]
*  OK, the entire length of this conversation so far, we have been talking about two religions, Judaism and Christianity. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4071.76s)]
*  Unmentioned so far has been the religion that you know, and I'm saying this in a nonjudgmental way. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4080.76s)]
*  I think you can argue is one of the most charismatic, let's say, in our current moment, and that is Islam. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4087.76s)]
*  Would you be content in a world where Islam is the religion that people choose to become more religious inside of? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4094.76s)]
*  No, I wouldn't be content in such a world because I am a Christian. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4104.76s)]
*  And in spite of my, you know, attempts to be open and tolerant to religious experimentation, I do believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4110.76s)]
*  I do believe that the New Testament is the controlling revelation and that therefore Mohammed or his followers got some really important things wrong. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4119.76s)]
*  So content is not the right word. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4128.76s)]
*  But, you know, this this I know this came up at our at our great debate, right? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4131.76s)]
*  Because, of course, I was partnered with Ayon Hirsi Ali, who has become a Christian after a really devastating and horrific experience with fundamentalist Islam. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4136.76s)]
*  Growing up that pushed her, you know, all the way to atheism and hostility to religion. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4147.76s)]
*  So from her perspective, I think completely understandably, the idea of making this kind of generic case for religion doesn't make sense. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4154.76s)]
*  Because what if you end up with fundamentalist Islam? Right? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4162.76s)]
*  I certainly do not want to end up with fundamentalist Islam. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4165.76s)]
*  But if you said to me, you know, would I rather live in a world where more people practiced, you know, what what I what I see from my Muslim friends in the United States, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4170.76s)]
*  a kind of Americanized form of Islam that is not from my perspective fundamentalist is, you know, stands in some very complex relationship with modernity. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4183.76s)]
*  And again, I don't think I think Islam's evolution is a very complicated thing that I'm not fully qualified to comment on. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4195.76s)]
*  But like, would I rather live in a world? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4202.76s)]
*  Well, we'll just take an example, because the last podcast I did before yours was one with Shadi Hamid. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4205.76s)]
*  Right. Shadi Hamid is a a Muslim writer and thinker. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4210.76s)]
*  Right. Who co-hosts podcast Wisdom of Crowds. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4216.76s)]
*  Really smart guy. Would I rather live in a world populated by Shadi's than a world populated by atheists and agnostics? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4220.76s)]
*  I think the answer is easy. I would rather live in a world populated by Shadi's. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4229.76s)]
*  So there there certainly is some form of Islam that I consider closer to the truth about reality than hard atheism. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4233.76s)]
*  Again, you know, if someday there is a jihadist suicide bomber and people, you know, examine his body and find in his backpack a copy of Believe by Ross Southett. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4239.76s)]
*  Right. I mean, this this this will this will raise some questions about the impact of my of my arguments. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4251.76s)]
*  But I don't think I do know I don't think Islam is exempt from the broad generalizations that I make about the advantages of religion over non-belief, even if Islam has generated some particularly toxic and dangerous forms, especially in the last seventy five years. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4259.76s)]
*  OK, I think that when people who are skeptical of religion think about this conversation and this topic, they will think about, number one, the rise of Islamism. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4282.76s)]
*  And they will look at Europe. They will look at what's happening in parts of the Middle East. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4294.76s)]
*  And they will say, uh, that is proof to me that religion is not a great thing. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4300.76s)]
*  The thing they will look at closer to home. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4305.76s)]
*  And this is more recent, certainly more recently on my radar, probably for much longer on yours, since you're more inside this world is the rise of I don't even know what to call it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4307.76s)]
*  Christian nationalism, the rise of a kind of Christianity that many see as authoritarian that I think would maybe describe itself that way. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4319.76s)]
*  That is certainly anti-Semitic that is trying to upend things that I would say are at least I would argue are foundational American values. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4330.76s)]
*  I'm being like as broad as I can right now. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4342.76s)]
*  Are you worried about the rise of that? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4345.76s)]
*  And more importantly, I would love for you to explain why you think it is ascendant at this moment, maybe ascendant in a way that it hasn't been for a while. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4348.76s)]
*  I honestly don't think it's ascendant. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4359.76s)]
*  I think that it is a and I would separate this from fundamentalist Islam, which has actually been politically ascendant in lots of places in the late 20th and early 21st century. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4362.76s)]
*  I'm not at all trying to collapse. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4376.76s)]
*  No, no, no, I think I think there are certainly forms of Christianity that could theoretically establish, you know, establish societies that I would not wish to live in and would not wish anyone anyone else to live in. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4378.76s)]
*  And I'm not I'm not going to say that sort of very online anti-Semitic Christianity couldn't develop in that direction. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4390.76s)]
*  I think that its evolution right now in America is mostly a reflection of general Christian weakness. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4400.76s)]
*  And what do you mean by that Christian weakness? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4409.76s)]
*  Well, just that I mean, number one, Christianity has really been in decline. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4412.76s)]
*  Right. Christianity used to be the dominant religious institution in our society in different ways. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4415.76s)]
*  We talked about this earlier. It's been in decline. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4421.76s)]
*  And people want to want a story. Right. Why? Why has it declined? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4424.76s)]
*  Right. And one of the available stories is that it got, you know, way too soft and weak and unserious. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4428.76s)]
*  And and and I mean, I honestly, as a conservative Christian, I believe some version of that argument. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4437.76s)]
*  I do think that there are forms of Christianity that that answer to that description. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4443.76s)]
*  But obviously, there's that weakness leads critics of Christian decline to sometimes go further, much further. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4447.76s)]
*  Right. And say, well, the problem was we reconciled with the Jews. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4455.76s)]
*  You know, shouldn't shouldn't have done that. The problem is we. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4458.76s)]
*  The problem was Vatican to the problem. Yeah, it's a well, no. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4461.76s)]
*  But see, I have some skepticism about Vatican to. Right. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4464.76s)]
*  So there's there's there's a there's a whole set. We need to know additional episodes. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4467.76s)]
*  Not not not about the document on reconciliation with the Jews. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4472.76s)]
*  But I think the there is there is an open debate basically about why Christianity declined the way it did. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4479.76s)]
*  And inevitably, some of the participants in that debate stake out very extreme and toxic positions. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4486.76s)]
*  I don't see a lot of evidence that they are gaining profound influence outside of the online realm, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4493.76s)]
*  which doesn't make them undangerous. But it means that I don't expect sort of Christianity as it's practiced by most Christians in America in the next 30 or 40 years to be heavily influenced by those voices. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4502.76s)]
*  The form of Christianity that's most resilient in America is non denominational Protestantism, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4515.76s)]
*  which is like if you go into the suburbs and you see a Christian church that looks like a community center that has a name like Elevate. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4520.76s)]
*  Right. Like, you know, that that's that's it. Demographically, that's the form of Christianity that has been most resilient, more than my own Catholicism. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4528.76s)]
*  And and that's so that's that's one thing. The other thing is that these people are also in a kind of competition with post-Christian paganism. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4538.76s)]
*  Right. With like Bronze Age pervert style, Nietzschean sort of, you know, strength, vitality, vitalism, all these things that are that are actually important forces in the very online right. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4547.76s)]
*  And there I worry I do worry about that. I have, you know, strong doubts and arguments and disagreements with people in that in that realm. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4561.76s)]
*  But the Christian part of that realm seems to be pretty clearly the junior partner. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4573.76s)]
*  It's like it's like the Christian, you know, some Christian Christian trad bros or whatever are trying to play catch up and pick up some of the appeal of an Andrew Tate or a Bronze Age pervert or some or someone like that. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4577.76s)]
*  So I think that's bad. Right. But the primary but the primary energy there is more pagan than Christian. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4592.76s)]
*  I agree with you that they are the junior partners. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4600.76s)]
*  But then I also need to check myself when I try and be sanguine about it and say, hold on, isn't the whole story of the way wokeness came to conquer so much of the American left that it began in some weird Tumblr chats? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4602.76s)]
*  And then all of a sudden people were putting pronouns in their bios. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4617.76s)]
*  And already, you know, just this week, and I know this is, you know, this is coming out in Easter. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4620.76s)]
*  Who knows what who will have been on since then. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4625.76s)]
*  But Tucker Carlson has this guy on Andrew Iskier, who is, you know, an avowed Christian nationalist. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4627.76s)]
*  He has 20 Tucker has 20 million followers across social media. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4634.76s)]
*  Frankly, that's larger than the number of all Jewish people on the planet. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4637.76s)]
*  And this guy is saying things like, you know, only Christian should enjoy the blessings and benefits of our country and a lot of other truly detestable things that I'm not even going to bother getting into. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4641.76s)]
*  I mean, that to me, that is a significant development. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4652.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not going to tell you that you should not be concerned about. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4657.76s)]
*  I think Iskier is the Boniface option. Right. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4663.76s)]
*  So Rod Rod is different from the Benedict option instead of sort of rebuilding Christian culture in it is essentially punch. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4667.76s)]
*  Punch. Right. It's it's punch. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4678.76s)]
*  And yeah, I'm not I'm not going to try and persuade you that you shouldn't be concerned about that. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4680.76s)]
*  I just say I would say yes. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4686.76s)]
*  But I'm again, I'm primarily concerned about it in the context of what it means for individual Christian or Christian adjacent souls like more than I am that I think this is about to become ascended as a powerful political force. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4689.76s)]
*  And again, just because I think in terms of our macro level politics, pending an actual Christian revival, we're still a society that is hyper individualized, de-churched. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4710.76s)]
*  And it's just not a society like I mean, you know, if you look at the Trump administration right now, Trump administration is doing a lot of pretty wild things, right? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4724.76s)]
*  We're taping taping this episode right around the time of the Great Tariff Revolution. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4734.76s)]
*  Who knows what will come next? Right. Trump administration is acting in dramatic ways all over the place. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4739.76s)]
*  It's not acting dramatically in the service so far, it may change in the service of religious conservative causes, even the sort of mainstream ones like the pro-life movement to say nothing of the Boniface option or anything like that. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4744.76s)]
*  And again, I think that reflects the reality that Christianity is weak as a political force, even if it still has real cultural power, that weakness is generating extremism as weakness often does. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4758.76s)]
*  There may be a future where that extremism becomes politically dangerous, but right now it's more dangerous in terms of like, you know, you don't want your Christian son to become enamored of an anti-Semitic Christian figure. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4773.76s)]
*  And I think this goes generally to a point about the larger nature of our moment, right, which is that society in certain ways, like there's just a lot more weirdness everywhere right now that, you know, anyone who wants to find, you know, if you're on the right and you want to be freaked out about like radicalized Bernie bros or something, you go and find the Luigi mansion. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4787.76s)]
*  You can find the Luigi Mangione stands, right? And like, and this reflects this, you know, this kind of fragmentation that, you know, again, to start where, and where we started that the breaking of the scaffolding that holds up a normal liberal society, it's bad. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4816.76s)]
*  But it is, you shouldn't necessarily leap from that to saying, oh God, the people who love Luigi Mangione are about to organize into a mass movement that's going to, you know, install a Soviet dictatorship, right? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4834.76s)]
*  I think the same applies to some of the, you know, the hardest core, you know, Christian nationalist, anti-Semitic, what have you. They're dangerous in their place, but they aren't yet a political force to be reckoned with. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4849.76s)]
*  The other thing I've been thinking about ahead of this conversation, and I don't know if you'd call these people pagans or something else, but there is a sort of ideological movement afoot that see, and I think it's connected certainly to the rise of technology, AI, all of it. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4868.76s)]
*  A lot of these people are broadly, I would say, technologists, techno-optimist types who worship, I don't want to put it too bluntly, but feel like they're worshiping intelligence and worship IQ instead of worshiping God. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4889.76s)]
*  And it's a different, if Andrew Tate or, you know, Bronze Age pervert worship strength and the sun and things that we recognize as reliably pagan, there's another group of people that seems to believe that intelligence makes people worthy of respect. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4904.76s)]
*  I hope I'm phrasing this correctly. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4926.76s)]
*  Again, I mean, there, so there you're getting towards a group that I am actually concerned about, right? But it's there too, it's not, I think there is a vision of intelligence that is sort of religious-ish in nature and potentially incredibly important to our future. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4928.76s)]
*  But it's less the race and IQ bros than it is the people who think that they're building the machine god in Silicon Valley. And there's some overlap, right? Obviously, there are people who are building AI who are really interested in sort of eugenic ideas and so on, and there's overlap there. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4948.76s)]
*  But I do think if you're saying which weird idea, like we were just saying, there's a lot of weird ideas. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4972.76s)]
*  Which weird idea is keeping you up at night? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4977.76s)]
*  The weird idea that's keeping me up at night is the idea that the future of humanity is to, well, what did Elon Musk say just the other day, become like a biological bootstrap for a machine intelligence. This is not a direct quote, right? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4979.76s)]
*  But I found that quote disturbing, because I had actually thought of Musk as one of the people in Silicon Valley who, in all his weirdness, still seem to like human beings, right? He certainly seems to like to have human babies. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=4994.76s)]
*  But he's not, you know, he was sort of notable for, you know, the idea that like it's going to be human beings who go to Mars, not just, you know, Silicon creations and so on. But like, I don't know how to assess the actual prospects of artificial intelligence. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5006.76s)]
*  I do think in the world of artificial intelligence, there is a kind of potential overvaluation of what intelligence can do, where it's like if we just crank up the super intelligence, suddenly it will be able to do, to persuade people to do anything or to predict the future in all these ways. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5026.76s)]
*  And I'm not sure intelligence of any kind can get that far unless it becomes truly divine, right? But it is really notable that some of the richest and most powerful people in our country, responsible for technologies at the cutting edge of progress that a lot of people think are going to revolutionize our economy in the next 10 years, do seem to believe that human beings are going to be obsolete pretty soon. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5042.76s)]
*  And the best case scenario is we're going to merge with hyper intelligent machines. It's worth going and reading a blog post that Sam Altman of Open AI, not at all an unimportant person in American life, wrote, I think in 2017, I think it's called The Merge, right? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5069.76s)]
*  This is before it became super famous. But it's about like, you know, how do we relate to the successors, right? Our digital AI successors, right? And whether he's right or wrong, it's a vision of, it's notable that he holds his vision. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5087.76s)]
*  It's a vision of the future that I'm concerned about and would like to understand better. And I do think it's much more, much more important to worry about than either the Boniface option or the Luigi Mangione people or anyone in those in those categories. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5104.76s)]
*  What's at stake in this? You published a book, you're making an argument to me, you're making an argument on every podcast right now, saying that we need to believe. What is at stake if your argument doesn't win? If we don't follow the advice of the wise Ross Dauphit? What happens? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5121.76s)]
*  Well, I'll just go big on that one, right? So obviously, obviously, one answer is, you know, there are stakes for every human soul. As I said, whether you believe in an eternal hell or not, I think the collective religious wisdom of mankind is that souls can get lost. They're more likely to get lost if they aren't in some relationship with God. The more I lose the argument, the more souls potentially get lost. That's step one. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5142.76s)]
*  Step two is civilizational. Human beings, the book of Genesis begins with an admonition, fill the earth and subdue it. We've done that. We have reached a really interesting point in history from a religious point of view. And there's a really open question, I think, where we go next? Do we collapse? Do we go to the stars? Do we become transhuman? Do we merge with the machines and so on? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5166.76s)]
*  So I think it's a high stakes moment. And if God exists, and he has intentions for us, it's really important at a high stakes moment to take those intentions into account. Like, I really do think of people like Musk and Altman and so on as people in the contest for their literal souls is actually really important to the whole future of the human race. Again, if God exists. If God exists, it's a big question. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5189.76s)]
*  It's a big moment. And you want belief to win out over the alternatives. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5219.76s)]
*  Last question, Ross, this episode is coming out right around Easter. Easter, a time of hope and keeping faith even maybe in times that feel the void of it. I know it's about a lot of other things too. But you know, just some other details, just some other details. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5227.76s)]
*  Some small. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5244.76s)]
*  Just some small ones. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5245.76s)]
*  Yep. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5246.76s)]
*  What are you going to pray for this Easter? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5247.76s)]
*  Let's say two things. One is since I'm a newspaper columnist who has to write about the world and try to understand it, I will pray for understanding because I think that the world right now, you know, the world is always a bit beyond our comprehension, but I've been writing a column for 15 or 16 years now. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5251.76s)]
*  And the future has never felt quite as open and uncertain as it does right now. And I have a lot of questions, personal questions like what is important, right? Is the AI stuff really important or not? Is Donald Trump's and the tariffs and everything else important? Is supernatural stuff important? Are the UFOs, we didn't even talk about UFOs, right? Are they important? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5271.76s)]
*  Are they? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhGY9vi0Zo&t=5291.76s)]
