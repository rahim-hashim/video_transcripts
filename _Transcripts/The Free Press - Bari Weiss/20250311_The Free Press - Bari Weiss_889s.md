You may have never heard of Sarah Wynn-Williams, but that’s about to change.

She’s written a memoir about her nearly seven years at Facebook, the company that has since rebranded as Meta. In doing so, she’s become the company’s highest-ranking whistleblower.

Until around 72 hours ago, the book’s existence itself was a secret. Wynn-Williams, a onetime New Zealand diplomat, was effectively the company’s top envoy to governments around the world. She traveled extensively with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg—the company’s two top leaders during her time—and her experiences with them often read like pure comedy, a mix of Succession and The Office.

The book, however, is a lot more than that. It’s a shocking insider’s account of working at one of the world’s most powerful companies at the highest level, and the gap between the idealistic way it sold itself to its employees and the world.

It’s called “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.” And it coincides with the news that Wynn-Williams has filed an SEC complaint against the company, alleging that Zuckerberg agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the U.S. in the hopes that it would help convince Beijing to allow Facebook into China.

On today’s Honestly, Bari and Wynn-Williams discuss her bizarre experiences, her thoughts on the future of Facebook, the pushback she’s already received, and why she wrote this book—despite the risk of taking on a corporate behemoth like Meta.

# WHISTLEBLOWER: How Zuckerberg Folded to China’s Censorship Demands
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io)
*  Let's talk about China. So by 2014, Facebook had reached 1.3 billion active monthly users. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=0.0s)]
*  And as we've discussed, it's a company. The goal is to grow, to increase shareholder value. And [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=9.76s)]
*  the way to do that, it became clear, was to get to more countries, including some countries that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=15.44s)]
*  are hostile to the very things that Facebook's mission is about. Connectivity, transparency. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=21.92s)]
*  These are countries that are hostile to basic liberties and of course human rights. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=28.88s)]
*  And here's what you write. You say, I watched hopelessly as they sucked up to authoritarian [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=33.6s)]
*  regimes like China's and casually misled the public. Tell us about what you mean by that, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=38.56s)]
*  and then we're going to get into some of the details of China. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=46.0s)]
*  Sure. So the standard line that the company has always given is that they were studying [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=49.36s)]
*  and learning China. The Chinese market today to matter is worth $18 billion. If you look at [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=56.88s)]
*  their most recent 10 K filing, which is, you know, they say the Chinese market is worth $18 billion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=66.56s)]
*  Two years ago, that was $7 billion. So this company, its current valuation and its future growth [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=73.36s)]
*  are both completely dependent on China. And for some reason, some reason being that the company [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=83.92s)]
*  has not been upfront about its operations, people don't understand that. And if they don't understand [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=90.08s)]
*  that, they don't understand the trade-offs and the actual orientation of the company. And they've done [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=95.2s)]
*  a wonderful job of letting this idea that they're, you know, they have no engagement at China take [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=100.48s)]
*  hold when that's not the truth. Okay. In 2014, and this email is included in the book, Mark sends [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=108.0s)]
*  an email, Zuckerberg, explaining what he views as the company's three-year plan to have Facebook [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=116.08s)]
*  fully operational in China. And here's just part of what that email said. I wanted to provide some [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=122.32s)]
*  context on why I believe it is time to take this more seriously. In our mission to connect the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=127.36s)]
*  world, there have always been a few difficult problems we've always said we'd get to eventually [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=132.16s)]
*  connecting those who can't afford the internet, building satellites for those who don't have any [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=136.56s)]
*  connectivity and connecting countries where we're blocked like China. We've now made progress on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=140.32s)]
*  every single other major problem. And the last one on the list is China. By the end of year three, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  we should have hopefully built the relationships that would enable Facebook to operate in China [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=151.6s)]
*  as well. And you say that there's a lot that's missing in Mark's email. Things like acknowledgement [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=156.16s)]
*  of the moral complexity, this is you, of working in an authoritarian country. There's no question [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=163.84s)]
*  in Mark's email of should we operate in China or how do we manage the inevitable moral dilemmas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=169.28s)]
*  that are sure to come. China is, in Mark's eyes, just the end of a to-do list. Help us get into the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  mind of Mark Zuckerberg at the time. Do you think that it's just naiveté? Do you think that it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=183.68s)]
*  callousness? How do you understand the psychology of the person that is writing this email for the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=191.2s)]
*  three-year plan in China? Because I don't think Facebook is at all unique in this regard. I think [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=201.44s)]
*  that there are many, many, many companies throughout Silicon Valley and certainly throughout [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=207.2s)]
*  America that are writing similar things at the time. Take us into their mindset. How do you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  understand why what's missing from that email is missing? So the way that I experienced Mark was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=221.04s)]
*  that he looks at the world as if it's a board game. Like it's a game of risk. As if he's an emperor of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  the board game and there's this giant piece missing. And it becomes his white whale. It becomes the one [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=234.48s)]
*  thing that he hasn't been able to make work and the one thing that he knows would fundamentally [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=241.44s)]
*  change the trajectory of his business. The scandal here and what you catalogue in the book [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=247.76s)]
*  is the various ways that Facebook considered appeasing the CCP so that Facebook could enter [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  China. There are a lot of details in the book, some of which are frankly a little bit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=261.2s)]
*  labyrinthine so people should read it. But let me try and summarise the key points. You [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=266.56s)]
*  allege that Facebook was willing to store user data in China. You allege that they were willing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=272.88s)]
*  to hand over this data to the CCP, including for users in Hong Kong, which was not under Chinese [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=278.16s)]
*  control at the time. You allege that they were willing to put in place a chief editor to decide [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=283.76s)]
*  what could stay up, like what was kosher and what wasn't. You allege that they were willing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=289.6s)]
*  to conduct surveillance through a Chinese partner on the ground and willing to shut down the site [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  during times of quote social unrest. I just want to read, I want the listener to understand [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=300.32s)]
*  some of the specific offerings that were up for consideration or at least were being discussed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=307.44s)]
*  within Facebook that you write about in your book. So bear with me because they're your words. It's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=314.0s)]
*  weird to have them read back to you, but I think it's useful for people listening to this. Under [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=318.88s)]
*  direction from Mark, Facebook assembled a large team, including some of its most senior and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=323.12s)]
*  respected engineers, to work up what the Chinese Communist Party wanted. They started building new [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=328.48s)]
*  censorship tools for Hony, and this is sort of their partner on the ground, to scour through [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=334.48s)]
*  people's messages and posts and convert everything into simplified Chinese. Here's more. Facebook [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  would build facial recognition, photo tagging, and other moderation tools to facilitate Chinese [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  censorship. The tools would enable Facebook's partner on the ground, Hony, and the Chinese [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=352.0s)]
*  government to review all the public posts and private messages of Chinese users, including messages [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=356.96s)]
*  they get from users outside China. Here's the last one. There would be an emergency switch to block [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=363.44s)]
*  any specific region in China from interacting with Chinese and non-Chinese users. Also, an extreme [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  emergency content switch to remove viral content originating inside or outside China during times [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=377.76s)]
*  of potential unrest, including significant anniversaries like the anniversary of Tiananmen [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=384.4s)]
*  Square. Their censorship tools would automatically examine any content with more than 10,000 views [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=389.44s)]
*  by Chinese users. Once this virality counter got built, the documents say that Facebook deployed [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=395.52s)]
*  it in Hong Kong and Taiwan, where it's been running on every post. So what you're essentially [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  describing here is like a scenario where Facebook is actively building censorship tools tailored to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=406.32s)]
*  the demands of the CCP. Right. And even more to the point, the CCP were testing Facebook on these [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=413.44s)]
*  tools. So when any other government, including the US government, would say, hey, how does facial [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=424.08s)]
*  recognition work? Or how does photo tagging work? I would have these conversations with other [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=430.56s)]
*  governments. We'd say, sorry, we can't tell you that. That's information that's only for us. We're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=435.6s)]
*  not going to sit you down and explain to you how Facebook Live works or how photo tagging works. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=441.36s)]
*  And yet, for the CCP, there were these detailed briefings showing how the technology worked, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  testing of it to make sure it met their censorship specifications. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  And beyond that, there were sort of general briefings on AI or infrastructure, the sort of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=462.24s)]
*  things that would never be provided to any other government. Are you suggesting that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=468.32s)]
*  the CCP could sort of use these tools on non-Facebook products or simply that Facebook [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=473.92s)]
*  was sort of being very open kimono with the Chinese government? I mean, they were explaining [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=479.52s)]
*  exactly how this technology worked, which was being built in a white glove service for the CCP. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  How many people inside Facebook knew about the development of these kinds of tools or knew about [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=494.56s)]
*  the kind of dialogue that was happening between the CCP and Facebook? It's a really interesting [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=501.52s)]
*  question. Again, they weren't upfront with the vast majority of employees. I think if you're [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=507.52s)]
*  someone who works at a company like this, that's not great. You shouldn't feel great about the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=512.88s)]
*  company holding back its top priority from its employees. For those that did know about this and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  did know about Facebook's aims to get into the Chinese market, how was it discussed among those [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  people? You're making the case in the book, to be crude about it, that Facebook was actively [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=531.28s)]
*  strengthening a surveillance state in order to get purchase in that market. But presumably, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=537.68s)]
*  that's not the way it was being talked about. How was it being justified and discussed? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=544.88s)]
*  It was being discussed as sort of this, I think the vast majority of people working on it thought [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=548.16s)]
*  it was like a high priority project, something the CEO wants. I think there was sort of a lot of, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=556.24s)]
*  most people got excited about it and felt like they were in on a secret and in on a CEO's top [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=564.56s)]
*  priority. That was my sense of it. Would the steel man argument of it be something like, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=570.72s)]
*  look, China is obviously an authoritarian regime. It's obviously an extraordinarily [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  different country than America and not one any of us would choose, a regime any of us at Facebook [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=585.12s)]
*  would choose to live under. But better they have a tool like Facebook, which allows a lot of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=590.88s)]
*  but better they have a tool like Facebook, which allows a level of connectivity than not having [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=596.72s)]
*  anything at all. In other words, was there a way that they justified it to themselves based on [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=602.56s)]
*  essentially, I don't want to say human rights grounds, but the argument that better to have [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=608.8s)]
*  this tool than nothing at all. But I think if you take that the next step, so there was knowledge [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=613.28s)]
*  at the company because someone had to actually implement this, like someone actually had to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=619.04s)]
*  execute on the censorship tool. And when they considered that, they weigh the leadership, weigh [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=625.52s)]
*  the pros and cons and list out like the pros of us operating this, and they're like more direct [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=633.68s)]
*  communication with the government, a number of other things. And when it gets to the cons, they're [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=642.64s)]
*  like, they know that the first is one of the most extraordinary Microsoft Office track changes I've [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=648.24s)]
*  ever seen in my life. But like the original drafting was, you know, we would be responsible [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=655.84s)]
*  for torture, you know, death. And then there's a track change. And then it's like, we would be [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=661.04s)]
*  responsible for working with a country that does not respect international human rights. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=668.08s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK I just want to be really clear here for the listener and for the people who [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=671.84s)]
*  certainly have not read your book because it comes out today. Facebook in this context is not in China. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=676.4000000000001s)]
*  They are internally weighing the decision about whether or not they should enter China. And so [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  the document you're referring to is a document you come across where Facebook's China team is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=688.08s)]
*  basically talking out loud to themselves. They are weighing the pros and cons of what it would mean [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  for Facebook to do the surveillance on behalf of China themselves. And one of the cons that's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDffkpJ6io&t=700.1600000000001s)]
