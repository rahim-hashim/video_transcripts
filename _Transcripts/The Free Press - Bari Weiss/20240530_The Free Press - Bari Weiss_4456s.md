# Full Interview: Nellie Bowles Knows Why So Many Progressives Lost Their Minds—She Almost Did, Too
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI)
*  Nellie Boles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=0.0s)]
*  Very wise. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1.0s)]
*  Well, we are here for an auspicious occasion, which is the home birth of our child. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2.0s)]
*  That's two months away. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  But you birthed something else, which is this incredible new book, your first book, which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=10.74s)]
*  obviously I am a hardcore wife guy and I'm hopelessly biased. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=16.12s)]
*  But I think that this book, Mourning After the Revolution, Dispatches from the Wrong [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=20.54s)]
*  Side of History, yes that is the full title, is incredible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=23.6s)]
*  I happen to have sort of like lived alongside you for the whole gestation of the book. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=28.94s)]
*  And the book sort of begins where our relationship did. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=35.5s)]
*  And it's just really funny and emotional to sit here in our home with our baby in the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=39.02s)]
*  other room, another baby on the way, and think back to the person that I met in 2018, really [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=45.5s)]
*  before our baby as the revolution, as you call it, was beginning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=53.38s)]
*  So let's kind of go back in time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=57.14s)]
*  It's 2018. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=60.1s)]
*  We met in the New York Times cafeteria for the first time on the fifth floor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=61.1s)]
*  Who were you back then in 2018 when I met you and you were a reporter at the New York Times? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=64.5s)]
*  God, it's funny to go back all the way there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=70.02s)]
*  I was a very confident young reporter at the Times, rising up, doing really well and having [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=74.52s)]
*  a lot of fun. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=83.14s)]
*  I had started as a tech reporter in San Francisco. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=84.14s)]
*  I was out in New York meeting with editors because I'd started doing bigger features, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=87.7s)]
*  features that touched on politics and bigger topics. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=93.58s)]
*  I was having a blast. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=97.5s)]
*  Whatever struck my mind as interesting or whatever my curiosity kind of landed on that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=99.9s)]
*  day, I would pitch it and editors would say yes and I was off to the races and doing very [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=105.22s)]
*  well at the job that I always had wanted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=110.62s)]
*  Before I got the job, I would look in the mirror. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  When I was talking to the woman who had become my editor and who was a great boss, I would [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  look in the mirror and I would say, hi, Nellie Bowles from the New York Times. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  Hi, it's Nellie Bowles with the New York Times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  Nellie, New York Times. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=128.38s)]
*  Yeah, calling for ... I would rehearse this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  I was obsessed with this place. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=134.74s)]
*  I believed in the literature of it and in the slogans as almost religious gospel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  I believed in them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=144.18s)]
*  When they said the truth is hard, I thought, yeah, the truth is hard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=146.34s)]
*  All of that stuff, all of the beautiful romance we have around the life of a journalist, I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=152.54s)]
*  really believed in it and I saw it as a calling. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=161.3s)]
*  I think at the time it was really hard for you to imagine that the New York Times was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=164.78s)]
*  anything other but those slogans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=169.5s)]
*  I remember when we met saying to you, maybe second or third date, this is going to have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=172.34s)]
*  an impact on your career and you looked at me like I was kind of crazy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=178.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, I thought you were crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=183.46s)]
*  Basically, my arc at the paper was I went from a few very easy, successful years to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=185.46s)]
*  then towards the end of 2019, maybe middle of 2019, as what we now can see is a revolution [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=193.54s)]
*  was rising. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=202.78s)]
*  It resisted having a name. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=204.46s)]
*  Of course, I hate the term the woke movement or whatever because it's so flattening. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=206.14s)]
*  I think early days of woke were actually kind of cool and interesting. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=213.1s)]
*  But whatever you want to call the revolution that we all just have seen over the last five [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=215.98s)]
*  years, when that started coming, I wanted to cover parts of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=220.38s)]
*  I wanted to report on it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=227.5s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=229.5s)]
*  I had been being rewarded for doing reporting on really interesting moments that were happening [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=230.5s)]
*  and finding interesting characters. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=236.26s)]
*  And this was really interesting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=237.62s)]
*  I was becoming kind of obsessed with what was going on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=239.5s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=243.22s)]
*  You would see groups of anti-fascists taking over a neighborhood in Seattle. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=244.22s)]
*  All of this stuff was going on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=249.3s)]
*  At the same time, I met you and we were falling in love. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  And these two things started making it impossible for me within the paper. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=257.18s)]
*  It was both my curiosity about kind of avenues of reporting that weren't going to necessarily [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=265.66s)]
*  help, let's say, Joe Biden's reelection chances or something like that, which, yeah, we'll [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=271.74s)]
*  get to that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=277.02s)]
*  And starting to date you, that kind of simultaneously then all of a sudden made life much harder [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=279.58s)]
*  for me there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=284.82s)]
*  I had an editor, a great guy, say to me in the office, in front of a group of colleagues, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=286.18s)]
*  all of us having a drink, I can't believe you would go on a date with Barry Weiss. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=293.78s)]
*  And I was like trying to laugh. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=299.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=300.14s)]
*  Like, it's an editor. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=301.14s)]
*  And he said, she's a Nazi. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  She's a fucking Nazi. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=305.62s)]
*  Straight to my face. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=308.3s)]
*  And I was like, what did you think in that moment? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=309.86s)]
*  Because you didn't tell me about that at all at the time because you didn't want to upset [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=317.66s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=318.66s)]
*  Yeah, I told you like, what, a couple months later? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=319.66s)]
*  In the moment, I was getting a little bit used to people saying really inappropriate [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=323.1s)]
*  things to me about you and about my curiosity about some of these reporting topics. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=328.98s)]
*  I thought I want to just get out of the situation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=335.26s)]
*  I want to just like get him to move on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=336.98s)]
*  And he really was on it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=339.38s)]
*  But I was embarrassed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=342.06s)]
*  I was super embarrassed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=346.06s)]
*  I didn't want to be on the outs. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=349.06s)]
*  And I didn't want to not please the editors around me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=351.22s)]
*  I wanted to please them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=355.68s)]
*  This was the only place I ever thought I would be. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=357.42s)]
*  So it was sort of like, this is a person I'm going to have for the rest of my life as an [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=359.42s)]
*  editor. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=368.94s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=369.94s)]
*  Like I was panicked maybe? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=370.94s)]
*  And so, and also I didn't want to get him in trouble because I really liked him and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  I like him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=380.3s)]
*  Like, and that's what's so crazy maybe. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=381.3s)]
*  I think like the theme that comes through in everything that you do is you are just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=382.94s)]
*  total openness and curiosity about the world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=388.42s)]
*  And it was weirdly that curiosity that became your Achilles heel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=392.1s)]
*  Well, it does always get me in trouble. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=397.06s)]
*  Even now it gets me in trouble. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=399.06s)]
*  I can't help myself with it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=400.06s)]
*  But the thing that shifted really, as after the Nazi comment, it was almost explicit that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=402.18s)]
*  the coverage at the Times and the coverage at every mainstream liberal publication had [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=414.74s)]
*  to explicitly help Joe Biden's reelection. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=421.82s)]
*  And it became like, it has to help the party. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=425.12s)]
*  And that used to be maybe subtly, or journalists have always been liberal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=429.94s)]
*  It's not like, that's not a surprise. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=433.3s)]
*  Like I thought my politics fit in just great. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=435.22s)]
*  But it became much more explicit and stated. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  So one example I really remember, and this is a chapter in your new book, was during [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=445.1s)]
*  the rioting of the summer of 2020. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=451.74s)]
*  There were peaceful BLM protests, but then of course there were violent riots and violent [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=454.18s)]
*  riots that left whole cities, or at least parts of cities, destroyed in their wake. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=459.04s)]
*  And you were a business reporter at the time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  And I remember you saying, this is a really interesting business story. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=465.68s)]
*  I want to go to Kenosha. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=469.62s)]
*  Because the whole story that was being told is, oh, all those small business owners have [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=471.3s)]
*  insurance, it's no big deal. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=474.98s)]
*  And you were skeptical about that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=476.94s)]
*  Tell us about the decision to go and report that story. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=479.1s)]
*  And then what happened, because this is really what I remember, in the wake of you coming [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=481.3s)]
*  back with the story that you did. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=484.98s)]
*  So I had been wanting to find different underreported bits of all the little explosions we were seeing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=488.0s)]
*  around the country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=496.68s)]
*  Kenosha was a really interesting one, because in Kenosha, the wealthy white commercial district [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=498.62s)]
*  all was very well insured, and had a sort of commercial business association that when [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=504.46s)]
*  they saw the protests turning into riots and turning more violent, they boarded up immediately. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=509.94s)]
*  It was all kind of spic and span done. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=515.8199999999999s)]
*  I think they lost one business down there, and it was pretty tight. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=517.74s)]
*  And if they did lose a business, they had insurance. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=522.34s)]
*  The neighborhood that ended up being burned was the multicultural, primarily not white, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=525.3s)]
*  poor business district. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=530.74s)]
*  And there, all of the small businesses were underinsured. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=533.78s)]
*  We're talking about little cell phone shops and this and that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=538.4599999999999s)]
*  They were all vastly underinsured, because most people aren't thinking about catastrophic [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  loss, total loss. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  They're thinking maybe someone will steal a cell phone case or two, and we'll have to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=547.02s)]
*  get that reimbursed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=551.06s)]
*  But they're not thinking catastrophic loss. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=552.06s)]
*  And so the district that was burned was this poor minority-owned district. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=554.54s)]
*  And the city was scrambling to try to figure out how to pay for the rebuild. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=559.42s)]
*  And so I wanted to go and see with my own eyes what happened there. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=565.62s)]
*  I wanted to see what I'd only seen through super partisan media. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=570.66s)]
*  So at the time, the only media coverage out of these cities was either right-wing media [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=575.62s)]
*  that was saying, like, Antifa destroyed the entire city of Kenosha, like all caps. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=581.9s)]
*  You've seen the YouTubes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=588.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=589.82s)]
*  And then left-wing media that's like peaceful protest. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=590.82s)]
*  The fiery but peaceful CNN. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=594.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=596.62s)]
*  And I was sort of going crazy with that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=597.62s)]
*  I was like, what's actually going on? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=599.22s)]
*  So I pitched that great business story. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  I go, I come back with that story. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=602.46s)]
*  And basically, I mean, it sounds so petty now, but it's basically slow-rolled. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=604.98s)]
*  It's basically that we're not going to have space to run a story about what happened in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=610.36s)]
*  Kenosha. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=615.32s)]
*  We're not going to have space. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=616.32s)]
*  And more than explicit lies about what was happening in 2020, how the mainstream media [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=617.32s)]
*  controlled the narrative was by not covering it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=624.84s)]
*  That was the most important thing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=629.72s)]
*  It was to ignore it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=630.72s)]
*  And it was to all of us collectively agreed to ignore it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=632.32s)]
*  We were on different sides of the paper, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=635.32s)]
*  So I was on the opinion side. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=637.72s)]
*  We were on the news side. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=639.12s)]
*  But we saw different versions of the same story, which is things that adhered to the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=640.6s)]
*  convenient, politically helpful narrative sort of sailed in. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=645.92s)]
*  And anything that didn't was scrutinized, caveated, slow-rolled, et cetera. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=650.92s)]
*  Now Kenosha was one story I really remember you doing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=656.2s)]
*  The other story I really remember now was the story that you did about, I don't remember [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=659.68s)]
*  if the end of the day the name was Chas or Chop. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=664.34s)]
*  Chas Chop. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=666.84s)]
*  It says autonomous zone in Seattle. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=667.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  Would you read from a little part of that chapter? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  Why I would. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  This was a time when the mainstream media toyed with the idea that righteous vigilantes [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  were good, very good. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  And only the weak need would question whether the protest should have a little edge, that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  frisson of danger. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=685.2s)]
*  People's hearts are always in the right place. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  The protest was fiery but peaceful is how a now famous CNN chiron described one Antifa [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  outing. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=694.6800000000001s)]
*  The correspondent was reporting against a backdrop of raging fires as the word peaceful [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=695.68s)]
*  sat on the screen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=699.16s)]
*  The scene looked comically unpeaceful. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't have time to finger wag at protesters about property, said Black Lives Matter co-founder [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=702.04s)]
*  Alicia Garza. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  Ignoring destruction of a local business became official policy for New York-based media. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, wrote a meditation at the height of the protest [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=714.0s)]
*  asking who really is the agitator here? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=717.8s)]
*  He cites Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=721.04s)]
*  Even looting, King insisted, is an act of catharsis, a form of shocking the white community [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=723.08s)]
*  by abusing property rights. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=727.4000000000001s)]
*  Then King quoted Victor Hugo to deepen his point, if a soul is left in the darkness, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  sins will be committed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  The guilty one is not he who commits the sin but he who causes the darkness. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=735.2s)]
*  That's a kicker to Remnick's essay. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=739.48s)]
*  NPR held a friendly Q&A about the importance of riots and looting as a protest tactic with [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=741.36s)]
*  the author of a book titled simply In Defense of Looting. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=746.48s)]
*  Nicole Hannah Jones, the creator of the 1619 Project, and by then the most famous American [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=750.16s)]
*  reporter agreed, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=754.48s)]
*  Anyway, Antifa itself was just fun. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  Masked vigilantes have always saved the world, became the media's line. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=772.8s)]
*  Another prominent Times reporter tweeted, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=776.44s)]
*  Writer and director W. Camus Bell did a special on Antifa for CNN. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  Antifa is short for anti-fascist, he said. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=788.48s)]
*  Picture a table. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  On one side of the table is Hitler and Mussolini, and on the other side is the popular performer [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=792.2800000000001s)]
*  Rafi. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=796.84s)]
*  Which side of the table are you sitting on? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=797.84s)]
*  I'm with Rafi. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=799.72s)]
*  In a video called The Real Antifa, the Lincoln Project, a lobbying group for Democrats spearheaded [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=801.64s)]
*  by former Republicans, showed clips of World War II soldiers while a gravelly voiced narrator [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=806.76s)]
*  read, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=811.52s)]
*  Or perhaps another way of putting it, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=819.08s)]
*  Destroying small businesses was good. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=831.64s)]
*  Small businesses aren't unionized. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=833.92s)]
*  Small businesses aren't accountable. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=835.92s)]
*  All those little burned out shops were part of the structural problem. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=837.76s)]
*  Bhaskar Soankara, president of the nation, a major leftist magazine, said essentially [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=840.92s)]
*  that it was bad tactics but good politics to end small businesses. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=845.84s)]
*  So if by attack small businesses, you mean encourage the looting of them, sure, that's [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=850.12s)]
*  technically counterproductive. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  But we should aim to undermine small business owners with pro-worker legislation slash unions [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=857.2s)]
*  and to reconstitute them as worker-controlled state firms or co-ops. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  A writer from the progressive magazine Jacobin joined in. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=867.48s)]
*  We shouldn't fetishize mom and pops. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=870.96s)]
*  They offer lower wages, skimpier benefits, and inferior labor protections. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=873.08s)]
*  Delighted by the warm press reception, random members of Antifa started releasing their [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  and appearing on news shows, their faces backlit to keep anonymity. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=883.12s)]
*  The use of violence is a tactic of how we keep our communities safe, an anonymous member [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=887.36s)]
*  told Nightline. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=892.16s)]
*  The whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable, said Congresswoman Alexandria [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=893.16s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=898.0s)]
*  A sleep magazine headline read, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=899.0s)]
*  Nonviolence is an important tool for protests, but so is violence. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=902.12s)]
*  The rhetoric at the time was, at best, heated, even occasionally exceeding the ever polite [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=907.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=912.84s)]
*  One prominent activist and media darling tweeted at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=913.84s)]
*  I am going to be the person who watches the life leave your eyes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  So there's hardcore. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=924.0s)]
*  I mean, the rhetoric was insane. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=926.2s)]
*  The rhetoric was wild. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=929.28s)]
*  And now, of course, it's being memory hold. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=931.84s)]
*  All of it's being memory hold. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, obviously, the stuff around Antifa and people pretend like, because at the time, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=935.9200000000001s)]
*  the context for that section is people were pretending Antifa wasn't real. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=941.52s)]
*  And the media's job was pretend Antifa wasn't real. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=946.12s)]
*  And if Antifa was real, it was good. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=949.5600000000001s)]
*  And that was sort of the move with constant things, right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=952.74s)]
*  It wasn't just about Antifa. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=957.88s)]
*  No, it was all of it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=958.88s)]
*  The same rhetorical move is the thing doesn't exist, the thing doesn't exist, the thing [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=959.92s)]
*  doesn't exist. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  But when it's proven that it exists, it was good. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=967.24s)]
*  Now, you, unlike many people, actually saw Antifa with your own eyes in many of the stories [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=968.24s)]
*  that you did, whether it was in Portland, if I recall, and then, of course, in this [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=974.92s)]
*  chas-chopped Seattle autonomous zone. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=979.12s)]
*  In that summer, a group of anti-fascists took over a neighborhood of Seattle. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=983.52s)]
*  It actually was the Gayborhood, the gay neighborhood. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=988.52s)]
*  And they set up borders. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=991.28s)]
*  They installed their own sort of security system. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=994.24s)]
*  And they said, within these blocks are no police and no ambulances and no outsiders [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=998.04s)]
*  without our permission. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1004.88s)]
*  This is a new city. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1006.32s)]
*  This is a new land. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the autonomous zone. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1008.6800000000001s)]
*  The mayor of Seattle endorsed it, embraced it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1010.04s)]
*  She supplied it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1013.44s)]
*  She brought in porta-potties and brought in fences to help them build their borders of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1016.52s)]
*  their new city. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  She thought it was kind of fun. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  And I mean, needless to say, all of her text messages from that period mysteriously disappeared [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1025.6s)]
*  and were just accidentally deleted afterwards. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1032.24s)]
*  And she has promised better data retention, better record retention methods in the future. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1035.48s)]
*  But yeah, she embraced it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1041.6s)]
*  And so what was happening at that moment was that we were being told that the Black Lives [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1043.96s)]
*  Matter protests had no Antifa element and no sort of violent element, that they were [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1049.48s)]
*  all just peaceful. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
*  And any part that was violent was probably a conservative right-wing white supremacist [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1056.64s)]
*  trying to undermine the BLM movement. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1063.52s)]
*  And so that was kind of the explanation for what you were seeing on TV. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  And what you were seeing was cities lit on fire and chaos and violence and also beautiful [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1071.2s)]
*  protests and also peaceful things. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1077.92s)]
*  It was the mix, but it was a mix that included violence. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1081.8000000000002s)]
*  And Seattle gave away the lie a little bit because there you saw the complete and public [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1085.0400000000002s)]
*  alliance of Antifa and BLM. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1093.0800000000002s)]
*  Now what is Antifa and why is it interesting and why is it important to say it was entwined? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1095.64s)]
*  It's because Antifa believes in violent protest and the frijon of more violence, the idea [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1101.08s)]
*  that we're not going to just talk about our goals. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1108.72s)]
*  Antifa brings that in and says, this is now on the table. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1113.72s)]
*  BLM had a softer reputation. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1117.72s)]
*  It was nonviolent marches. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1120.28s)]
*  It was being embraced by corporate America, glossy magazines. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  And so... [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1127.3999999999999s)]
*  Every major brand. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  Antifa was tricky for the brand, but it was very useful for the actual tangible actions [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1131.0400000000002s)]
*  and to make that protest a little bit fiery, which made it a little more dramatic and made [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1136.52s)]
*  it a little, you know, give it that energy. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  And so at the time, basically the mainstream press, including the New York Times, was openly [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1144.92s)]
*  lying about the connection between these groups. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1150.48s)]
*  But I went to these places. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1153.76s)]
*  I went to Seattle. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1155.68s)]
*  I went to Portland. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1156.68s)]
*  I went to Kenosha. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1157.68s)]
*  The alliance was completely real. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1158.68s)]
*  They were all working together as one movement for that period of time. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1161.24s)]
*  And how do I know... [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1167.28s)]
*  It's Antifa. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1169.64s)]
*  Antifa, they say they're a leaderless, autonomous movement. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1170.64s)]
*  They all dress alike. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1174.4s)]
*  They carry guns. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1175.8400000000001s)]
*  They mask their faces. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1177.96s)]
*  It's a so-called leaderless movement that is extraordinarily disciplined and extraordinarily [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  organized. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1188.92s)]
*  I remember... [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1189.92s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons that these stories that you did, whether about Kenosha [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1191.24s)]
*  or Seattle, were so complicated is the caricatured two-dimensional story we were all meant to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1195.4s)]
*  believe was that these protests were made up of marginalized minority populations and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1202.04s)]
*  they were fighting the man, you know, to put it in their language, you know, the cis-het [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1208.16s)]
*  white heteronormative, blah, blah, blah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  We could throw in more jargon there. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1216.4s)]
*  But actually what your stories revealed is that it was so much more complicated. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1218.2s)]
*  And the character that brought that to life for me was this Muslim, gay, cafe owner whose [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1222.2s)]
*  cafe unfortunately happened to be located in the center of this autonomous zone. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about him and what you discovered through his story. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1234.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  So basically when I was in Seattle, I ended up spending time with a few small business [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1238.8000000000002s)]
*  owners, including Faisal Khan. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1243.84s)]
*  And he basically described to me how, because he had joined a lawsuit against the city, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1246.84s)]
*  to say to the city, you guys either owe me some cash back for the broken windows, you [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1256.84s)]
*  got to move the borders of your new autonomous zone because delivery vehicles can no longer [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1264.76s)]
*  come in to pick up Uber Eats orders or something. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1269.4199999999998s)]
*  My business is crashing. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1273.1s)]
*  My windows are being smashed. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1274.98s)]
*  It is a disaster. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1276.74s)]
*  The city has to help, right? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1277.98s)]
*  So a bunch of business owners had gotten together and done this lawsuit. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1279.26s)]
*  Because he had joined that then, then he was targeted more. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1282.1399999999999s)]
*  And targeted, I mean, we're talking about young white men with large guns who were very [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1285.1799999999998s)]
*  intimidating and very scary. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1295.3s)]
*  And it wasn't crazy to be scared of them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1297.9399999999998s)]
*  They would smash your glass again as soon as you replace it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1299.9s)]
*  And they were marching around at night. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1303.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, you would see these shaky videos that were coming out of these autonomous zones, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1305.0600000000002s)]
*  Seattle in particular, at night. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1309.42s)]
*  And it was people opening the trunks of cars, handing out long guns to different sort of [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1311.3000000000002s)]
*  new security operators. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1318.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, where you have a vacuum of power, what do you think is going to happen? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1319.8600000000001s)]
*  So when I was there, I'm wandering around, I'm hanging out, I'm kind of chatting with [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1323.74s)]
*  business owners, what's going on, guys? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1328.26s)]
*  And you've got a couple different security forces happening. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1330.78s)]
*  You've got these kind of really sweet BLM security team who wander around and they're [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1333.58s)]
*  like, we're with BLM. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1340.58s)]
*  You've got the paid security. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1343.94s)]
*  And they are wearing bulletproof vests. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1347.22s)]
*  And they're like the guys who guard banks, basically, who are there. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1351.18s)]
*  And they're walking around and they're saying, you pay me a little bit. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1354.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, everyone, the BLM guys were also asking to be paid. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1356.94s)]
*  The paid security was saying, pay me and I'll guard you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1359.8200000000002s)]
*  And then you have... [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1363.42s)]
*  So it's like basically Seattle's versions of warlords. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1364.42s)]
*  And people are like paying off... [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1367.02s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1368.5800000000002s)]
*  And maybe you have to pay off a few of these different security teams. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1369.8200000000002s)]
*  And then the third team is the Antifa team, who are these sort of squirrely looking, very [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1373.66s)]
*  pale white guys wandering around, also saying they're providing security and they're monitoring. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1379.9s)]
*  They kind of monitor me the closest. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1385.62s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, where you have a vacuum, you have all these groups. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1387.9799999999998s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1390.6599999999999s)]
*  But as a reporter, it was so rich. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1391.6599999999999s)]
*  Here you are in an American city, in a progressive American city. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1395.7399999999998s)]
*  And there's basically different warlords being paid off by people like Faisal Khan. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1399.1s)]
*  And this is being portrayed by the local government as Coachella in the city. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1405.26s)]
*  But it turns. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1412.9799999999998s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1413.9799999999998s)]
*  I mean, basically, people were shot. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1416.58s)]
*  And one young person was shot. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1419.3799999999999s)]
*  Chaz stayed open. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1422.6999999999998s)]
*  And then another young person was shot and died. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1424.4199999999998s)]
*  And then Chaz, after that, was shot down. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1426.6999999999998s)]
*  The father of that young man has a lawsuit against the city. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1431.3799999999999s)]
*  And he alleges that basically the kid was put on a folding table and basically bled [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1435.78s)]
*  and then finally was thrown into a car and brought to the hospital. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1443.22s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1448.14s)]
*  And ambulances wouldn't go into these places. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1449.14s)]
*  You try to figure out who shot him, who killed him. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1453.06s)]
*  And all the evidence is all cleaned up by the time the cops get in there. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1455.82s)]
*  They're blocked from getting in. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1459.22s)]
*  Everything's picked up and cleaned up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1460.22s)]
*  Now, like, thinking back on this, right, the idea that the mayor, the police in a city [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1462.02s)]
*  would sort of step away and allow for this to happen. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1469.22s)]
*  I mean, it reminds me in a way of like what's happening on campuses across the country right now. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1473.7s)]
*  We can get there in a bit. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1479.3s)]
*  But looking back, like, how do you understand, and maybe it's impossible to know, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1480.6200000000001s)]
*  why they made the decisions they did? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1485.5s)]
*  Why did they allow this to happen? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  Why would they provide the porta potties? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1489.6200000000001s)]
*  Why would they allow for anarchy in their cities? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1492.9s)]
*  I think that there was a real belief after the rightful horror that people felt watching [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1496.02s)]
*  the video of George Floyd. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1505.38s)]
*  There was a real belief that nothing could be worse than American police. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1508.22s)]
*  And American police are so bad that we ought to try everything, anything. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1514.38s)]
*  Why not? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1522.82s)]
*  So it was a movement that said reform, the time for reform has passed. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1524.38s)]
*  The time for reform, all these reforms, body cameras didn't help. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1530.98s)]
*  You know, all these reforms didn't do it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1534.5s)]
*  I think it was true believers who thought a revolution might bring a better answer. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1536.46s)]
*  And so you had these autonomous zones embraced by the city, embraced by the elite. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1541.18s)]
*  And then you had more broadly a movement to defund and abolish the police, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1547.6200000000001s)]
*  which now is famously being walked back. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1551.86s)]
*  But at the time, to question it was considered crazy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1554.22s)]
*  I remember being in situations where I would be like, well, maybe the police could be defunded [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1558.78s)]
*  a little, but not abolished. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1568.98s)]
*  And that was considered a crazy thing to say at dinner. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1572.4199999999998s)]
*  Like that was the extent to where the rhetoric went within mainstream media [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1575.74s)]
*  and within the reporter community, which is a very tight knit lockstep community. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1582.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1586.6200000000001s)]
*  The rhetoric had gone so extreme that anything to the right of abolish was fascist. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1587.6200000000001s)]
*  I remember really distinctly you going to report this story about Chas Chopp and me [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1593.26s)]
*  being like, this is an unbelievable story. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1599.9s)]
*  Like this is the kind of thing like a Tom Wolfe or a Joe Didion would have written about. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1602.86s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1607.3s)]
*  And you had a really different reaction from some people at the New York Times about this [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1609.1s)]
*  story specifically. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1614.74s)]
*  What was it? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1615.74s)]
*  Basically, when I was heading to report that story and then when I came back and we published [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1617.1399999999999s)]
*  that story, the attacks on me became much more intense. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1623.34s)]
*  I had colleagues. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1625.5s)]
*  I mean, it sounds so petty now because they were tweeting mean things. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1627.3s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1630.6599999999999s)]
*  It was on Twitter and they were tweeting really mean things about me. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1632.1000000000001s)]
*  And it was the first time when I realized, oh, this kind of social shaming that's happening [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1635.5s)]
*  quietly in the cafeteria or over drinks or whatever, this is going to become public. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1641.3400000000001s)]
*  And this is going to become a thing I have to deal with in the public sphere. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1647.02s)]
*  And I could not that I have memorized all the mean tweets, but let's just say they [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1653.66s)]
*  think I was a fascist and anyone who reports on Chas and Chop is a monster. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1662.02s)]
*  And they were mean. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1666.98s)]
*  It was really nasty. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1669.66s)]
*  It was like middle school, but like the pettiest middle schoolers you can imagine. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1670.66s)]
*  I imagine them real nasty, but kind of good writers. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1674.5s)]
*  And they're really good at being mean. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1677.3s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1680.7s)]
*  The person who's the lead kind of soldier of censorship is a low level wire cutter writer [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1682.1s)]
*  who was in the all company Slack leading brigades against the top politics reporters. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1690.7s)]
*  And the top politics reporters would have to get in the muck and argue with her. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1698.54s)]
*  Well, that was one of the crazy things that happened. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  Newspapers like anything rely on a hierarchy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1705.18s)]
*  And what happened because of Slack and because of Twitter was there was just a total flattening of that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1711.02s)]
*  It was a very bizarre thing that the paper allowed to happen. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1716.3s)]
*  And in some ways encouraged to happen. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1720.42s)]
*  Say more about that because I think the times if someone's going to the muck. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1722.26s)]
*  It was good for your career internally. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1725.6200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1728.26s)]
*  Because the leadership of the times, the top leadership didn't love this obviously. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1729.26s)]
*  They had the old school values. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1735.02s)]
*  They wanted good journalism. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1736.42s)]
*  And it was that the broader movement was beyond controlling. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1739.54s)]
*  And within that movement you could rise up. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1744.54s)]
*  So you could rise up among your colleagues by going after a reporter who stepped out of line. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1747.46s)]
*  And you were applauded and you sort of rose in prestige among the cohort of reporters. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1753.14s)]
*  And so it was a good career move to do that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1759.66s)]
*  It was. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1763.5s)]
*  Even if the bosses didn't love it, it was good. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1764.38s)]
*  You rose in the estimation of your colleagues. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1768.02s)]
*  And I knew that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1770.58s)]
*  I knew that the people who were doing these things to me or to others. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1772.1s)]
*  We're going to win within the context of the paper. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1778.74s)]
*  And I knew that I was going to lose. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1781.6999999999998s)]
*  I also knew that the pressure you have as a reporter when you're doing controversial stories, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1784.6599999999999s)]
*  which I often do, is enormous. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1790.1s)]
*  You're going into the arena. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1793.1799999999998s)]
*  You're in battle. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1794.82s)]
*  You're doing an investigation. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1796.34s)]
*  The person might not like it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1797.8999999999999s)]
*  You're writing about something that isn't flattering. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1799.74s)]
*  You're going to get pushback. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1802.66s)]
*  And throughout my career, I've written stories where I get pushback because of my personality. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1803.94s)]
*  Because of the kind of things I write. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1810.06s)]
*  Because I make a little fun or I make a little this, right? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1811.5s)]
*  Or I report on something they didn't want me to write about or whatever. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1813.82s)]
*  Like that's the job of a reporter is you're in the arena and you're not pleasing everyone. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1816.3s)]
*  And that's OK. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1823.5s)]
*  And you've got to be tough. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1824.3s)]
*  But I could only do that from a place where my colleagues and my editors are standing behind me. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1826.6599999999999s)]
*  And you can only do that if you know that you're in an institution that will keep you protected. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1835.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that will have your back. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1844.6599999999999s)]
*  And I was increasingly aware that that wasn't the case. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1846.54s)]
*  And that actually my colleagues were the ones who were going to make my life very, very hard. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1850.5s)]
*  They were going to publicly criticize my stories. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1858.26s)]
*  They were going to engage with the nastiest trolls. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1860.78s)]
*  Then they were going to use every private thing I did within the newspaper. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1864.02s)]
*  Everything I said in every meeting would suddenly be shared with outside. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1867.5s)]
*  I started getting calls from reporters from other publications who had knowledge of things [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1871.38s)]
*  that only could be known if my colleagues were telling them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1876.9s)]
*  And I had nothing to be ashamed of. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1881.5s)]
*  I was proud of my work, proud of the things I was saying, which was pitching more stories. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1883.9s)]
*  But I was realizing, oh, wow, this world is going to tighten around me. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1887.7s)]
*  And at the same time, then, was honestly very influential for me was the Donald McNeil situation [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1895.3000000000002s)]
*  where I saw a times man who had been there his whole career. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1901.14s)]
*  He devoted himself to the newspaper and without getting into the details because it's like [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1906.42s)]
*  silly and too much and bizarre, honestly. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1911.6200000000001s)]
*  I saw his life get destroyed by this movement in a very irrational way. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1915.3000000000002s)]
*  And I saw him get his entire reputation destroyed very, very gleefully. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1922.98s)]
*  And I just saw this really kind of noble man. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1933.78s)]
*  Ruined. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1937.46s)]
*  Ruined by this movement. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1938.46s)]
*  And it upset me. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1941.1s)]
*  I was pissed off for his sake. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1942.98s)]
*  But also I was thinking, okay, so let's say I make it through this period of time. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1945.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's say I just muscle through. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1951.86s)]
*  Then what? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1956.8999999999999s)]
*  This movement, once it wants to destroy your reputation, it will succeed. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1958.82s)]
*  If you want to stay within one of these institutions and the movement of activists... [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1964.22s)]
*  If you want to stay in the old prestige world, then you have to make accommodations to it [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1971.18s)]
*  if you want to protect your reputation and your career. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1975.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1978.18s)]
*  And if you don't, it will destroy your reputation and your career. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1979.18s)]
*  And at that point, I hadn't been canceled. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1982.46s)]
*  I had all my bits and bobs. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1984.82s)]
*  I was feeling still pretty confident. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1988.1399999999999s)]
*  And I was sort of like, do I want to sit around here until they figure out how to cancel me [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1990.34s)]
*  in some real way? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1995.86s)]
*  I'm sure I'll say something. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1997.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=1999.2199999999998s)]
*  I told someone they had a nice haircut a couple weeks ago. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2001.02s)]
*  Like, was that illegal? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2003.54s)]
*  Probably. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2005.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, you start to go paranoid. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2006.1799999999998s)]
*  And so I started to realize, okay, there's really not an option for me to stay. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2007.86s)]
*  I think that this story that you're describing and the story I lived through or the story [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2013.78s)]
*  Donald McNeil threw, they're all versions of the same thing, which is you out yourself, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2018.26s)]
*  either intentionally or inadvertently, in some way, as some kind of heretic to this [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2023.7s)]
*  movement. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2029.22s)]
*  Then the target is put on your back. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2030.22s)]
*  And this is especially the case if you are of the wrong identity in some way. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2032.78s)]
*  They find a way to go after you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2037.78s)]
*  But I remember really, really clearly a moment that I was like, this is not going to go well [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2039.62s)]
*  for Nellie. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2045.02s)]
*  And it was when some sub-editor or copy editor read one of your stories and accused you of [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2046.1s)]
*  employing the white gaze. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2052.94s)]
*  And we don't need to go into that story. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2055.8599999999997s)]
*  But the reason I bring it up is because one of the things that was happening at this time [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2057.46s)]
*  that you report on in your new book is the rise of a part of this movement, let's say, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2062.46s)]
*  that describes itself as being anti-racist. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2069.1s)]
*  And one of the best chapters in the book, the one the Atlantic recently excerpted, is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2072.94s)]
*  about you going to one of these sessions with white women who feel really guilty about being [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2077.46s)]
*  white. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2084.9s)]
*  And they're presumably in this training session to learn how to be good anti-racists. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2085.9s)]
*  And I remember being astonished by what you encountered in this training session. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2092.18s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about what that period, those few days were like and how you [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2098.38s)]
*  think it sort of emblemizes this broader movement and the way that it functions? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2104.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2109.46s)]
*  So then after I left the paper, I only had my one skill set. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2110.46s)]
*  So I decided to write this book basically doing all the stories I would have wanted [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2115.5s)]
*  to do for the paper. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2119.7s)]
*  And one of those was on the rise of the modern conception of anti-racism and what that is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2122.6600000000003s)]
*  is a sort of therapeutic model of activist work. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2132.46s)]
*  And so just to back up on it, I basically become really interested in the work of this [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2138.3s)]
*  one woman, Temma Okun, who had created a list of white supremacy characteristics, white [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2145.5s)]
*  traits. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2152.86s)]
*  And the list was super popular. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2154.06s)]
*  It was accepted as completely like just a total given, just gospel at a place like The [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2157.94s)]
*  Times or a place like NPR or in any university. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2164.68s)]
*  It was so accepted that the Smithsonian Museum made a poster of it. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2168.56s)]
*  And what the list said was that there were certain white traits and these were very white [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2173.02s)]
*  and they were things such as sense of urgency, worship of the written word, individualism, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2177.22s)]
*  objectivity, punctuality. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2187.42s)]
*  Yeah, being on time. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2189.94s)]
*  And this was accepted as anti-racist. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2194.02s)]
*  I mean, even saying it out loud, writing about it, I was like, this feels racist to even [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2198.02s)]
*  write. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2203.2200000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2204.2200000000003s)]
*  But yes, this was the premier anti-racist thinking. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2205.2200000000003s)]
*  And so when I left The Times, I was sort of like, OK, let's report on this. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2208.34s)]
*  Why not? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2211.78s)]
*  Like, let's keep going. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2212.78s)]
*  And what I kind of discovered through reporting on her, the list, its creation, and its popularity, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2214.7400000000002s)]
*  most importantly, because anyone can make a list of crazy things, but why did it win? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2223.9s)]
*  And it won because for a long time, the work of anti-racist, the work of making the world [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2228.3399999999997s)]
*  less racist, making the world better for people of different races, making the world more [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2235.54s)]
*  equal, was hard work. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2239.18s)]
*  And it involved making incremental changes. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2242.42s)]
*  It involved getting a lot of people together to petition for small local changes, for laws [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2244.54s)]
*  to change really hard, requires compromise, requires all this stuff. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2250.7799999999997s)]
*  It involved trying to organize groups of white women in Berkeley to do letter writing [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2255.6s)]
*  campaigns, to get Congress interested in atrocities happening in third world countries, this kind [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  of work. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2268.44s)]
*  And the list and the new movement that rose said, you don't need to do that anymore. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2269.44s)]
*  Actually, the work of anti-racism, the work of equality and justice, is work that just [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2274.72s)]
*  has to happen inside you. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2281.4s)]
*  And it's work that you just work on yourself. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2283.48s)]
*  And it says, sit with yourself. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2286.28s)]
*  Are you white? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2288.92s)]
*  Are you a white woman in particular? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2290.2000000000003s)]
*  Sit with yourself. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2292.7400000000002s)]
*  Work on your own internalized whiteness, which is manifest as your perfectionism, your objectivity. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2294.1600000000003s)]
*  You're always feeling like you're late? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2302.76s)]
*  That's part of your internalized whiteness. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2304.56s)]
*  Release that. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2307.6s)]
*  And it turns out that a lot of people really found that appealing and that that was a lot [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2309.32s)]
*  more intuitive and interesting to people than the hard obnoxious work of doing legislation. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2315.92s)]
*  And just mind you, these folks will say explicitly, it is not a white person's job to expand, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2324.28s)]
*  let's say, the boardroom. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2335.56s)]
*  It's your job to try to dismantle the boardroom. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2337.72s)]
*  It's not your job to sort of raise things up. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2340.6s)]
*  That's implying that you know where things should go. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2343.48s)]
*  That's implying that there's a standard that should be met or something, like that a school [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2345.7599999999998s)]
*  should that a math class should be better. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2351.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2353.24s)]
*  Like, don't get involved with that. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2354.24s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2355.72s)]
*  You need to change your expectations of the world and change yourself. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2358.04s)]
*  And so I went to a Robin DiAngelo-inspired course. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  She was a speaker, but there were other, there was a lot more than just her involved with [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2366.2s)]
*  it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2369.9199999999996s)]
*  And did a chapter on being in that class and on the work of excavating your internal whiteness. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2370.9199999999996s)]
*  I want to read part of it, okay? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2380.16s)]
*  I want to read part of one of the exercises that you describe in the book. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2382.3599999999997s)]
*  The facilitators will tell you, and this is a quote, before you can abolish whiteness, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2386.52s)]
*  you need to feel your white skin. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2390.8799999999997s)]
*  You need to activate it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2393.16s)]
*  You tap on your white skin, then do a foot massage, work with each toe carefully, then [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2394.66s)]
*  slap the bottom of your feet. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2399.04s)]
*  Then you need to find your spine of dignity. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2401.1s)]
*  And then, and you write, this is not a joke, you were asked to sway like snakes. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2403.8399999999997s)]
*  You're told you should begin to rock. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2408.22s)]
*  And when you push yourself too far to the edge, just rock in place and do three communal [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2410.1s)]
*  hums to settle the nervous system. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2414.2999999999997s)]
*  So you're doing these to read that. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2418.94s)]
*  It sounds almost like it is, feel your white skin, tap on your white toe. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2421.46s)]
*  There's something so disturbing and retrograde about like, regifying whiteness in that way. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2428.7000000000003s)]
*  It's very disturbing. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2437.9s)]
*  Yeah, a big part of the movement is identifying deeply with your race, identifying deeply [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2440.62s)]
*  as white. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2450.06s)]
*  And it's a very psychologically powerful experience going into an anti-racist training course. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2451.3399999999997s)]
*  And I'll say there's a reason that it has succeeded so well. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2460.02s)]
*  And it's not just because it's more fun to do and more fun to sort of self-flagellate [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2466.8s)]
*  than it is to work on legislation, which sure, yes, it is, of course. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2470.28s)]
*  But also in that part of the anti-racist work is you have to identify as white and you have [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2474.76s)]
*  to say, my whiteness is not neutral. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2479.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not that there's a person who is black or brown and then I'm sort of this neutral [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2482.1200000000003s)]
*  non-race. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2487.84s)]
*  It's that white is also a race. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2488.84s)]
*  And I think that there is an element of truth to the idea that white people in America can [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2491.2s)]
*  live and kind of pretend like race doesn't exist. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2499.8799999999997s)]
*  But if you're not white, I don't think you have that privilege. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2502.2799999999997s)]
*  And I don't think that you can pretend race doesn't exist because it comes up, people [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2504.4399999999996s)]
*  bring it up, people see you as racial. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2507.3599999999997s)]
*  And a lot of the anti-racist movement was saying, we got to change that. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2511.24s)]
*  Everyone has a race. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2516.6s)]
*  We all have color. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2517.6s)]
*  We all have this or that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2519.1s)]
*  And so, but what that looks like in real life is having a group of white people get around [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2520.88s)]
*  and start to identify very strongly as white and try to define whiteness. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2528.2000000000003s)]
*  You talk about one woman in this course explaining that her very existence that perpetuates whiteness [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2536.6s)]
*  makes her feel shame and fear. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2544.08s)]
*  And I'm just going to read two things that she said in the course. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2545.6800000000003s)]
*  The darkest place I go is thinking it would be better if I weren't here. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2548.98s)]
*  It would be at least one less person perpetuating these things. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2554.62s)]
*  There's another woman in the group that talks about the harm and the suffering that she's [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2558.9s)]
*  causing her non-white husband because as she puts it, she is constantly perpetuating toxic [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2562.58s)]
*  whiteness at him. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2568.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2570.06s)]
*  Because what the movement says is that you have to acknowledge your whiteness and you [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2571.06s)]
*  have to try to fight it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2576.58s)]
*  But there's nothing you can do to escape it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2577.94s)]
*  And your whiteness is inherently harmful and inherently toxic to people who aren't white. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2581.56s)]
*  And so what it creates is an ideology that says actually races shouldn't mix. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2590.2200000000003s)]
*  And actually white people do more harm. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2600.34s)]
*  Even if you love your husband very much, you're harming him. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2604.1s)]
*  And you're probably harming your child. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2607.22s)]
*  And there's no path out other than just working forever to dismantle quote unquote whiteness. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2609.5s)]
*  And what I'll say is why it was so important to report on because this psychological therapeutic [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2621.8999999999996s)]
*  anti-racist movement took the smarts, the hard work, the time, the money of a bunch [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2630.96s)]
*  of people who wanted to make the world better and said this is the way to do it. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2642.44s)]
*  And my argument now after having taken the courses and sort of stepping back is I don't [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2646.48s)]
*  think this really improves people's lives a whole lot. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2653.32s)]
*  I don't think this actually makes things better for people of color. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2655.96s)]
*  This doesn't make things better for people who are in a shitty situation, let's say in [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2658.84s)]
*  a bad public school and they need the school to be better. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2663.6400000000003s)]
*  It doesn't improve things. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2668.28s)]
*  It didn't bring tangible benefits to folks. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2670.56s)]
*  And I think it was allowed to proliferate and grow in that direction because no one [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2673.6800000000003s)]
*  was covering it critically. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2679.1600000000003s)]
*  And no one was saying, wait a minute. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2681.58s)]
*  Does this really do anything to make something better for like a Hispanic guy who's wanting [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2686.48s)]
*  XYZ improvement in his life? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2691.68s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2694.0s)]
*  And I think that it applied to so many facets of the last few years and the movement that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2695.84s)]
*  I used to see as my movement, which was progressive politics. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2702.92s)]
*  And you see it with Black Lives Matter corporate, right? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2708.52s)]
*  Black Lives Matter, it's a very good name for a major fundraising operation. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2712.6s)]
*  And it was a major fundraising operation that raised money off of the names and faces literally [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2721.2s)]
*  of murdered black children. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2729.68s)]
*  What exactly did that big nonprofit do with that money? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2731.7599999999998s)]
*  To report on that, to ask that was considered white supremacy, was considered racist. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2737.54s)]
*  It was not allowed within the mainstream media. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2745.66s)]
*  And it took a few years until finally you saw some in the liberal media start to report [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2750.06s)]
*  on what did happen with those finances. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2755.54s)]
*  But it was years after all the money had been raised off of those faces and those names. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2758.1s)]
*  And you see the parents of those kids say, we're not seeing a penny of this. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2763.14s)]
*  Why are you raising this money off of my child? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2767.74s)]
*  Like Tamir Rice's mom in the book. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2769.62s)]
*  Yeah, Tamir Rice's mom. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2770.62s)]
*  I quote, I mean, this one is like haunting. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2771.62s)]
*  This kid is shot within seconds of the cops pulling up to a park. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2774.66s)]
*  He's killed. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2778.94s)]
*  And BLM uses this horrific moment to raise enormous amounts of money. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2780.66s)]
*  And not only does it not benefit the family, which you could make arguments that say, sure, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2786.9s)]
*  this isn't about giving cash to the mom or whatever, although it probably ought to be, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2791.8s)]
*  but it's about doing these real changes. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2796.48s)]
*  But what real changes happen? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2799.0s)]
*  The leaders of BLM go and buy themselves beautiful party homes. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2801.48s)]
*  They buy, basically, they just have a lot of fun with the cash. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2806.04s)]
*  And so by not covering it, by not reporting on it critically, by not, by ignoring it or [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2811.78s)]
*  just celebrating it blindly and saying anything else is racist, you allow a movement, you [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2818.22s)]
*  allow things that are actually toxic, that are actually doing the opposite of good, that [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2823.4599999999996s)]
*  are taking good intentions, that are taking money from well-intentioned people, friends [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2827.98s)]
*  of ours, people we like, nice, kind people who want to help the world be better, taking [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2832.7s)]
*  their money and basically stealing it and basically using it for whatever they want, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2838.2999999999997s)]
*  whatever silly ways. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2844.18s)]
*  It was time and again in all of the sort of branches of progressive action that I often [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2846.1800000000003s)]
*  support. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2853.54s)]
*  No one wants Tamir Rice to get shot. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2855.1400000000003s)]
*  No one wants people to wander around saying racist things. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2858.06s)]
*  It was time and again things that were, I thought I wanted the same outcome, but the [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2862.34s)]
*  process becomes this corrupt nightmare. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2866.94s)]
*  To report on it or question it is to be on the wrong side of history, to be on the side [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2871.5s)]
*  of evil. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2875.7400000000002s)]
*  And that to me is the most frustrating part of the last few years. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2877.46s)]
*  One of the areas where you have policies that many sort of good liberals are going along [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2881.06s)]
*  with thinking that these are just, these are fair, this is what social justice looks like, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2888.38s)]
*  are the policies that your hometown of San Francisco has embraced. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2894.2200000000003s)]
*  And whether it's decriminalizing drug use, open air drug sites, whether it's, well, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2899.98s)]
*  why don't you tell us the story of San Francisco over the past decade? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2907.9s)]
*  My argument is basically that San Francisco is America but five years ahead. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2911.3s)]
*  So you can see where a lot of progressive policies play out. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2915.22s)]
*  You can see what it looks like. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2920.58s)]
*  And now in my hometown you can see the backlash. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2922.78s)]
*  And the course correction and the reform that's happening. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2927.5s)]
*  But for many years the city of San Francisco run at every level by progressives. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2931.3s)]
*  I'm not even talking about, there's not like a moderate Democrat inside. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2936.7000000000003s)]
*  Everyone's a progressive. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2940.38s)]
*  Everyone's a leftist. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2941.38s)]
*  It's just sort of which, are you Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2942.38s)]
*  It became a city where the ideals and the message were all that mattered and the actual [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2946.6600000000003s)]
*  thing you were seeing. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2955.5s)]
*  I hate to use the phrase but the lived experience of being in San Francisco betrayed the rhetoric. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2956.54s)]
*  So the harm reduction and drug legalization basically, which is what happened there for [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2963.46s)]
*  years, the harm reduction policies, which were like, we're not going to try to make [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2969.38s)]
*  people get clean from drugs. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2976.02s)]
*  We're just going to make it less likely that they're going to very quickly die of the drug. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2977.5s)]
*  We're going to bring them food. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2981.74s)]
*  You walk around the city of San Francisco and there are blocks and blocks where as you're [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2984.14s)]
*  walking you're passing people who are just on the sidewalk slowly dying. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2992.02s)]
*  It's always been a reality of West Coast cities that you would see people come for the services [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=2998.02s)]
*  and to use drugs and because it tended to be more lax in the weather. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3004.5s)]
*  But over the last few years you saw that accelerate and it required coarsening yourself to live [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3008.62s)]
*  in San Francisco, LA to some extent but we don't walk as much here so you're not in it [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3017.54s)]
*  as much but in San Francisco it required living in such a way that you told yourself you were [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3022.38s)]
*  being a good progressive by walking past a person whose limbs were rotting and who was [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3028.02s)]
*  very clearly dying on the sidewalk and to walk past them was the only proper solution. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3037.22s)]
*  And what I mean is that they were getting tons of services. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3044.8199999999997s)]
*  They were getting tons of support. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3049.9399999999996s)]
*  They often had food. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3051.3799999999997s)]
*  You often have food next to them. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3052.3799999999997s)]
*  They've got a clean tent. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3054.06s)]
*  They've got all the supplies. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3055.62s)]
*  The adamant, fierce empathy behind policies that say we are not going to force anyone [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3058.58s)]
*  to get clean before we give them support on the street. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3072.58s)]
*  We are not going to force anyone to stop doing drugs. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3076.5s)]
*  We're not going to get involved here other than to help and to support as they slowly [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3078.5s)]
*  die. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3082.7799999999997s)]
*  Our job as the city and as doctors hired by the city is just to kind of support them and [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3084.1000000000004s)]
*  make it as painless a death on that sidewalk as possible. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3089.7400000000002s)]
*  That was the progressive take on what to do. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3094.5400000000004s)]
*  It just, at a certain point, my whole life I grew up in the city. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3098.1800000000003s)]
*  I was a reporter in the city. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3101.6600000000003s)]
*  I obviously saw that my whole life and at a certain point I just called bullshit and [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3103.46s)]
*  I just was like this isn't empathetic. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3109.1800000000003s)]
*  This isn't kind. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3113.14s)]
*  This is someone dying on the sidewalk, walking past them or leaving them some food or making [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3115.42s)]
*  sure they get a monthly stipend from the city is not empathy. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3121.3399999999997s)]
*  It's slowly helping them die. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3125.94s)]
*  Once I noticed that, I started seeing a lot of what else was going on in the city. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3130.3399999999997s)]
*  You just, you start to see it's not hypocrisy because they are saying what they mean and [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3139.5s)]
*  they're doing what they mean. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3146.7s)]
*  It's that actually maybe some of the policies I used to believe in were flawed and maybe [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3148.38s)]
*  some of them were not just flawed but really wrong and maybe kind of actually cruel. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3154.82s)]
*  When we met, I remember one of our early times we met, we were talking about school choice [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3160.46s)]
*  and it was an issue that I had covered a lot when I was on the editorial page, on the op-ed [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3166.5s)]
*  page of the journal and you were like oh I'm against charter schools and I was like, why? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3170.94s)]
*  It was just one of the things at the time that was like okay if you're a good progressive [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3178.9s)]
*  you need to be on the side of unions and you need to be against school choice and I think [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3184.42s)]
*  started to question that when algebra itself became something that was verboten in a place [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3189.54s)]
*  like San Francisco. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3198.2999999999997s)]
*  This was a story that I wanted to do this big San Francisco story at the time. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3199.2999999999997s)]
*  It obviously wasn't going to be possible and I first published it in the Atlantic. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3206.58s)]
*  One factor was watching people die on the street and the other factor was realizing [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3213.9s)]
*  some of the really insane policies around education that were in the city. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3219.9s)]
*  The city decided to drop accelerated eighth grade algebra and so eighth graders could [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3224.54s)]
*  no longer test into accelerated algebra which had been a real pathway for a lot of kids [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3232.06s)]
*  who were good at math to get into better high schools to then be more competitive applicants [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3238.72s)]
*  for college, whatever. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3244.52s)]
*  All the reasons why you want to like be able to take calculus senior year of high school [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3245.7999999999997s)]
*  and all that. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3249.08s)]
*  It was banned. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3251.64s)]
*  It was made illegal to teach basically and what happened then immediately is that any [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3252.64s)]
*  kid from a middle class family where the family can afford to pay for tutors they would do [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3258.14s)]
*  eighth grade algebra separately paid by their parents. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3266.44s)]
*  It just was an insane notion. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3270.24s)]
*  This idea that we should not allow accelerated courses doesn't make sense. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3272.0s)]
*  It only makes sense in a punitive way. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3276.72s)]
*  It only makes sense actually in the way of how the anti-racist movement says the goal [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3278.3199999999997s)]
*  is not to improve the situation. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3284.56s)]
*  The goal is not to expand the boardroom. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3287.48s)]
*  The goal is to dismantle the boardroom. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3289.7s)]
*  It only makes sense in the way of the argument that says excellence in math and rewarding [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3291.68s)]
*  the excellent is not the goal and actually is an evil act. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3298.72s)]
*  It actually is the word of the day. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3304.52s)]
*  It's racist. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3308.9199999999996s)]
*  All of this was happening in my hometown and I ended up doing a story not just on all these [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3309.9199999999996s)]
*  sort of wacky things that were going on or very upsetting things in the case of what [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3317.8s)]
*  was going on with overdoses in San Francisco. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3322.2400000000002s)]
*  More people overdosed on fentanyl than died of COVID in San Francisco per year. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3325.1600000000003s)]
*  What I ended up reporting on was the Reformation Movement and this was a thing that actually [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3335.44s)]
*  made me really hopeful which was basically a bunch of liberals got together in the city [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3339.8s)]
*  and said enough is enough. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3345.24s)]
*  We're opening our eyes and seeing the reality of the world and seeing the overdose deaths [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3348.9599999999996s)]
*  soar and seeing kids struggling in these public schools unable to learn accelerated math and [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3354.08s)]
*  getting screwed for culture, whatever. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3362.3199999999997s)]
*  We're opening our eyes and seeing the reality of what's happening in the city and we want [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3364.3599999999997s)]
*  to make some changes. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3369.24s)]
*  All of a sudden San Francisco had an internal liberal reformation. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3371.8s)]
*  You had for the first time in decades a recall of not just the school board. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3379.36s)]
*  The school board had gotten in particular trouble because they had been talking about [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3387.0400000000004s)]
*  how Asian parents are actually secretly all white supremacists but also a recall of the [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3392.36s)]
*  district attorney. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3397.76s)]
*  As we're in the intensity of 2020, 2021, 2022, I saw in San Francisco a movement I really [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3399.76s)]
*  identified with which was kind of the moderate liberals standing up and saying enough is [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3409.92s)]
*  enough. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3414.32s)]
*  We want to be based in reality. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3415.32s)]
*  We want to be doing things that actually help people. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3416.7200000000003s)]
*  I think people will hear this conversation and we'll be talking about CHAZ or Portland [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3419.44s)]
*  or this Robin DiAngelo training or how Algebra's racist and think, okay, all absurd, but are [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3425.2799999999997s)]
*  you just not picking here? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3433.3199999999997s)]
*  Are you just picking up on the most absurd excesses of the American left and claiming [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3435.08s)]
*  that it's something bigger than it is? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3441.04s)]
*  What would you say to the person who asked that? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3442.68s)]
*  I would say that that's willful naivete on their end. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3447.2s)]
*  I would say that to pretend like Robin DiAngelo wasn't an enormously influential figure, that [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3451.44s)]
*  the list of white supremacy characteristics wasn't enormously influential even though [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3456.6s)]
*  you had the Smithsonian Museum making a poster of it, to pretend like the policies around [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3461.12s)]
*  homelessness and drugs were some fringe silly thing when the entire American West follows [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3468.0s)]
*  To pretend like this was silly side shows is to lie. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3474.68s)]
*  And maybe you want to lie now. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3483.16s)]
*  Maybe you're embarrassed about it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3485.56s)]
*  Maybe you want to say no one ever said abolish the police. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3487.9599999999996s)]
*  This is what people say now. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3490.9199999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3491.9199999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3492.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm aware. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3493.9199999999996s)]
*  But it happened and I was there. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3497.0s)]
*  And people did argue to abolish the police. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3499.3599999999997s)]
*  People did argue that accelerated math is racist. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3501.76s)]
*  They still argue that. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3505.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, the memory holding that we're seeing or the attempt to pretend like these arguments [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3506.1600000000003s)]
*  are more rational than they are, I don't blame people. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3514.1600000000003s)]
*  I probably would too. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3519.1600000000003s)]
*  Now the last chapter of your book, I think is just so beautiful and vulnerable. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3520.96s)]
*  And it's really about your decision to break away from the old world. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3528.64s)]
*  And I want you to tell us about the kind of decision point you faced about whether or [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3533.04s)]
*  not to join in on canceling someone who was a colleague and is now a good friend of ours [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3539.44s)]
*  and why you decided not to. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3545.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3547.72s)]
*  So my real end with the movement came when I didn't cancel someone. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3549.4s)]
*  And before that, I'd canceled a person or two. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3559.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd been part of it. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3564.12s)]
*  I'd been part of whatever the call of the day was. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3565.2000000000003s)]
*  I hadn't questioned it. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3569.04s)]
*  And I'd done it quite gleefully. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3572.2400000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3574.84s)]
*  What's gleeful about it? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3575.84s)]
*  What's joyful about canceling someone? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3578.8s)]
*  In one of the chapters, I write about canceling a friend. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3581.1600000000003s)]
*  And it was a positive experience doing it because I felt immense camaraderie with my [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3587.76s)]
*  community while I was doing it. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3603.5600000000004s)]
*  I felt like I was doing justice. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3605.6s)]
*  And the person I was canceling was someone who was just very similar to me, very closely [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3609.2s)]
*  aligned politically, but had stepped out of line a little bit. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3614.6s)]
*  I just want to read this line that I think is so true and smart where you say, a cancellation [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3618.24s)]
*  isn't about finding a conservative and yelling at them. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3622.6s)]
*  It's about finding the betrayer in your midst. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3625.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3627.48s)]
*  So I had been a very good soldier of the movement. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3628.48s)]
*  There was a day that came when I couldn't join in a cancellation mob. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3631.44s)]
*  And it sounds so, I keep saying this, but so silly. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3636.72s)]
*  But when you're in it, these feel so, they feel like the most important thing in the [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3641.4s)]
*  world. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3646.2s)]
*  And basically there was a young man, a colleague of both of ours, who had been involved with [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3647.2s)]
*  an op-ed that got everyone really upset that day. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3653.88s)]
*  We were all supposed to tweet that the op-ed put our black colleagues in danger and basically [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3658.4s)]
*  call for this young man to be fired. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  And I couldn't do it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3667.6400000000003s)]
*  I have this anxiety response where my arms go limp when I'm really anxious. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3672.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it's like a psychosomatic problem. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3677.6800000000003s)]
*  And I remember sitting in the apartment and my arms were limp and I was sweating and I [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3681.28s)]
*  was just like, this is so pathetic. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3690.0800000000004s)]
*  Like I can't believe I can't do this, but I just couldn't cancel them. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3693.76s)]
*  I couldn't tweet out the tweet we were all supposed to tweet. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3697.7200000000003s)]
*  And because of that, I mean, also for a listener, this is the only point of mild bravery in [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3701.48s)]
*  the entire book. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3709.6000000000004s)]
*  It's all about me going along with everything. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3710.88s)]
*  And the only thing I do to like mildly protest is just not do a cancellation one time. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3714.12s)]
*  So this is my heroics. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3720.2000000000003s)]
*  And I just couldn't do it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3723.32s)]
*  And I didn't. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3725.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't do it. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3726.2400000000002s)]
*  And what happened? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3727.2400000000002s)]
*  And from that, several friends reached out and on that very day ended their friendships [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3728.2400000000002s)]
*  with me. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3736.4s)]
*  It was stunning. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  One very good friend. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3742.08s)]
*  And it was so shocking to me. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3744.16s)]
*  And I realized that I was done. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3752.08s)]
*  That I was, that the movement was done with me and I was done with the movement and I [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3756.3599999999997s)]
*  just couldn't force it anymore. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3760.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think part of what had happened was, I think it was two things. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3765.32s)]
*  I'm really close with a lot of my family members. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3772.32s)]
*  They all have really different politics. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3776.0s)]
*  Some of them are really conservative. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, real conservatives. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3779.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't mean like never Trumpers like your dad over here. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3780.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean like Trumpers. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3784.76s)]
*  I mean like Trump might be a little soft people. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3786.8s)]
*  We may or may not be thinking of the same uncle who we love. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3792.0800000000004s)]
*  And I love my family members. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3795.0s)]
*  And I was having a really hard time with some of the really wild rhetoric that was being [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3798.24s)]
*  said about folks like this. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3804.76s)]
*  It wasn't sitting right with me. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3808.2s)]
*  And so there was that that was happening kind of in my heart. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3811.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to, I can't say this about everyone who disagrees with me [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3815.28s)]
*  like a Nazi who deserves to be like take have their vote taken away. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3820.62s)]
*  It just isn't the case. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3825.1s)]
*  They're just, they just disagree, but we can still all have a nice Thanksgiving. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3826.1s)]
*  And so there was that. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3831.02s)]
*  And then there was also that I had really, I mean, we were together. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3833.18s)]
*  I'd fallen in love with you fully and completely. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3836.38s)]
*  And you were someone who this group was constantly trying to cancel and constantly trying to [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3840.22s)]
*  disavow and constantly disavowing. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3845.5s)]
*  And so I had seen that and I'd seen how absurd it was and how flattening this movement was [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3847.9s)]
*  and how flat it wanted to make our lives, how uncomplicated when life is complicated [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3859.62s)]
*  and politics are complicated and humans are complicated. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3865.58s)]
*  And like, I just am not going to like put these strict ridiculous boundaries on who [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3867.98s)]
*  can be in my world and who can't be. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3877.02s)]
*  So anyway, so those two factors made it so I just couldn't cancel that day. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3879.1s)]
*  I couldn't tweet the tweet. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3885.22s)]
*  I couldn't tweet the fucking tweet. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3887.06s)]
*  The one thing I needed to do and I couldn't do it. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3889.5s)]
*  And then it was done. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3891.86s)]
*  And then I was really out. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3894.14s)]
*  So that was the end of that era of my life really. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3895.74s)]
*  And it felt, I mean, in the same way that I felt the camaraderie of being part of canceling [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3901.5s)]
*  people and the camaraderie of being part of feeling on the side of justice, releasing [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3909.82s)]
*  myself from the confines of that movement also felt good. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3922.9s)]
*  I think a lot of people who have followed your work or followed your tweets or whatever [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3926.86s)]
*  will say, well, you've changed, Nellie. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3935.98s)]
*  You've changed. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3940.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, they may use a phrase like you've been red-pilled or you became right wing or [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3941.1000000000004s)]
*  you've been mugged by reality or you grew up. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3944.78s)]
*  To be young is to be a leftist. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3949.82s)]
*  To be older is to be a conservative. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3951.38s)]
*  Have you changed? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3953.5s)]
*  How do you grapple with the person that says, you know, you've changed? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3954.86s)]
*  Is it true or is it not true? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3959.06s)]
*  Of course it's true. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3961.98s)]
*  That I've grown and evolved and that I see evidence and my ideas and politics change [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3965.1400000000003s)]
*  based on evidence. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3978.26s)]
*  I used to be really adamant about drug legalization. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3980.02s)]
*  The more I saw those streets in San Francisco, the less adamant I became. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3987.54s)]
*  Then now I think drug legalization is maybe not a good idea. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3992.82s)]
*  Maybe fentanyl should be illegal, which I think technically it is in most places, but [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=3995.7s)]
*  it's not in practice. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4000.86s)]
*  I reject the movement that says unless you are for the totality and extreme sort of new [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4003.3s)]
*  random fringe philosophy here, random fringe political belief you need to have, unless [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4015.6600000000003s)]
*  you're for that, you're out. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4023.3s)]
*  You're right wing, you're red-pilled, you're this. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4026.94s)]
*  I just reject that idea of these two random extremes. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4029.66s)]
*  Just because I didn't cancel a friend that day doesn't mean all of a sudden, okay, yeah, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4037.94s)]
*  I'm also pro-life. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4043.2999999999997s)]
*  I also think life can begin in the Petri dish. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4045.46s)]
*  It's like this idea that because you're not for every plank of something, that you're [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4049.3399999999997s)]
*  completely on the out, you're right wing. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4054.5s)]
*  That is what the movement says, certainly. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4056.8599999999997s)]
*  That is what my critics say. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4059.06s)]
*  And that's their prerogative. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4066.02s)]
*  They can say that, and they'll scream it from rooftops. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4067.02s)]
*  Basically anyone who strays a tiny bit from whatever the absolute progressive orthodoxy [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4072.74s)]
*  of the day is, is labeled a right-winger. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4078.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter what your politics are, actually. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4081.58s)]
*  It just matters that little hair that you strayed, you really wronged there. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4085.34s)]
*  And by doing that little stray, all of you is suspect, and all of you is gone. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4093.58s)]
*  And the biggest insult that the community can think of is, you're right wing. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4099.38s)]
*  It's just funny because I believe in universal healthcare and I'm pro-choice and all these [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4106.860000000001s)]
*  things. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4109.82s)]
*  It's technically not true, but I'm sort of like whatever labels you want to throw at [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4111.299999999999s)]
*  people, they throw labels about everything. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4118.0199999999995s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, it makes a lot of the labels. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4120.66s)]
*  The movement ruined terms like sexist or racist or homophobic by using it to describe everything. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4125.7s)]
*  So then when we're actually confronted with a Nick Fuentes, we've run out of words. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4134.94s)]
*  We don't have the words to describe him because if everyone is racist and toddlers are racist, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4139.860000000001s)]
*  then how in the hell do you describe Nick Fuentes? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4146.64s)]
*  You're tongue tied because you used it up. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4151.08s)]
*  And so sure, yeah, the movement would describe me. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4156.68s)]
*  I'm sure at this point they'd call me homophobic. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4160.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4162.32s)]
*  But yeah, I reject it. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4164.96s)]
*  Well, one of the things that you're doing is building the free press with me. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4167.24s)]
*  And I guess I would love to maybe end there. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4171.84s)]
*  I didn't have the same, I don't know, I wasn't wearing the same rose colored glasses when [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4175.2s)]
*  I went to the New York Times. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4180.88s)]
*  I thought, can't believe I made it here. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4181.88s)]
*  Let's see how long it lasts. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4184.2s)]
*  You thought I'm going to be here forever and my new last name is I'm Nellie Bowles of the [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4185.64s)]
*  New York Times. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4189.64s)]
*  Well, now you're Nellie Bowles of the free press and we're building this new thing. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4190.64s)]
*  And we're trying, I think, in our way to uphold the values and pursue the curiosity that led [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4195.2s)]
*  us both in our way to become journalists in the first place, but to do it without the [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4202.2s)]
*  tightening that I think you so powerfully capture in Morning After the Revolution. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4208.2s)]
*  So how's it going? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4214.28s)]
*  And how does it feel to be part of a new journalistic enterprise when you were the girl that sat [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4216.16s)]
*  in front of the mirror practicing, saying I'm Nellie Bowles of the New York Times? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4222.48s)]
*  Letting go of the prestige mindset is not easy, especially for like a good American [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4226.839999999999s)]
*  girl who's always been a good student and wants to be good and wants to please because [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4235.639999999999s)]
*  the old institutions have rotted themselves out. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4239.0s)]
*  They are empty from the inside. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4243.2s)]
*  They have the names. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4248.16s)]
*  They have the gorgeous branding. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4251.32s)]
*  Gorgeous. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4253.32s)]
*  The slogans are hollow. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4254.32s)]
*  And so you have to release them. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4256.92s)]
*  You have to accept that hollowness and live your life accordingly. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4259.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think starting our own thing, it's been unbelievable. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4265.599999999999s)]
*  The title of this book is Morning After the Revolution. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4277.16s)]
*  And that implies that we're after it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4281.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people in this moment are looking at, you know, they call it this, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4283.6s)]
*  at least at Harvard, the student intifada, or they're looking, you know, all around the [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4288.36s)]
*  country at evidence that the revolution is not just after, it's just beginning. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4292.32s)]
*  How do you understand sort of where we are in the life of this thing that you wrote about [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4298.52s)]
*  here and that you continue to capture every single week in your column for the free press? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4303.44s)]
*  I think there's two answers to that. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4308.34s)]
*  But first, the revolution didn't end because it lost. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4310.62s)]
*  It ended because it won. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4317.66s)]
*  And it doesn't need to be as loud as it was. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4320.22s)]
*  It doesn't need to be huge, thousands and thousands of people in this street lighting [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4324.4400000000005s)]
*  buildings on fire anymore because the revolution that I'm writing about is now fully ingrained [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4330.2s)]
*  in our American institutions. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4337.26s)]
*  It's the DEI statement you have to write in order to get a job at any university. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4340.1s)]
*  It's fully enmeshed in our corporate life, in our, in every layer of American liberal, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4345.24s)]
*  an American elite, every museum job, every, it's one. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4356.46s)]
*  It doesn't need to be so loud. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4361.5s)]
*  Now, as to what's happening on college campuses, obviously that's a new kind of explosion of [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4364.54s)]
*  a lot of what we've seen over the last years. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4374.66s)]
*  It's another iteration of it. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4377.1s)]
*  And I think back a lot to the Antifa movement. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4378.74s)]
*  And at the time it was considered, as we've talked about, so controversial to say that [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4384.06s)]
*  Antifa was part of things because it was controversial to say that the threat of violence [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4390.74s)]
*  was part of things. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4397.0199999999995s)]
*  And the win now, the reason why the revolution is done and has won is because now in all [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4399.0599999999995s)]
*  of those protests, there's not an effort to downplay that violence is on the table. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4405.94s)]
*  And you hear it in the rhetoric. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4411.74s)]
*  You hear it in, there is only one solution, Intifada Revolution. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4413.0199999999995s)]
*  You hear it in glory to our martyrs. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4417.7s)]
*  This is the glorification of violence and these are calls for violence. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4421.58s)]
*  These are not anti-war protests. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4425.78s)]
*  These are pro-war protests, which is fine. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4427.3s)]
*  Argue for a war, argue for violence. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4430.38s)]
*  The media should at least call it what it is. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4432.7s)]
*  But I think now we're entering the kind of post-revolution moment where all of those [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4434.62s)]
*  goals that we saw have been now achieved. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4440.62s)]
*  Thanks for me. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4443.66s)]
*  Mary Weiss, my wife. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4445.0199999999995s)]
*  Millie Bull is my wife. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4446.54s)]
*  What are we having for lunch? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4447.54s)]
*  I'm starving. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4448.78s)]
*  This was a pleasure. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugmIBK2lKI&t=4449.78s)]
