Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson are the two most important liberal journalists working in the legacy press today—Ezra at The New York Times, and Derek at The Atlantic.

Although they insist they’ll never go into politics themselves, they are offering Democrats a path back to power.

To get out of the political wilderness, they say the Democrats need a new vision—one that goes beyond resistance to Trump. A vision that can bring back the disaffected Democrats who stayed home or voted red for the first time this past November.

While other progressives are doubling down on zombie ideas, afraid to confront a country that has moved decisively to the right, Ezra and Derek are willing to face reality. They see that blue states are functioning similarly to the DMV—and, as a result, losing people to states like Texas and Florida.

In their new book, Abundance, they offer a blueprint for winning them back—to cities like San Francisco and New York, but also to the Democratic Party.

The thesis is simple: To have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need.

# How Democrats Failed American Cities | Ezra Klein & Derek Thompson
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg)
*  You begin this new book of yours, Abundance, with kind of a vision, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=0.0s)]
*  a utopian vision some might say, you might say it's realistic, of 2050. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=5.0s)]
*  There's fresh, abundant water, there's incredible food, there's meat, as far as the eye can see, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=10.0s)]
*  but it's been created in petri dishes, there's no more factory farming. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=15.0s)]
*  There's AI, but the AI has not put us out of work, the AI has just made our lives better. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=20.0s)]
*  You talk about a family going on a weekend trip, a two hour jet taking them from New York to London. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=26.0s)]
*  It's an incredible vision. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=31.0s)]
*  And I was reading those pages just outside of here in a public park in New York City, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=36.0s)]
*  and I was like, wow, this is amazing fantasy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=41.0s)]
*  And I look up and it's like within, you know, a spitting distance of me, there's two homeless guys, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=46.0s)]
*  and I'm like, I'm going to live here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=51.0s)]
*  And granted, I used to live in LA, New York is a hundred times better than that, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=56.0s)]
*  and it's still a world away from this vision that you're laying out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=61.0s)]
*  So I just want to start by having you guys lay out the elevator pitch of this book. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=66.0s)]
*  What is the abundance agenda and what is the gap between our, I guess, lived experience, you could say, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=71.0s)]
*  the future vision, but is within reach if we change our policies in the right way? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=76.0s)]
*  So the abundance agenda, just very simply put, is it to have the future we want. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=81.0s)]
*  We need to build and invent more of what we need. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=86.0s)]
*  It's really it. As you say on the first page, it seems like a little too simple to write a book about this because who doesn't want more good things? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=91.0s)]
*  And then you live in California, as both of us did, and you see actually a bunch of people have stopped us from building the things we need. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=96.0s)]
*  Housing, clean energy, high speed rail, and this story can replicate itself across the country, across, frankly, the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=102.0s)]
*  So one of the things we're trying to do in the book is refocus where sort of like liberals in the American tradition, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=110.0s)]
*  Refocus liberalism on problems of supply. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=115.0s)]
*  Where do we not have enough of what we need and what has stood in the way of us creating abundance there? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=120.0s)]
*  Then there's the vignette you're talking about, which is also putting technology more at the core of questions of what kind of future we want. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=125.0s)]
*  A huge amount of creating a more wonderful future is about what technologies are inserted into it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=132.0s)]
*  I spent a lot of my career and still arguing for covering the fight to create universal health care. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=139.0s)]
*  But that insurance, whether you get it through Medicare and Medicaid or Bernie Sanders Medicare for All plan or private health insurer, that insurance is value to you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=146.0s)]
*  Is based upon the pharmaceuticals, the medical devices, the surgical techniques that are available. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=151.0s)]
*  The value of Medicare for All is different in a world with GLP-1s than in a world without them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=156.0s)]
*  The value of Medicare for All is different if we develop cures for autoimmune diseases right now that baffle doctors than if we don't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=161.0s)]
*  I think we think that the relationship, the politics around technology have become highly dysfunctional. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe more than a decade, but I'm thinking about a decade. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=173.0s)]
*  And I think that particularly on the left where there's a big disillusionment and I think the post social media era, not wrongly, I think social media has been pretty bad. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=185.0s)]
*  But in general, I would say the left is the side, let's call it that, that's much more critical of technology, much more skeptical that it can be a solution to the problem. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=193.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way that it could bring progress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=203.0s)]
*  There is something about developing, I think of felt sense, that there are just problems we cannot solve and possibilities we cannot solve. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=233.0s)]
*  We cannot create unless we pull technology forward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=263.0s)]
*  We cannot, at scale, affordably make cement in a way that does not release huge amounts of greenhouse gas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=293.0s)]
*  If we don't figure that out, there's no path forward here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=302.0s)]
*  So trying to sort of rebuild a sense that liberals need to have not just five social insurance programs they would like to expand, but five technologies they would like to pull forward and sort of orient resources to make happen, that's the other side of the project. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=308.0s)]
*  I want to go back to the jump scare moment that you had. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=318.0s)]
*  You really felt. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=323.0s)]
*  Because that jump scare that you felt. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=328.0s)]
*  The jump scare that you felt when you read the introduction to our book and then looked up into New York City, that's the jump scare that we're trying to get people to feel. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=333.0s)]
*  It's to provide a vision of, yes, utopian, but also I think actually somewhat realistic vision of what we could have in the 2050s. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=338.0s)]
*  If we developed housing abundance and energy abundance and accelerated scientific discovery, it's not crazy to think that we could have what we call star pills, which is to say GLP-1 drugs and other life-extending drugs developed in low orbit that are sent to us not by people but by people who are in the middle of the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=353.0s)]
*  We can't build them by drones that drop off the pills in our front yards. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=368.0s)]
*  These technologies I think are at the cusp of existing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=373.0s)]
*  Why in low orbit? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=378.0s)]
*  In low orbit because they have to be built in low gravity conditions. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=383.0s)]
*  But I think it's really important to say that the problem we have, and especially a problem that we have in democratically run places, because you said you came from California and then you came to New York, is that it's not just that we can't invent things that we don't have yet. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=388.0s)]
*  We also can't build what we understand. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=394.0s)]
*  The apartment building is a very ancient technology. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=399.0s)]
*  Elijah Otis came up with the elevator about 170 years ago, but somehow we can't build apartment buildings in San Francisco and Los Angeles and many democratically run cities. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=404.0s)]
*  Energy is for the most part, especially clean energy, a very ancient technology. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=409.0s)]
*  Solar energy is 70 years old. Wind turbines are 130 years old. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=414.0s)]
*  We're building it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=419.0s)]
*  And in many cases it's liberal areas that are the worst offenders when it comes to permitting and blocking and making it impossible to actually manifest a clean energy abundant world. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=424.0s)]
*  And so one thing this book really tries to do is take seriously the idea that Ezra and I, we're from the liberal tradition. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=429.0s)]
*  Maybe not all the way the Marxist tradition. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=437.0s)]
*  I'll let Ezra speak for himself. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=442.0s)]
*  I think we went from a world where liberalism was a liberalism of building between the 1930s and 1960s. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=447.0s)]
*  And then there was a turn in the 1960s and 1970s. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=452.0s)]
*  And for the last half century, liberalism has too often meant at the local and state level, a liberalism of blocking. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=457.0s)]
*  Liberalism is expressed by the fact that it's a very important part of the American culture. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=462.0s)]
*  And so we're building it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=467.0s)]
*  And so the book really tries to take seriously the idea that liberalism is a very important part of the American culture. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=472.0s)]
*  And so for the last half century, liberalism has too often meant at the local and state level, a liberalism of blocking. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=477.0s)]
*  Liberalism is expressed by, oh, you can't build that there because of environmental rules. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=482.0s)]
*  You can't build that there because it could possibly upset some local homeowners. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=487.0s)]
*  And in fact, it does seem like, according to studies, as the progressive share of a city population increases, the number of housing permits decrease. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=492.0s)]
*  So to end where I started, the jumpscare that we want people to feel, and we do want people to literally viscerally feel it, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=498.0s)]
*  is the difference between a world that absolutely is possible if we get out of our way and get back into the habit of building [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=503.0s)]
*  and the world that exists, which is a world where even in places that are run exclusively by Democrats, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=511.0s)]
*  whether it's New York or California, it is often our own side whose obsession with process is getting in the way of outcomes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=516.0s)]
*  whose obsession with process is getting in the way of outcomes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=521.0s)]
*  I'm having echoes of two other conversations that I've had on this show. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=526.0s)]
*  One with Peter Thiel, he's been on twice, but of course he was most famous. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=531.0s)]
*  I think their motto, probably call it that, was this idea that we were promised flying cars and all we got were 140 characters. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=536.0s)]
*  In other words, we were promised this sort of utopian, incredible, technologically progressive future, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=541.0s)]
*  but actually we settled for little apps that kept us glued to our phone. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=547.0s)]
*  The other is Marc Andreessen, who has written this kind of manifesto of his venture fund, talking about how it's a time to build. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=552.0s)]
*  You guys sound like you're echoing the arguments of people whose politics, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=559.0s)]
*  libertarian, center-right, you really disagree with. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=565.0s)]
*  Help square that for me. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=570.0s)]
*  The arguments that you're making now and that you make in the book feel to me in frankly a very satisfying way. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=575.0s)]
*  Like a lot of the arguments that my wife has been making to me over the dinner table for the past 10 years. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=580.0s)]
*  Yimbyism, building, getting rid of government regulation, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=585.0s)]
*  things that we don't necessarily, at least in this moment, associate with the progressive politics that both of you, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=590.0s)]
*  but especially you, Ezra, typically espouse. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=596.0s)]
*  So let me make a couple of cuts here and try to distinguish some of it, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=601.0s)]
*  at least, because there are places where I do agree with Peter Thiel. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=606.0s)]
*  I listened to that interview you did with him. I thought it was really interesting. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=611.0s)]
*  I listened to him on Joe Rogan right around that same time saying that California has become like Saudi Arabia and it's always going to sort of drift on this innovative structure it has, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=616.0s)]
*  but it can't do anything new. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=621.0s)]
*  And I think what I would probably differ with them is that people talk about deregulation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=626.0s)]
*  I think you just did a second ago. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=631.0s)]
*  And what comes to their mind immediately is deregulating the market. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=636.0s)]
*  And there are places where I think we believe that needs to happen. So home building is a very good example. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=641.0s)]
*  But one of the things we're quite focused on is deregulating government itself. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=646.0s)]
*  And I think the high speed rail or for that matter, public housing are both good examples of this, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=651.0s)]
*  where we have made it, I mean, liberals have made it from one direction. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=656.0s)]
*  So liberals have hobbled government and conservatives have tried to assault it, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=661.0s)]
*  but we're a little bit more worried about the liberal case here because we're thinking about government in blue states. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=666.0s)]
*  And so there are places where you would want government to be able to act with more agency, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=671.0s)]
*  more government to be able to act with more agency. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=676.0s)]
*  So from a public perspective, it's like, we don't need more developer built housing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=706.0s)]
*  We need more public housing. That's fine if you want to build public housing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=711.0s)]
*  But right now, under the rules that trigger when you try to use public money to build affordable housing, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=716.0s)]
*  which is another thing we focus on in the book, you end up forcing the government to build in a way that is much more [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=721.0s)]
*  cumbersome, much slower, much less affordable, and much more likely to make sure that the project [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=726.0s)]
*  is successful. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=731.0s)]
*  or Mark Andreessen is in aims and goals. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=762.0s)]
*  You know, there's versions of abundance or supply side work on the right. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=767.0s)]
*  But for instance, I don't want to unleash an orgy of fossil fuel construction. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=772.0s)]
*  I want to make clean energy easier to build. Now, maybe we both want to make affordable housing easier to build. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=777.0s)]
*  And if so, I would love to partner up. But the aims and the goals are meaningful here. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=782.0s)]
*  And I think what we're trying to do is making the government more efficient, more capable. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=787.0s)]
*  I think it is trying to light the capacity on fire. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=792.0s)]
*  Like they want to in I'm not saying for for Tealer or Andreessen here, but often I think we're caught between a right that wants to destroy government and a left that won't make government work. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=797.0s)]
*  And so for those of us who actually want to see a capable government, there's almost no home. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q2ja-QNkxg&t=802.0s)]
