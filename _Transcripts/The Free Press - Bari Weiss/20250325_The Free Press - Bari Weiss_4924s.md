Each one of us has a different conception story. For some parents, it’s a romantic night out, maybe over a candlelit dinner. For others, like Bari and Nellie, it involves a trip to a fertility clinic in a mall that doesn’t even validate parking.

And of course, for some it’s a long, challenging, emotional process involving needles, hormones, and many false starts. We know a lot of our listeners, gay and straight, can relate to that.

Now, the topic of infertility often seems like the purview of a doctor’s office or a self-help book, or maybe a women’s health column. Where you might not expect to hear about it in painstaking detail is in Andrew Schulz’s new Netflix special. Schulz’s special is vulnerable, obviously funny, and a look into the taboo topic of male infertility. It’s called Life, and if you haven’t already seen it, blow off your plans tonight and watch Life instead.

Now, the last time we had Schulz on this show was three years ago. It was in the thick of the woke culture storm, and Schulz was about to release a comedy special on Amazon. But when the streamer asked him to do what a lot of people at the time were being asked to do in comedy—censor his jokes—Schulz said no. He bet on himself and released the special independently. As he tells Bari today, he ended up making five times what he would have made with Amazon.

We’ve been talking a lot on this show about the vibe shift that’s come for politics and tech. And it’s obviously come for comedy. But actually, we think you could make the argument that comedy created the vibe shift that we’re seeing in so many other parts of the culture. And perhaps that’s because comedians with podcasts have become like the Walter Cronkites of American culture. Theo Von is almost Barbara Walters at this point. And Andrew Schulz has found himself right in the thick of it.

Last October on his podcast, Schulz sat down with then-candidate Donald Trump as he was running for president, for a candid 90-minute conversation. You can imagine the type of response he got for that.

Today on Honestly, Bari asks Schulz about that interview with Trump and whether there are certain people who are beyond the pale. They talk about his difficulty conceiving, what it meant for his masculinity, and she asks about the decision to put his—and his wife’s—vulnerability on camera. And finally, she asks how to resist audience capture.

*  13 months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4.0s)]
*  13 months? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Did you sleep train? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=5.96s)]
*  I think we said we were going to do it like... [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Dad is just too difficult. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  I think I'm too much of like an empath to do that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=11.52s)]
*  So you didn't... [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=14.08s)]
*  Are you still... [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=14.88s)]
*  Is she sleeping the night? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=15.56s)]
*  She's finally sleeping the night. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=16.44s)]
*  That happened like... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=17.64s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=18.88s)]
*  I think my wife will say one number, I'll say another. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=19.52s)]
*  But like we tried to do the sleep training thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=21.52s)]
*  It's kind of a misleading title, sleep training. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=23.56s)]
*  It's just crying it out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=25.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just ignoring your child while they cry for your attention. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=26.8s)]
*  Love and support. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=29.56s)]
*  It's brutal that we call it sleep training. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=31.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=33.4s)]
*  Because every other form of training is you whiff the thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=33.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=37.2s)]
*  Like I don't gym train and then not go to the gym. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=37.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=41.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=41.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=42.16s)]
*  So it's just... [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I don't even think it's right that we do it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=47.84s)]
*  I don't think it's right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  The French do it at like eight weeks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=49.92s)]
*  That's how you know it's wrong. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=51.84s)]
*  It's because the French do it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because their like whole culture is built on like indulgence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=54.32s)]
*  Like what makes me feel good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=57.84s)]
*  Not what makes people feel... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=59.68s)]
*  What makes me... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=61.24s)]
*  Like I want to smell good. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  I want to taste something delicious. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  I want to drink the wine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  It's me, me, me, me, me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=66.44s)]
*  So of course they develop a thing where like they can sleep and their kid is just... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Screaming their head out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=71.28s)]
*  In terror. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=72.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, now that I know that I'm never sleep training again. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=73.44s)]
*  I want to ask... [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=76.36s)]
*  I mean a lot... [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=76.92s)]

*  Ask everything. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=78.04s)]
*  Your new special life is surprising. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=78.80000000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  But this sort of like tackled the kinds of things frankly that women talk a lot about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=86.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=92.08s)]
*  Like fertility, having babies, the agony of IVF. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=92.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=96.36s)]

*  You know, all of that stuff. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  When did you realize that was going to be the material for the special? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=99.8s)]
*  Like after every like hour I try to take a little break and live life a little bit and see what is impacting me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=102.88s)]
*  So I can write some jokes about that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  Because I find if I just like tore relentlessly I just do a different version of the same jokes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=115.56s)]
*  Like life hasn't changed enough. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=116.0s)]
*  So I'm like doing new jokes but they're kind of the same. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=117.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=119.72s)]
*  Like the same topics. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=120.0s)]
*  So... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=121.6s)]
*  And then we started to try to get pregnant and it just like wasn't happening. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=122.36s)]
*  And I was just so confused. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=125.12s)]
*  Like I didn't get it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=126.88s)]
*  Like I was... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=127.84s)]
*  I felt literally like lied to. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=128.4s)]
*  Like I felt my entire life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=130.24s)]
*  Well because our whole life it's like don't get pregnant, don't get pregnant, don't get pregnant. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=131.96s)]
*  And then you try and get pregnant. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=135.44s)]
*  And then it's impossible to get pregnant. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=136.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=138.12s)]
*  And I like... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=138.4s)]
*  I felt... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=139.12s)]
*  I thought of every athlete and I'm just like... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=139.52s)]
*  Like every athlete... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=142.2s)]
*  You're like Nick Cannon has no problem getting pregnant. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=142.64s)]
*  What's wrong with me? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=145.16s)]
*  He must be having sex with so many women unprotected that he has 12. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=145.88s)]
*  Or Elon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=150.32s)]
*  Well some of those are Petri dishes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=151.32s)]
*  They have to be all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=152.68s)]

*  This Ashley Sling Claire one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=159.76s)]
*  That was old-fashioned. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=161.32s)]

*  Is that a bad thing to be after Elon's sperm? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=200.92000000000002s)]

*  I don't even know if it's... [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  But isn't the premise of... [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=254.72s)]
*  I mean, the reason I go to God from that is... [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=256.28s)]
*  A, because I think that you can live a better life if you live as if God exists. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=258.88s)]
*  There is a term for this that I'm forgetting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=263.67999999999995s)]

*  I think that's kind of... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=270.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's kind of like the idea of religion is... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=272.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=274.64s)]
*  Let's say you don't believe in God, but let's say you do these things that maybe God bestowed upon us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=274.88s)]
*  And these things make you feel better helping people, treating your neighbor with kindness. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=280.44s)]
*  Not murdering. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=285.4s)]

*  And regardless if you believe it or not, by doing it, you feel better. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=290.44s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know if I believe... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=295.48s)]
*  Like, it doesn't matter whether you believe in the positive effects of like exercise, but if you feel better after doing it, then great. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=297.56s)]

*  I don't know about salvation. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  But I do think... [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  If you're down on your luck, this person is the richest guy in the world. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=438.48s)]
*  Like, it's pretty attractive. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=442.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=443.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=444.0s)]
*  But I mean, you, Andrew Schultz. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=445.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=446.48s)]
*  I'm not sexually attracted to Elon Musk. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=447.48s)]
*  You're sure? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=448.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=449.48s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=450.48s)]
*  You ever been in a room with him? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=451.48s)]
*  I haven't been in a room with him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=452.48s)]
*  You don't know how you're going to react. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=453.92s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  That could bring out the gay in you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  Imagine that he gayed me? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  Possible. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  How fucking... [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  What a plot twist in my life. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  But I think one of the things that is kind of weird about this current moment is like... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Have you seen that movie, The Northmen? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you remember it from a few years ago? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  It's sort of like, you know, Norse, like raking and pillaging Viking pre-Christian civilization. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  And it sort of feels like some of that ethos is coming back, like post-Christian society, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=482.12s)]
*  harems are back, no one's judging Andrew Tate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=487.12s)]
*  In fact, he's sort of like this weird conservative hero, even though he is a, you know, a pimp [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=490.12s)]
*  that beats on women. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=496.12s)]
*  Why doesn't he get the Britney-Greiner treatment? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=497.12s)]
*  I mean, that's what I'm wondering. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=499.12s)]
*  Like, he's an American citizen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=501.12s)]
*  If you're an American citizen, you get to say whatever the fuck you want about America, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=503.12s)]
*  and you get to come back and we'll protect you abroad. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=506.12s)]
*  Like, I genuinely believe that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=508.12s)]
*  I genuinely believe that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=509.16s)]
*  I'm like a big rah rah rah America. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=510.16s)]
*  I love it, and it is the greatest. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=512.16s)]
*  Like, you can't... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=514.16s)]
*  But there's a difference between saying you get to say whatever you want and people celebrating [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=515.16s)]
*  you for doing so. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=520.16s)]
*  Well, I'm really talking about the reaction to him coming back. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=521.16s)]
*  It's like, if you gave Britney all that shit, yeah, she fucked up, she put the weed pen [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=523.16s)]
*  there, but she was used as like propaganda and this greater thing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=526.16s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=529.16s)]
*  She shouldn't have done it, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=530.16s)]
*  There's still personal accountability. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=531.16s)]
*  But all these people going, oh my God, we got to give back Nicolas Cage or whatever the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=532.16s)]
*  guy was. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=537.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  The Art of War? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  Nicolas Cage? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  He played the character that they gave back. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  So there was a movie made about the person that was given back to Russia. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you mean like, of course, I know what you're talking about. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  So we had to give back Nicolas Cage. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  I was like, was Nicolas Cage in a Russian prison? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  He was in a... [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he bought a Triceratops skull and then he had to give it back. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  He's the greatest American actor, by the way, Nicolas Cage. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  You think? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  I will die on this. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's him or Denzel, but yeah, I think it might be Nicolas Cage. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=566.24s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=569.24s)]
*  Not Daniel Day-Lewis? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=570.24s)]
*  He's American? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=571.24s)]
*  Well, I guess he's British, actually. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=572.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=575.24s)]
*  And also, the Daniel Day-Lewis thing, I don't... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=576.24s)]
*  I'm not like... [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=578.24s)]
*  You like Timothee Chalamet? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=579.24s)]
*  Yeah, I like him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=580.24s)]
*  I like him. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=581.24s)]
*  I thought he was great in the Bob Dylan movie. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=582.24s)]
*  I didn't watch that movie. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=584.24s)]
*  We just watched it two nights ago. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=585.24s)]
*  It's on Amazon. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=586.24s)]
*  You don't have to go to the theater. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=587.24s)]
*  Was it good? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=588.24s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=589.24s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=590.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's incredible. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=591.24s)]
*  Want to know a hot take right here? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=592.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=593.24s)]
*  Okay, my dad used to be... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=594.24s)]
*  Timothee Chalamet. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=595.28s)]
*  No, no, I don't like that twink shit. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=596.28s)]
*  I need more masculinity. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=598.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=599.28s)]
*  If I'm going to fuck a girl, I'll fuck a girl. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=600.28s)]
*  But yeah, it'd be too close. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=603.28s)]
*  If I'm going to go for it, I'm going for it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=606.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=610.28s)]
*  Elon, man. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=612.28s)]
*  Just a silver back gorilla. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=614.28s)]
*  You can't dip your toe into the gay. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=621.28s)]
*  Because you're going to get... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  The response about you doing it is never like, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  oh, I get it for him. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  You're going to get the response about going gay, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  so you might as well go full. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't think the reason people dip their toe in gay [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  is because they're thinking about the reaction. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, you don't think that everything we do [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  is for social reaction and clout? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=641.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  No, obviously not. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm also not going to have sex with Timothee Chalamet or Elon. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  But shout out to me. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  But wait, what were we just saying? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  Free will, determinism. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=653.36s)]
*  The French. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=655.36s)]
*  No, the French. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=656.36s)]
*  We're leaving the French behind. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=657.36s)]
*  I was saying to you that I think we're in a weird moment where... [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=658.36s)]
*  Oh, Andrew Tate. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=664.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=665.36s)]
*  People are emotional. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=666.36s)]
*  You can't think logically. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=668.36s)]
*  And then when somebody represents something for you [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=670.36s)]
*  that nobody else seemingly represents, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=672.36s)]
*  you kind of look past all the other shit. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=674.36s)]
*  Like Andrew Tate, male strength, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=676.36s)]
*  therefore will overlook beating women, sex trafficking. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=677.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=680.36s)]
*  100% [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=681.36s)]
*  Sex trafficking. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=682.4s)]
*  100%. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=683.4s)]
*  Has he been convicted of all these things? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=684.4s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=686.4s)]
*  Alleged. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=687.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=688.4s)]
*  A lot of these things with him are on video. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=690.4s)]
*  Got it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=692.4s)]
*  Like a tremendous number of these things. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=693.4s)]
*  My understanding is, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=694.4s)]
*  and the reason why I'm delicate with this kind of shit [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=695.4s)]
*  is because I think we should hammer people who are convicted. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=697.4s)]
*  But if you can't get convicted in Romania... [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=702.4s)]
*  This is Romania. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=708.4s)]
*  Can't they just do whatever they want? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=709.4s)]
*  But also, I don't know enough about Romanian politics. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  I think Romania might be like the sex trafficking capital world, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  so maybe to get convicted of it there, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  it's got to be egregious. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  Like a very, very high bar. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, wait a minute, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  he just has like 20 girls that he's enslaved? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  That's not that bad. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=724.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like owning like a raised pizza or something. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, you're like... [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  I was watching your special last night. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, just to take it back... [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  Back to my IVF journey with my wife. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  While other people... [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  When did masculinity become... [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  Just... [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=740.48s)]
*  Well, this is the thing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=741.48s)]
*  Watch this segue. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=742.48s)]
*  While other people are pimping or setting up harems [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=743.48s)]
*  that they're calling something else, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=749.48s)]
*  you're like positively bourgeois. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=751.48s)]
*  You're like... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=753.48s)]
*  I'm so bourgeois. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=754.48s)]
*  You are. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=755.48s)]
*  Like in a good way. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=756.48s)]
*  Back to the French. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=757.48s)]
*  You always come back to the French. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=758.48s)]
*  Why not? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=759.48s)]
*  We're going to have some brie at the end of this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=760.48s)]
*  But it's like you're married. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=761.48s)]
*  You showed this really beautiful slideshow [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=763.48s)]
*  where you're at your wedding [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=766.48s)]
*  and you're sobbing like a baby [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=767.48s)]
*  in front of your wife. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=769.52s)]
*  And the whole thing is about trying to have a family. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=770.52s)]
*  You know, last time you were on the show, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=774.52s)]
*  it was an extraordinarily different time, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=776.52s)]
*  which we'll talk about. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=778.52s)]
*  Like politically also, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=779.52s)]
*  if you didn't have a kid yet. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=780.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=783.52s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more about [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=784.52s)]
*  how you decided this was going to be the theme of it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=785.52s)]
*  Because frankly, it's not just vulnerable for you. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=788.52s)]
*  It's also vulnerable for your wife. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=791.52s)]
*  It's not like making fun of yourself. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=794.52s)]
*  Like you're talking about an intimate thing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=796.52s)]
*  and I think one of the things that comes up, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=798.56s)]
*  you know, and I don't think this is stepping on it [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=800.56s)]
*  or giving anything away. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=802.56s)]
*  Step all over it, it's fine. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=803.56s)]
*  The problem is not her, it's you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=804.56s)]
*  Yeah, 1000%. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=806.56s)]
*  She's got like perfect eggs, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=807.56s)]
*  perfect ovaries. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=808.56s)]
*  The whole thing is pristine. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=809.56s)]
*  And you find out that it's your sperm that sucks. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=810.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=814.56s)]
*  How did that affect your masculinity [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=815.56s)]
*  given that we're talking about masculinity? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=816.56s)]
*  Okay, so there's a couple good things. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=818.56s)]
*  Like obviously when you first find out, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=820.56s)]
*  listen, I assumed it was her [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=822.56s)]
*  just like every other guy does [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=824.56s)]
*  and most women do. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=825.56s)]
*  Like she was terrified it was her. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=826.56s)]
*  Like she was terrified it was her. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  Like she would say like, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  she would say things like, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=829.5999999999999s)]
*  I know it's me, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=830.5999999999999s)]
*  I used to watch Friends on my laptop [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  while I was on my stomach [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  and I fried my ovaries. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  Like she had like retrofit all these justifications, right? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  And I 1000% thought it was her. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=838.5999999999999s)]
*  The night before we got the results, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  I prayed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=842.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't think I've ever prayed for anything in my life. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=843.5999999999999s)]
*  And I prayed. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  I was like, God, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  this is 100% true. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  I said, God, if there is a problem, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=848.5999999999999s)]
*  just make it me. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=850.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't think she can handle it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  And God was like, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  say less. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  And I got those results [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=855.64s)]
*  and it was like, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=856.64s)]
*  it was bad. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=857.64s)]
*  Now I will say, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=858.64s)]
*  after getting the results [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=859.64s)]
*  and finding out it was me, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=860.64s)]
*  it made me way more comfortable [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=861.64s)]
*  sharing it on stage. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=862.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=863.64s)]
*  If it had been her, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=864.64s)]
*  it would be different. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=865.64s)]
*  I don't think I can't, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=866.64s)]
*  I could. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=867.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=868.64s)]
*  It's too vulnerable [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=869.64s)]
*  and it's her story. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=870.64s)]
*  Like not to say that this isn't also her story, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=871.64s)]
*  but it's not her like default vulnerability, 100%. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=874.64s)]
*  So now in terms of masculinity, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=879.64s)]
*  the second you find out, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=882.64s)]
*  I was like, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=883.68s)]
*  why would God not want me to have kids? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=884.68s)]
*  I really started having [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=886.68s)]
*  this almost existential crisis. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=887.68s)]
*  Crisis is a big word. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=889.68s)]
*  But I was like, why? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=890.68s)]
*  Was I not a good person? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=893.68s)]
*  Did I treat somebody poorly? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=895.68s)]
*  I was looking for this karmic solution [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=896.68s)]
*  for this position I was in. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=899.68s)]
*  And I started talking about it on stage [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=900.68s)]
*  and it was really cathartic. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=905.68s)]
*  Also you have to understand [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=907.68s)]
*  and you went through it, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=908.68s)]
*  Or your relationship with God [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=910.68s)]
*  or your, what is it, spouse? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=912.7199999999999s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  My wife. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=915.7199999999999s)]
*  Your wife, yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you're married. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  Gay marriage is legalized. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=918.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=919.7199999999999s)]
*  But did you get legally gay married [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=920.7199999999999s)]
*  or you did it before? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=921.7199999999999s)]
*  We get legally gay married. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=922.7199999999999s)]
*  The same as people get legally normal married. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but normal. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=924.7199999999999s)]
*  You said it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=925.7199999999999s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=926.7199999999999s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=927.7199999999999s)]
*  There is that internal bigotry right there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  I know my audience, Andrew. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=931.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay, it's my fault. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=933.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  But yes, we can have kids in the way that you and I. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, so you went through the whole journey. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=941.76s)]
*  Once I was able to talk about it on stage, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=950.76s)]
*  I found out how many people were going through it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=952.76s)]
*  I thought that I was literally like one in like 10 million males. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=954.76s)]
*  That's how rare I thought I was. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=957.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=959.76s)]
*  Yeah, I swear to God. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=960.76s)]
*  And I started talking about it on stage [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=961.76s)]
*  and these guys would come up to me after the show [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=963.76s)]
*  and they'd be like, they're like firemen and shit. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=965.76s)]
*  I'm not talking about some NPR fucking douchebag. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=967.76s)]
*  I'm talking about like a macho bro guy. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=970.8s)]
*  And they'd be like, hey, that was really funny stuff, man. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=974.8s)]
*  You should keep talking about that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=977.8s)]
*  And it was kind of their way of going, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=979.8s)]
*  hey, I went through it, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=982.8s)]
*  but I've never been able to tell anybody. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=983.8s)]
*  Anytime you go through fertility shit, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=985.8s)]
*  you're terrified of the judgment. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=987.8s)]
*  You don't want your friends to judge you. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=989.8s)]
*  I'm worried about my wife judging me. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=991.8s)]
*  I'm worried about if something primal in my wife [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=993.8s)]
*  is going to kick in and she just won't be attracted to me anymore [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=995.8s)]
*  because I can't do the thing we're put here to do. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=998.8399999999999s)]
*  So that first few weeks, I'm looking at her, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1001.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm waiting for her to start being disrespectful [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1004.8399999999999s)]
*  or telling me to do the laundry or something. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1007.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this is what you do. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1010.8399999999999s)]
*  It's like, Andrew, make me a sandwich. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, I will do that with my oatmeal balls or whatever. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  So it is, yeah, you go through that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1017.8399999999999s)]
*  And then I got through that [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  and I really started wanting to compete. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  I was like, I bet I could do it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1026.84s)]
*  I bet no matter what I could do it, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  I could beat the system. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  And we tried for like a month and my wife, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  and we tried for another month, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  and my wife would like cry every time she looked at a test. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's when I was like, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  all right, I'm not going to put her through this shit anymore [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1039.8799999999999s)]
*  and just fucking sack it up. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  And we did the IVF. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  And I would recommend people doing that immediately [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1043.8799999999999s)]
*  if you find out that one person has like some sort of issue [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  because it can tear a relationship apart. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  Like it's, you got to be very, very delicate with that shit. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's strange [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1055.92s)]
*  that IVF has become as politicized as it is? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1056.92s)]
*  Yeah, it is weird that there seems to be like, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1061.92s)]
*  people are like, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1064.92s)]
*  I guess the argument for the anti-abortion people is like, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1065.92s)]
*  life begins at conception, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1068.92s)]
*  And the embryos that are fertilized [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1070.92s)]
*  are essentially the beginning of life. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1073.92s)]
*  And then if you don't use them, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1075.92s)]
*  you throw them out and you're killing those babies. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1077.92s)]
*  Or you give them to science, scientific research. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1079.92s)]
*  Exactly, right, yeah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1081.92s)]
*  So they care a lot about those lives. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1083.96s)]
*  And not too much about like the lives [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1087.96s)]
*  and the foreign wars that we support. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1092.96s)]
*  Don't you also think that there's a weird paradox [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1095.96s)]
*  or maybe a total contradiction between, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1098.96s)]
*  you know, a movement that's saying, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1100.96s)]
*  we need to have more kids and the lack of kids [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1103.96s)]
*  and then trying to stop people from the tools [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1106.96s)]
*  that allow them to more easily have more children? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1110.96s)]
*  I think logically that makes sense, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1113.0s)]
*  but like, you know, we're emotional beings. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1115.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1117.0s)]
*  It's like, I get where they're coming from. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1118.0s)]
*  Like, I try to have empathy for the position [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1120.0s)]
*  even though I disagree with it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1122.0s)]
*  It's like, you do believe that that is a life [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1123.0s)]
*  and has the potential for life and that it's being stopped. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1126.0s)]
*  And the reason why they kind of stop it [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1129.0s)]
*  is that you guys know this is just not cost effective [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1131.0s)]
*  to do it every single time. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1134.0s)]
*  Oftentimes, just because you have an embryo [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1136.0s)]
*  doesn't mean it's going to like connect and turn into a baby. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1138.0s)]
*  The other thing that you have, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1140.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard a lot of jokes about Staten Island. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1142.04s)]
*  Why are you obsessed with Staten Island? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1144.04s)]
*  No, no obsession, but it's just like... [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1146.04s)]
*  It's just easy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1148.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy, but it's also like, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1149.04s)]
*  this is like a New York thing. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1151.04s)]
*  Staten Island we can make fun of. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1153.04s)]
*  If you're not from here, you can't make fun of them. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1155.04s)]
*  Because you don't know Staten Island. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1158.04s)]
*  You've never met anybody from Staten Island. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1159.04s)]
*  You've never had a friend who literally took a ferry [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1161.04s)]
*  to school every morning. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1163.04s)]
*  This is like a real thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1164.04s)]
*  So we could do it, but it's like... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1166.04s)]
*  It's the same reason I get annoyed [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1169.04s)]
*  when people remember like John Oliver, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1171.08s)]
*  Trevor Nova use Alabama as a punchline. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1173.08s)]
*  And it's just like, you're not from here, bro. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1175.08s)]
*  And you've never been there. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1177.08s)]
*  You've never been there. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1178.08s)]
*  You don't know anything about America. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1179.08s)]
*  You're just serving your base what they want. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1181.08s)]
*  But it's like, in my audience, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1183.08s)]
*  I know there's people from Staten Island there. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1184.08s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you can tell from the reaction of the crowd. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1186.08s)]
*  They love it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1188.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1189.08s)]
*  Nobody from Alabama that disagrees with John Oliver [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1190.08s)]
*  is listening to his show. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1192.08s)]
*  So it's annoying when it's a punchline. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1193.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1195.08s)]
*  Last time you were on here, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1196.08s)]
*  I went back and I saw, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1198.08s)]
*  it was 2022. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1199.12s)]
*  Zoom. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1200.12s)]
*  Yeah, Zoom, COVID, different world. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1201.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1203.12s)]
*  You had just pulled your special. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1204.12s)]
*  It was meant to go on Amazon. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1206.12s)]
*  It was meant to go on Amazon, yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1208.12s)]
*  You don't want to talk about what Streamr was at the time, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1209.12s)]
*  but it was Amazon. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1211.12s)]
*  And the reason was... [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1212.12s)]
*  You're right. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1213.12s)]
*  Of course, come on. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1214.12s)]
*  Yeah, you guys are good. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1215.12s)]
*  People think I made that up. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1216.12s)]
*  It's like, yeah, the Streamr. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1217.12s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1219.12s)]
*  It was Amazon. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1220.12s)]
*  And you basically, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1221.12s)]
*  pulled it because they wanted you to edit out some of the jokes. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1224.12s)]
*  Yeah, there was a couple of jokes [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1226.12s)]
*  that we don't feel comfortable doing, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1227.1599999999999s)]
*  which is completely reasonable, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1229.1599999999999s)]
*  given that Amazon makes no money on movies. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1231.1599999999999s)]
*  They make money on toilet paper. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you remember what the jokes were? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Michael Jackson joke [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1237.1599999999999s)]
*  and then part of the Ted Bundy joke. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1239.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the Michael Jackson joke? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1240.1599999999999s)]
*  For those who don't know your whole oeuvre, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to bring it back to French the entire hour. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  You're so cultured, dude. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1247.1599999999999s)]
*  Come on, what's the Michael Jackson joke? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  I forget the Michael Jackson joke. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1250.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1252.1599999999999s)]
*  The Bundy joke was that the girls deserved it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1254.1599999999999s)]
*  But it was not, that was the issue that they took with it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1256.2s)]
*  But the angle that I had was like, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1260.2s)]
*  he was driving like a tan Volkswagen Beetle [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1262.2s)]
*  and he managed to get like 50 girls into that car [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1264.2s)]
*  and he said like, my car is broken. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1266.2s)]
*  Like, can you help me fix it? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1268.2s)]
*  And it's just like, for a fall, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1269.2s)]
*  what girl knows how to fix a car in 1972 [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1271.2s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it was? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1274.2s)]
*  And also, why are you getting in a tan Volkswagen Beetle? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1275.2s)]
*  Like, there's so many things. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1278.2s)]
*  Like, what man walks up to a woman and goes, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1280.2s)]
*  can you fix my car? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1282.2s)]
*  Like, that guy's going to murder you, right? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1283.2s)]
*  So that was like the angle. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1285.24s)]
*  But there's still the line where I'm like, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1286.24s)]
*  they deserved it or something like that, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1288.24s)]
*  which I get. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1290.24s)]
*  And then, what was the Michael Jackson joke? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1291.24s)]
*  I mean, it was probably some victim blaming angle. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1294.24s)]
*  Like, blaming the kids. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1297.24s)]
*  Oh, that was it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1300.24s)]
*  Like, yeah, like, I believe he touched the kids, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1301.24s)]
*  but I don't think he touched enough kids [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1303.24s)]
*  for me to stop listening to his music. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1304.24s)]
*  Like, there is a number where like, you go, I can't. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1306.24s)]
*  But he didn't hit the number. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1309.24s)]
*  We still listen. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1310.24s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1311.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1312.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1313.28s)]
*  That is the thing about numbers. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1314.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1317.28s)]
*  And I got in trouble for this because it wasn't worked out. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1318.28s)]
*  It was just an idea. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1320.28s)]
*  But like, how many abortions is like too many? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1322.28s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1325.28s)]
*  Jesus, that's true. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1327.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1328.28s)]
*  That, like, that, right though? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1329.28s)]
*  Like, what's the number where the person's just like a sadist [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1331.28s)]
*  or using it as a birth, a form of birth control? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1334.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1336.28s)]
*  I mean, there was, I don't know, we're like, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1337.28s)]
*  how old are you? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1339.28s)]
*  41. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1340.28s)]
*  All right, I'm 40. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1341.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1342.32s)]
*  When I was in college, they would, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1343.32s)]
*  the pro-choice groups would show this documentary [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1345.32s)]
*  and maybe you've seen it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1347.32s)]
*  And it was called something like, I had an abortion. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1348.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1351.32s)]
*  And it was like women who had had like a dozen abortions. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1352.32s)]
*  And it was, the whole purpose of it, right, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1356.32s)]
*  was to sort of like de-stigmatize abortion. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1358.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1360.32s)]
*  But you left this feeling like, wait, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1361.32s)]
*  like, I don't know if you should have like 12. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1363.32s)]
*  Like, what does that mean? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1365.32s)]
*  There's a number. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1367.32s)]
*  Like, you can be on the pill. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1368.32s)]
*  You can get the coil. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1370.32s)]
*  Like, there seems, there is a number. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1371.36s)]
*  I don't know what the number is though. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1373.36s)]
*  And we don't want to acknowledge it [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1374.36s)]
*  because I think acknowledging that there's a number [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1375.36s)]
*  gives credence to the anti-abortion folks' argument [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1377.36s)]
*  that it is wrong, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1381.36s)]
*  So we don't want to admit that it's wrong [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1383.36s)]
*  because if it wasn't wrong at all [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1385.36s)]
*  and it's just a bunch of cells or whatever, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1386.36s)]
*  have 100. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1388.36s)]
*  But deep down, we don't believe that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1389.36s)]
*  Well, we know, I think people that are pro-choice [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1391.36s)]
*  and honest about it sort of have the Bill Clinton version [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1394.36s)]
*  of the argument still. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1398.36s)]
*  It should be safe, legal, and rare. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1399.36s)]
*  And it's not nothing. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not like, you know, getting your nails clipped [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  or something, obviously. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1407.3999999999999s)]
*  But it's a little bit like going back to the IVF. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1409.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like a little life of five-day-old cells [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  or a big life. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1415.3999999999999s)]
*  That's why I understand them [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  and I don't want to like call them stupid [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1417.3999999999999s)]
*  simply because of it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1419.3999999999999s)]
*  It's actually they're taking a hard line [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  on what they believe, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1422.3999999999999s)]
*  but they're not really wiggling on their belief system. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  So I go, okay, you're like being consistent. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  The abortion thing is tricky. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1428.44s)]
*  I actually, I understand the idea of destigmatizing it [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1429.44s)]
*  to make women feel more comfortable doing it [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1432.44s)]
*  and there must have been unbelievable like shame [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1434.44s)]
*  and scrutiny that came with it, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1436.44s)]
*  especially in the early days. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1438.44s)]
*  So I get that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1439.44s)]
*  I have tons of empathy for that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1440.44s)]
*  But I wonder if not maintaining the stigma [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1441.44s)]
*  but maintaining the concern is actually beneficial for women [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1444.44s)]
*  because they'll be like, this is a last option, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1448.44s)]
*  not an oopsie. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1451.44s)]
*  And I think when you do the whole... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1452.44s)]
*  I think it's well put. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1454.44s)]
*  There's a difference between like, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1455.44s)]
*  dismantling the taboo entirely [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1456.48s)]
*  and admitting that it is a big thing. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1458.48s)]
*  And it's going to hurt you and negatively impact you. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1460.48s)]
*  But it's not something that you should feel [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1462.48s)]
*  like profound shame around. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1465.48s)]
*  Don't feel shame. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1466.48s)]
*  And obviously we're grateful that we have it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1467.48s)]
*  I have a daughter, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1469.48s)]
*  Like, God forbid that she has to get one of those, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1470.48s)]
*  but I'd like it to be an option. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1473.48s)]
*  But I don't want her thinking it's just like, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1475.48s)]
*  oh yeah, we were in Vegas [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1478.48s)]
*  and it just didn't have a condom and then... [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1479.48s)]
*  But I knew I could go get whatever. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1481.48s)]
*  Like, I don't feel like I should be doing it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1482.48s)]
*  But I knew I could go get whatever. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1484.52s)]
*  I can't believe your daughter is 13 months old. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1486.52s)]
*  I know, I know, it's crazy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1488.52s)]
*  But you got to... [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1489.52s)]
*  Yes, this is... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1490.52s)]
*  Okay, I'm keeping you on the 20-22 for a second. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1491.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sorry. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1494.52s)]
*  I think it's kind of like... [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1495.52s)]
*  I think it's amazing how much has changed in three years. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1496.52s)]
*  At the time that you pulled it, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1498.52s)]
*  people were like... [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1500.52s)]
*  It seemed like such a gangster move. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1501.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1503.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of people were skeptical [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1504.52s)]
*  that you could kind of pull a Louis C.K. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1507.52s)]
*  and like distribute it on your own. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1509.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1511.52s)]
*  Did you end up making... [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1512.52s)]
*  So much more money. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1513.56s)]
*  So much more money. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1514.56s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1515.56s)]
*  How much? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1516.56s)]
*  Like 5X, like 10X? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1517.56s)]
*  At least 5X, maybe 7X? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1518.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1519.56s)]
*  No, 5X. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1520.56s)]
*  But I also had to... [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1521.56s)]
*  Probably 5 because I had to pay... [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1522.56s)]
*  I had to pay to get it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1525.56s)]
*  So like, I generated a lot [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1526.56s)]
*  based on what they were offering me to do it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1529.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1532.56s)]
*  But then I had to pay some of that back in to get it back. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1533.56s)]
*  It was expensive to buy it back. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1536.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1537.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1538.56s)]
*  It's like returning in advance for a book, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1539.56s)]
*  self-publishing the book, getting the money. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1540.56s)]
*  It was like perfect timing. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1542.6s)]
*  Like the story was perfect. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1543.6s)]
*  Which I understand why there's like skepticism a little bit [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1545.6s)]
*  because like the story is so perfect. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1547.6s)]
*  It feeds into like the censorship era. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1549.6s)]
*  It's also like... [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1551.6s)]
*  But it was. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1552.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1553.6s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1554.6s)]
*  It was that. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1555.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1556.6s)]
*  But it is what it is. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1557.6s)]
*  People don't want to believe it. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1558.6s)]
*  You fucking get it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1559.6s)]
*  It's like nobody wants to believe anything. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1560.6s)]
*  If there's like an alternative history for anything, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1561.6s)]
*  we just want to grab on to it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1563.6s)]
*  It makes us feel so smart to like know something [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1564.6s)]
*  that people don't know. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1567.6s)]
*  So I think there was a little bit of that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1568.6s)]
*  No, but also, Andrew, people are incentivized [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1570.6399999999999s)]
*  to have amnesia about that whole period [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  because it's so embarrassing now [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  for people to think back on the things [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  that they went along with. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1579.6399999999999s)]
*  Like sheep. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1580.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  Frankly. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  I think one of the things I've wanted to ask you [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1583.6399999999999s)]
*  is what you've learned from that experience [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1585.6399999999999s)]
*  because I feel like... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  I learned the amount of money I'm worth. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1589.6399999999999s)]
*  How much? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  Can't tell you that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  Why not? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  I'll ask Dov, your agent. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1595.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can ask him. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  Manager? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1597.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  He's my... [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1599.68s)]
*  Best friend? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1600.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1601.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1602.68s)]
*  We need to find him. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1603.68s)]
*  Listen, if there's any intelligent, beautiful, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1604.68s)]
*  sophisticated Jewish women... [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1609.68s)]
*  We're already handling this. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1611.68s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1612.68s)]
*  I'm 100% sure I know his wife. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1613.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1617.68s)]
*  Like, with absolute certainty. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1618.68s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1620.68s)]
*  This is my actual talent. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1621.68s)]
*  Okay! [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1623.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1624.68s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1625.68s)]
*  I have two already. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1626.68s)]
*  If you connect a third person, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1627.68s)]
*  you go to heaven. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1628.72s)]
*  It's going to be Dov. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1629.72s)]
*  It's done. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1630.72s)]
*  Okay, I love this. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1631.72s)]
*  It's absolutely done. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1632.72s)]
*  You don't need to pimp him out on this. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1633.72s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1634.72s)]
*  But I think for me, it was about like... [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1635.72s)]
*  All right, let's think back to five years ago. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1639.72s)]
*  The way that you... [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1642.72s)]
*  Maybe even go back a little further. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1644.72s)]
*  The only way that you could get your stuff out into the world [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1646.72s)]
*  was through these giant distribution platforms. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1650.72s)]
*  And the polarity has reversed. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1654.72s)]
*  Completely. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1656.72s)]
*  Like, now it's not them that have the power. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1657.76s)]
*  Or they do still have a tremendous amount of power. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1660.76s)]
*  But the amount of power in the hands of the creative [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1663.76s)]
*  or the talent is just absolutely enormous. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1666.76s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1669.76s)]
*  Though I do think that what is happening [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1670.76s)]
*  is now there's so many podcasts [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1672.76s)]
*  and so many networks and so many things. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1674.76s)]
*  I think people are looking for curation a little bit. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1676.76s)]
*  So I think they are going to go back to the big distributors [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1678.76s)]
*  and the people that have managed, like, create distribution. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1681.76s)]
*  And they won't necessarily favorite a Netflix [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1685.8s)]
*  over a free press, for example. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1689.8s)]
*  But they want to know that you're like a legit institution. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1691.8s)]
*  They don't care where you are. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1694.8s)]
*  I agree. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1695.8s)]
*  But they need the world curated for them a little bit. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1696.8s)]
*  Because there's too much. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1698.8s)]
*  There's too much. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1700.8s)]
*  There's like a hundred basketball podcasts [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1701.8s)]
*  all by ex-MBA players. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1704.8s)]
*  I don't know a single one of them, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1705.8s)]
*  but I'm sure that there are. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1707.8s)]
*  They're hugely popular. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1708.8s)]
*  And they're hilarious. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1709.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1710.8s)]
*  And it's this great insight into the NBA [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1711.8s)]
*  that we never got because they were so buttoned up [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1713.84s)]
*  when they would do their interviews [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1715.84s)]
*  after the games and before the games. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1717.84s)]
*  It's great, but everything is everywhere. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1719.84s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1721.84s)]
*  It's like we had the bundle, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1722.84s)]
*  then the bundle got unbundled, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1724.84s)]
*  then there's going to be bundles again. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1726.84s)]
*  And then we'll do it all over again. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1728.84s)]
*  100%. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1730.84s)]
*  Till eternity. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1731.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1732.84s)]
*  The other thing I've been thinking a lot about [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1733.84s)]
*  is Shane Gillis hosted SNL last week or the week before. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1735.84s)]
*  He was great. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1738.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1739.84s)]
*  And go back to 2019. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1740.84s)]
*  He's fired from SNL before... [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  I was at the New York Times then. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1745.8799999999999s)]
*  I remember it because I wanted to get the first interview with him. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1749.8799999999999s)]
*  He's fired before he even gets on the show. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  Now he's hosting it, like twice in a matter of a year. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1753.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, tell... [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  You've not just had a ringside seat. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  Look, he's not cliché. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1761.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there's a French version of that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  To the vibe shift in culture. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  But you've been a player in it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  I would argue had a hand in shifting it in a certain sense. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe unintentional. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1771.92s)]
*  Maybe that's not strategic, but you have. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1772.92s)]
*  Talk to us about, like, how did that change happen? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1774.92s)]
*  Like, what were the... [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1778.92s)]
*  Like, was Shane Gillis getting fired from SNL [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1780.92s)]
*  kind of like a high-water mark of the censorious age? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1783.92s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1786.92s)]
*  I think it... [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1787.92s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1788.92s)]
*  I don't know about, like, high-water mark. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1789.92s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1791.92s)]
*  Just because Shane, I don't think, was known prior to getting SNL. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1793.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1799.92s)]
*  So it's not like it's a cancellation of a very famous person. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1800.96s)]
*  It was a cancellation of a person that didn't even have a base. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1805.96s)]
*  It's kind of more impressive that he was able to build his career after that. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1810.96s)]
*  It's one thing when you're, like, famous and you get cancelled. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1814.96s)]
*  And then all these people who loved you are like, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1817.96s)]
*  that's fucked up, they can ride for you. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1819.96s)]
*  Here's this guy that nobody really... [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1821.96s)]
*  And now he has to go to... [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1823.96s)]
*  Now he's got the Scarlet Letter. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1825.96s)]
*  Like, it's a really... [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1828.0s)]
*  I think it's a really impressive case study. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1830.0s)]
*  I don't know if... [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1833.0s)]
*  Obviously he's fucking murdering, he's doing great right now. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1834.0s)]
*  But I don't know if people realized the mountain there was to climb. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1837.0s)]
*  Right, it wasn't like Louis C.K. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1841.0s)]
*  who then had the email list and could distribute on his own. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1843.0s)]
*  Yeah, like, you're not even cancelled. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1845.0s)]
*  Like, you can't, like, make, like, indie movies [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1847.0s)]
*  and get padded on the back in L.A. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1851.0s)]
*  Like, woo, you still got tens of millions of dollars [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1854.0s)]
*  and you could do whatever the fuck you want. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1857.04s)]
*  You could tour and do arenas whenever you want. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1859.04s)]
*  It's like, are you cancelled? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1861.04s)]
*  Like, you're cancelled from, like, Hollywood elitist approval. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1863.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1865.04s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1866.04s)]
*  Right, but he, like... [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1868.04s)]
*  Sandra Bullock's not going to come to my birthday. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1870.04s)]
*  Boo hoo! [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1872.04s)]
*  You know, it's like... [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1874.04s)]
*  But what Shane went through is a very different situation. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1876.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1878.04s)]
*  And you got people, like, going after this kid [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1880.04s)]
*  who doesn't really have money. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1883.04s)]
*  He doesn't really have a name. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1885.08s)]
*  And now he has this scarlet letter [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1887.08s)]
*  and he has to make a living doing stand-up in front of people. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1889.08s)]
*  Luckily, with the internet, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1892.08s)]
*  there are people really rally behind it [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1894.08s)]
*  and he built this great thing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1896.08s)]
*  But there's a way that that goes south [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1898.08s)]
*  and this kid never does stand-up again. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1900.08s)]
*  And, like, disappears from public... [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1902.08s)]
*  But how do we go from a culture where that was the norm [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1904.08s)]
*  to one where he's hosting it? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1906.08s)]
*  How do you explain the shift that's happened in the past five years? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1908.08s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, like, just media or anything, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1910.08s)]
*  like, wrestling's a perfect version of it [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1912.08s)]
*  but, like, I think that if you're successful [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1914.12s)]
*  and the people fuck with you, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1917.12s)]
*  people don't have a chance. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1919.12s)]
*  I mean, the networks don't really have a choice. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1921.12s)]
*  They have to do it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1923.12s)]
*  You know, like... [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1925.12s)]
*  So Shane, the people really fuck with [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1927.12s)]
*  and this show SNL wants to put people on [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1929.12s)]
*  who the people really fuck with. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1931.12s)]
*  So if you have the people, you win. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1933.12s)]
*  You know, like, I think there's a lot of people [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1935.12s)]
*  that operate in, like, the traditional Hollywood systems [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1937.12s)]
*  and there's, like, maybe some security there. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1939.12s)]
*  But you don't really have security [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1941.12s)]
*  because you're done. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1943.1599999999999s)]
*  But if you have the people, you always have security. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1944.1599999999999s)]
*  So that's been my whole thing. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like, how do I make sure I have the people? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  How do I have, like, a base? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  And the tricky thing with that is, like, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1952.1599999999999s)]
*  sometimes a base is available to you [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  that is an ideological base. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you're going to be authentic, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  you have to fight the urge [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1962.1599999999999s)]
*  to pander. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1964.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes. And, like, when you're being attacked, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1966.1599999999999s)]
*  it's very easy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1968.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, I have empathy for people who fall into [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1970.1599999999999s)]
*  an ideological base upon attack [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1972.2s)]
*  because, like, I just need some support. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1974.2s)]
*  And it, yeah, it's tough. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1976.2s)]
*  Like, I've been, I've gone through, like, attacks, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1978.2s)]
*  you know, for shit that people were bothered by, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1980.2s)]
*  which I get you're allowed to be bothered [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1983.2s)]
*  by whatever you want. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1985.2s)]
*  But it's just one of those things where I would go, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1987.2s)]
*  oh, man, this would be so much easier [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1989.2s)]
*  if I was just some right-wing MAGA lunatic [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1991.2s)]
*  or if I was just some lefty [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1993.2s)]
*  because the base would just go, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1995.2s)]
*  yo, we got you, these people are crazy. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1997.2s)]
*  Exactly. But then you lose your authenticity [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=1999.2s)]
*  and the whole point of creating [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2001.24s)]
*  in this decentralized space [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2003.24s)]
*  is you get to have your own fucking voice. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2005.24s)]
*  But doesn't it shock you how many people [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2007.24s)]
*  choose the box? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2009.24s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2011.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2012.24s)]
*  No, they just, yeah, you want money. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2013.24s)]
*  You don't want to create. You're not, like, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2015.24s)]
*  if you're, like, a reaction channel, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2017.24s)]
*  you just do whatever the fuck, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2019.24s)]
*  like, you just do whatever the fuck gets the views. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2021.24s)]
*  Like, you're not, like, an artist. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2023.24s)]
*  You're not, like, creating something. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2025.24s)]
*  Like, if you want to create art [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2027.24s)]
*  and you're not as pretentious as that sounds, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2029.28s)]
*  but if that's something you care about [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2031.28s)]
*  and you truly want to create it, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2033.28s)]
*  then you will do whatever allows you [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2035.28s)]
*  to create that in the most authentic way. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2037.28s)]
*  And, yeah, like, I grew up in, like, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2039.28s)]
*  a fucking dance family. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2041.28s)]
*  Like, my parents had a dance studio. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2043.28s)]
*  My dad was, like, a journal. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2045.28s)]
*  Like, he cared about interesting stories [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2047.28s)]
*  and, like, he was a truly, like, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2049.28s)]
*  authentic person. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2051.28s)]
*  My mom was as well. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2053.28s)]
*  And, like, I don't know, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2055.28s)]
*  maybe I'm lucky in that regard, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2057.32s)]
*  but at no point was I, like, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2059.32s)]
*  oh, I got to do this to get that. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2061.32s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2063.32s)]
*  And I get shit on by both sides because of it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2065.32s)]
*  And I get called a grifter by both sides [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2067.32s)]
*  because of it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2069.32s)]
*  And that is the cost of doing something [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2071.32s)]
*  truly unique. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2073.32s)]
*  And also just getting criticism [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2075.32s)]
*  is just the cost of success. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2077.32s)]
*  We have to, we can't complain about that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2079.32s)]
*  But I think it's possible to grow up in that way [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2081.32s)]
*  and to set off wanting to, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2083.32s)]
*  I don't think it sounds pretentious, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2085.36s)]
*  wanting to do something original, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2087.36s)]
*  let's say. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2089.36s)]
*  And then getting a taste of the applause [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2091.36s)]
*  or getting a taste of the money [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2093.36s)]
*  and it transforms you. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2095.36s)]
*  Or at least it seems to transform a lot of people. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2097.36s)]
*  But the question is... [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2099.36s)]
*  Like, I think, like, this question of audience capture, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2101.36s)]
*  this is what all of us are facing. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2103.36s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're an individual substacker [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2105.36s)]
*  or a podcaster or the New York Times [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2107.36s)]
*  or Netflix, you know, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2109.36s)]
*  who wants to make documentaries on celebrities in sports [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2111.36s)]
*  or whatever people want. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2113.4s)]
*  Like, there's an inherent contradiction [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2115.4s)]
*  often between what the market rewards [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2117.4s)]
*  or what your audience applauds and rewards [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2119.4s)]
*  and what your values are. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2121.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2123.4s)]
*  So what do you do in that regard? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2125.4s)]
*  I mean, I have like a lot of guardrails [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2127.4s)]
*  for myself and for the free press. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2129.4s)]
*  How do you fight? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2131.4s)]
*  Okay, how do you fight? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2133.4s)]
*  We actively publish things that we know [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2135.4s)]
*  will cause audience churn. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2137.4s)]
*  If you're looking for a rage bait, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2139.4s)]
*  there are many other outlets for you. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2141.44s)]
*  That is not what we're doing here. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2143.44s)]
*  What we're trying to do here, I mean, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2145.44s)]
*  Monday was a really good example [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2147.44s)]
*  after the whole Oval Office meltdown [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2149.44s)]
*  between Trump and Zelensky. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2151.44s)]
*  We published five or six very different perspectives [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2153.44s)]
*  on what that was [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2156.44s)]
*  and on the new Trump policy toward Russia. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2158.44s)]
*  So what's the identity? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2160.44s)]
*  How do you maintain an identity for your brand [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2162.44s)]
*  while bouncing around? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2164.44s)]
*  Because what our... [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2166.44s)]
*  The identity of our brand [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2168.44s)]
*  is truth seeking and our premise is [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2170.48s)]
*  you cannot get to truth in an echo chamber. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2172.48s)]
*  The only way that you get to truth [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2174.48s)]
*  is by sitting next to some... [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2176.48s)]
*  This is what makes it so different [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2178.48s)]
*  from any newsroom I've ever worked in. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2180.48s)]
*  Sitting next to someone who disagrees with you [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2182.48s)]
*  and you still respect, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2184.48s)]
*  admire them, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2186.48s)]
*  and collaborate with them. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2188.48s)]
*  And there's certain guardrails like [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2190.48s)]
*  no one that works here is a bigot. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2192.48s)]
*  No one that works here... [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2194.48s)]
*  There's a fundamental belief in the American project [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2196.48s)]
*  and the idea that America is good [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2198.52s)]
*  and we are lucky to live here [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2200.52s)]
*  and we want to improve it. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2202.52s)]
*  We might have different ways about how to do that. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2204.52s)]
*  And we set those guardrails really clearly. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2206.52s)]
*  But then inside of that [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2208.52s)]
*  there's a lot of room for disagreement. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2210.52s)]
*  And we think that our audience is smart enough. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2212.52s)]
*  They want to be treated like adults [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2215.52s)]
*  and they want to hear the steelman best version [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2217.52s)]
*  of different sides of an argument. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2219.52s)]
*  That's a very rare type of person. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2221.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's very rare. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2224.52s)]
*  And finding and tweezing out [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2226.56s)]
*  the kind of people that make sense here [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2228.56s)]
*  is really, really hard. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2230.56s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2234.56s)]
*  So how did you handle the Zelinsky thing? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2236.56s)]
*  What was your take on it? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2238.56s)]
*  Okay, my take in general [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2240.56s)]
*  I am someone that is more... [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2242.56s)]
*  I believe that morality [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2244.56s)]
*  and defending freedom [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2246.56s)]
*  has a place in American foreign policy. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2248.56s)]
*  And in general I've been... [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2250.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't think... [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2252.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't think... [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2254.6s)]
*  I'm saying anything [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2256.6s)]
*  that is in any way disputable to say [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2258.6s)]
*  Putin is a war criminal and a tyrant [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2260.6s)]
*  and Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2262.6s)]
*  And I'm never going to give into [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2264.6s)]
*  a revisionist version of that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2266.6s)]
*  That said, when I watched the whole [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2268.6s)]
*  50-minute clip, I guess, hour [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2270.6s)]
*  I was surprised because I went into it thinking [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2272.6s)]
*  like, Trump bad, this is going to be bad. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2276.6s)]
*  And I saw something different. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2278.6s)]
*  I saw what was meant to be [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2280.6s)]
*  sort of a photo op and a formality [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2282.64s)]
*  and frankly Trump trying to keep the lid on it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2284.64s)]
*  Zelinsky should have had an interpreter. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2286.64s)]
*  He should have worn a suit. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2288.64s)]
*  He did a lot of things wrong. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2290.64s)]
*  But also JD Vance was beating on him. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2292.64s)]
*  So that's the picture. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2294.64s)]
*  JD is... [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2296.64s)]
*  That's the picture I saw. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2298.64s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2300.64s)]
*  Yeah, what I saw was just like [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2302.64s)]
*  a failed... [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2304.64s)]
*  A failed political chess move. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2306.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2310.68s)]
*  But it was a little like [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2312.68s)]
*  the brown... [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2314.68s)]
*  By Zelinsky, not by Trump. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2316.68s)]
*  Yeah, by Zelinsky. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2318.68s)]
*  But it could be a failed chess move [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2320.68s)]
*  in those 50 minutes. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2322.68s)]
*  And that doesn't mean [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2324.68s)]
*  one needs to go to the ends of the argument, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2326.68s)]
*  which is, Zelinsky is the actual villain [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2328.68s)]
*  in this war with Russia, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2332.68s)]
*  which is where people went. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2334.68s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2336.68s)]
*  But you can't tell people how they react to things. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2338.72s)]
*  One thing I learned from stand-up in general [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2341.72s)]
*  is I can't tell you how to react to a joke. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2343.72s)]
*  My favorite thing I've ever experienced [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2347.72s)]
*  is there was this girl in an audience [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2349.72s)]
*  that I said some joke about some topic, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2351.72s)]
*  I forget what it is, and she gets up to walk out. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2353.72s)]
*  I'm like, where are you going? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2355.72s)]
*  And she's like, oh, I was just going to stay outside. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2357.72s)]
*  And I'm like, why? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2359.72s)]
*  She's like, no big deal or whatever like that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2361.72s)]
*  And I'm like, no, what's up? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2363.72s)]
*  She's like, oh, it's just the topic was a little whatever. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2365.72s)]
*  And I started to boo her on some like, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  oh, she's offended by everything shit. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, yo, shut up. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2371.7599999999998s)]
*  She's doing what we wish everybody would do. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  She felt uncomfortable. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  She's removing herself without making a scene. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2377.7599999999998s)]
*  Not like heckling? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  No, and I was like, you got to reward this. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  This is like, how selfless, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  not having that arrogance and that ego to be like, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm uncomfortable, everybody else's show will stop. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, you're like the ideal. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  So everybody has the right to be offended [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2394.7599999999998s)]
*  by whatever they want to be offended by. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2396.8s)]
*  No one should remove your right. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2398.8s)]
*  So we can't control how people react. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2400.8s)]
*  The reason why I talked about like, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2402.8s)]
*  you can't tell somebody that they're not offended. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2404.8s)]
*  Just like I get into, me and my wife get into an argument. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2408.8s)]
*  It's not even an argument. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2410.8s)]
*  If I do something that bothers her, right? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2412.8s)]
*  My knee-jerk reaction a lot of times is to explain away the bother. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2414.8s)]
*  I go, I want to be like, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2417.8s)]
*  because I'm horrified of her thinking that I am the type of person [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2419.8s)]
*  that would do something intentionally to hurt her. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2423.84s)]
*  So I'm trying to explain. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2426.84s)]
*  I'm going, no, no, that's not what I meant. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2427.84s)]
*  I didn't do that because, and that's not what she needs. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2429.84s)]
*  She doesn't think that I'm the type of person that would hurt her. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2431.84s)]
*  She loves me. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2433.84s)]
*  She knows who I am. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2434.84s)]
*  That thing hurt her feelings. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2436.84s)]
*  So all I have to go is, that's it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2438.84s)]
*  So we can't control how people react to things [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2440.84s)]
*  and how they react is real. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2444.84s)]
*  So if Zelensky does a thing, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2446.84s)]
*  which he's, it's not like he's not shrewd. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2448.84s)]
*  Like he's a guy who's in power. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2451.88s)]
*  He's managed to raise money and support around the world. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2453.88s)]
*  Like this guy did a thing in that moment [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2455.88s)]
*  that didn't work as I imagine he planned. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2458.88s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2461.88s)]
*  Okay, so we don't have to really talk about... [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2463.88s)]
*  But no one's debating that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2465.88s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2467.88s)]
*  But to me what was interesting about it was the way [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2469.88s)]
*  it was like a Rorschach test. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2471.88s)]
*  It was a little bit like... [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2473.88s)]
*  Americans are done. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2475.88s)]
*  It was a little bit like the dress, like the blue-brown dress. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2477.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2479.92s)]
*  Where what you saw depended on what your priors were. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2481.92s)]
*  But that's how our brains work, right? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2484.92s)]
*  What's that Jonathan Heitberg? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2486.92s)]
*  The Righteous Minds. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2488.92s)]
*  I love that you read that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2490.92s)]
*  It's the best book. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2492.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was an interesting one. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2494.92s)]
*  Talking to him is like... [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2496.92s)]
*  It's just, yeah, we're emotional beings [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2498.92s)]
*  and then we like retrofit justifications using logic after. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2500.92s)]
*  So what is our emotional reaction? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2502.92s)]
*  Like you said, it's a Rorschach test. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2504.92s)]
*  It's like whatever I thought about this situation before [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2506.92s)]
*  I'm just simplifying it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2508.96s)]
*  But what it was is like we can at least say, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2510.96s)]
*  hey, Zelensky, you fucked up. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2512.96s)]
*  That's not the way to get American support. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2514.96s)]
*  Of course, but I think one of the things that's so frustrating [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2516.96s)]
*  about our current moment is it's a really unenviable, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2518.96s)]
*  unrewarded position to say, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2522.96s)]
*  Zelensky fucked up and made a bad chess move. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2524.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2526.96s)]
*  And also Putin started the war. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2528.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2530.96s)]
*  And also appeasement generally, historically, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2532.96s)]
*  has proven not to be a good move. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2534.96s)]
*  And somehow holding both of those things, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2537.0s)]
*  like holding the two truths position, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2539.0s)]
*  is like the least popular thing. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2541.0s)]
*  It's certainly the least viral thing. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2543.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolutely the least viral thing. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2545.0s)]
*  I mean, the most viral thing is to be like, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2547.0s)]
*  NATO is actually the bad guy. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2549.0s)]
*  I want to give you revisionist history for it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2551.0s)]
*  We want revisionist history for everything. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2553.0s)]
*  Why do we want that right now? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2555.0s)]
*  Because it makes us feel smart without doing work. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2557.0s)]
*  We want to feel smart. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2559.0s)]
*  We want this secret knowledge. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2561.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2563.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2565.04s)]
*  It's just how do I feel smart without doing any work? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2567.04s)]
*  Do you think anti-Semitism makes people feel smart? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2569.04s)]
*  It depends in how it is positioned. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2571.04s)]
*  Like, if it's... [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2575.04s)]
*  Well, what type of anti-Semitism? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2577.04s)]
*  That there's sort of like a secret hand [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2581.04s)]
*  that controls the world, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2583.04s)]
*  and that secret hand is the Jews, is Israel. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2585.04s)]
*  I mean, it's all variations on a theme. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2588.04s)]
*  I think like... [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2590.04s)]
*  But it speaks to this... [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2592.04s)]
*  Like we're in a low-trust moment. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2594.08s)]
*  Trust in all of the institutions has been demolished. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2596.08s)]
*  And people talk about how it's a crisis of trust. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2600.08s)]
*  It's like, no, it's a crisis of trustworthiness. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2602.08s)]
*  They broke our trust. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2604.08s)]
*  And so people are searching [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2606.08s)]
*  for alternative revisionist histories. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2608.08s)]
*  Explanations for everything, yeah. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2610.08s)]
*  And I get all of that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2612.08s)]
*  Inevitably, it seems to me [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2614.08s)]
*  when people go searching for conspiracy... [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2616.08s)]
*  I don't want to say conspiracy theories. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2618.08s)]
*  For alternative revisionist histories of things, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2620.08s)]
*  it winds up going to a dark place. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2622.12s)]
*  Yeah, the Jews get thrown in there? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2624.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2626.12s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2628.12s)]
*  Did you disagree? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2630.12s)]
*  No, when we were talking about outside, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2632.12s)]
*  I think it's more tied to economic situations. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2634.12s)]
*  Resentment. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2636.12s)]
*  It's a weird thing. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2638.12s)]
*  It is kind of like with them... [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2640.12s)]
*  Okay, most people have never met a Jew. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2642.12s)]
*  I know this is crazy. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2646.12s)]
*  Jews are just so funny. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2648.12s)]
*  It's like Jews... [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2650.16s)]
*  And I was telling you this outside. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2652.16s)]
*  It's like Jews have met everybody. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2654.16s)]
*  So they think everybody's met Jews. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2656.16s)]
*  Nobody's met Jews. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2658.16s)]
*  I think there are people [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2660.16s)]
*  that don't know Seinfeld is Jewish. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2662.16s)]
*  I think there are people who have watched Seinfeld [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2664.16s)]
*  or watched Curb Your Enthusiasm. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2666.16s)]
*  They don't even know they're Jewish. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2668.16s)]
*  They're like, oh, that's just what people from New York is like. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2670.16s)]
*  Jews are so foreign to most people. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2672.16s)]
*  So foreign. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2674.16s)]
*  Where'd you grow up again? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2676.16s)]
*  I grew up in Astor Place. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2678.2s)]
*  So you're surrounded by Jews. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2680.2s)]
*  Everybody thinks I'm Jewish. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2682.2s)]
*  I get all the anti-Semitism with no heaven [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2684.2s)]
*  or control of the weather. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2686.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2688.2s)]
*  I get it all. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2690.2s)]
*  You didn't even get to meet Jeffrey Epstein after all that. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2692.2s)]
*  I get no invites. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2694.2s)]
*  I have all this empathy [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2696.2s)]
*  because I get what Jews are going through [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2698.2s)]
*  because I get all the comments. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2702.2s)]
*  If you don't like me, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2704.2s)]
*  I'm one comment away from being like, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2706.24s)]
*  you fucking Zionist something, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2708.24s)]
*  something, something, whatever. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2710.24s)]
*  Biting off the baby dick [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2712.24s)]
*  or whatever, some trope that they'll think. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2714.24s)]
*  Nice. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2716.24s)]
*  You've heard that before? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2718.24s)]
*  The moil doing it with their teeth? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2720.24s)]
*  I've heard everything. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2722.24s)]
*  Andrew, I've heard everything. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2724.24s)]
*  I'm a Jewish gay woman on the internet. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2726.24s)]
*  Okay? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2730.24s)]
*  Like, it's... [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2732.24s)]
*  You name it, babe. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, man, I have a filthy joke that I can't say. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, you can tell me later. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, good, but I do kind of want to say it. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2740.2799999999997s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  All right, we'll cut down. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2744.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, just say it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2746.2799999999997s)]
*  No, it's just like... [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2748.2799999999997s)]
*  I can't say it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2750.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2752.2799999999997s)]
*  It's you and your wife. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  Your wife is a private person. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2756.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's just a lesbian. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2758.2799999999997s)]
*  I can imagine a lesbian Jewish couple [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2760.2799999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2762.32s)]
*  That's the joke? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2764.32s)]
*  That's the joke? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2766.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2768.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2770.32s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2772.32s)]
*  So light a candle for me. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2774.32s)]
*  God bless. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2776.32s)]
*  I think the perception of Jews from non-Jews, right, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2778.32s)]
*  is success and separatism. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2782.32s)]
*  So the idea is not only they're successful, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2788.36s)]
*  but they just look after each other. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2792.36s)]
*  That's the perception. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2795.36s)]
*  Now, I don't think that perception is that wrong [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2797.36s)]
*  based on the fact that the religion doesn't proselytize. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2802.36s)]
*  That's not to say that Jews don't look out for other people. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2805.36s)]
*  Like, I grew up in fucking New York City. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2808.36s)]
*  You didn't really know who was Jewish or not [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2810.36s)]
*  until you were like bar mitzvah age. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2812.36s)]
*  Like, in the city, it wasn't that big a deal. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2814.36s)]
*  And that could have been because maybe people thought [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2816.4s)]
*  I was Jewish, but I didn't realize. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2818.4s)]
*  Outside of Israel, New York is the biggest Jewish population [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2820.4s)]
*  of any city in the world. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2822.4s)]
*  And it's like northeastern Jews kind of think they're wasps. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2824.4s)]
*  This is like another thing that we don't talk about enough. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2828.4s)]
*  But the northeastern Jews, they see wasps, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2830.4s)]
*  and they're like, ooh, I like that. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2833.4s)]
*  Ralph Lauren is like... [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2835.4s)]
*  Who doesn't like that? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2837.4s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2838.4s)]
*  Ralph Lauren is Ralph Lipschitz. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2839.4s)]
*  Exactly, but he saw Ralph Lauren, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2841.4s)]
*  and he was like, that is really nice, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2843.4s)]
*  and I'm going to do that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2845.44s)]
*  So they're like white passing as a motherfucker [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2847.44s)]
*  because they're trying to be the whitest of white people, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2850.44s)]
*  which is the wasp. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2852.44s)]
*  So you don't see that much difference. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2854.44s)]
*  Outside of the Hasidim, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2858.44s)]
*  that's like a glaring difference. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2860.44s)]
*  And they got all the technology shit for New Yorkers, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2862.44s)]
*  so we give them a pass on anything. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2865.44s)]
*  Like literally they own B&H, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2867.44s)]
*  and so they get a pass? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2869.44s)]
*  So you can build whatever tunnels you want. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2871.44s)]
*  If you need a camera, a lens, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2873.48s)]
*  a sound equipment, you cannot get it without a set of... [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2875.48s)]
*  People outside of New York are going to have no idea [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2877.48s)]
*  what we're talking about. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2878.48s)]
*  What is it? Adorama or whatever like that? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2879.48s)]
*  It's Adorama and B&H. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2881.48s)]
*  They have a monopoly on cameras, lenses or whatever. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2882.48s)]
*  And it is incredible. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2887.48s)]
*  You know the guy who owns that? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2889.48s)]
*  Only takes like a $100,000 a year salary or something like that. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2890.48s)]
*  He's like a devout... [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2893.48s)]
*  Anyway, cool stuff. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2894.48s)]
*  Some of these guys used to come to like comedy shows. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2895.48s)]
*  It was like their crazy night out, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2897.48s)]
*  and they're not really supposed to. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2898.48s)]
*  So I'd like see them at the comedy shows, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2900.48s)]
*  and they'd give me all like this... [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2902.52s)]
*  At the cellar? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2903.52s)]
*  No, there's like these tunnel ones that we would do together. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2904.52s)]
*  And... [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2906.52s)]
*  No, no, just joking. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2907.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2909.52s)]
*  Sometimes at the cellar and sometimes at the comic truck. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2910.52s)]
*  Anyway, so perception of Jews is that they're other... [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2913.52s)]
*  A lot of times like the only time a person is interacting [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2916.52s)]
*  with a Jew is if it's like their lawyer [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2919.52s)]
*  or their fucking like landlord or something like that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2921.52s)]
*  So it's also like this not exactly friendly position [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2924.52s)]
*  for a lot of people. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2927.52s)]
*  And the fact that Jews don't try to make more people be Jewish [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2929.52s)]
*  Seems weird. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2931.56s)]
*  If... [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2932.56s)]
*  Imagine you're a devout Christian [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2933.56s)]
*  and all you want is these people [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2934.56s)]
*  who aren't going to go to heaven to go with you. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2936.56s)]
*  And every Sunday they're like, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2938.56s)]
*  we've got to get more people to go to heaven. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2939.56s)]
*  And then these Jews come around [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2941.56s)]
*  and they are the richest people in your little community, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2942.56s)]
*  and they don't really hang out with that many people, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2944.56s)]
*  and they don't want you to go to heaven that bad. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2947.56s)]
*  Their heaven. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2949.56s)]
*  What is your perspective on them? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2950.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2952.56s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck do they got? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2953.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2954.56s)]
*  So this is... [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2955.56s)]
*  I'm not saying it's right. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2956.56s)]
*  I'm just saying emotionally where people go. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2957.56s)]
*  But as long as people can eat [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2958.56s)]
*  and they can pay their rent [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2959.6s)]
*  and the eggs aren't fucking $24, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2960.6s)]
*  nobody's really tripping. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2963.6s)]
*  There's this like ambient feeling towards Jews. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2964.6s)]
*  Which is what? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2968.6s)]
*  Which is what I just described. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2969.6s)]
*  A little suspicion, a little like other, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2971.6s)]
*  like a little... [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2973.6s)]
*  And I think it's not dissimilar to like, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2974.6s)]
*  and I said this outside, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2976.6s)]
*  but like how people feel about like the Rockefellers [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2977.6s)]
*  or the Vanderbilt or like any kind of legacy American name. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2980.6s)]
*  You're just like, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2985.6s)]
*  You're just like, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2986.64s)]
*  they got a lot of money [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2987.64s)]
*  and they control some shit [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2988.64s)]
*  and they're doing it just for them [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2990.64s)]
*  and I'm not in on that. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2992.64s)]
*  So I feel like it's a very similar feeling. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2994.64s)]
*  But then you have to add biblical shit to it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2996.64s)]
*  There's no biblical shit added to the Rockefellers [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=2998.64s)]
*  or the Kennedys or these people. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3000.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3002.64s)]
*  Technically they're on your team religiously. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3003.64s)]
*  Jews don't have that. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3006.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3008.64s)]
*  So that's the Senate. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3009.64s)]
*  Second you can't afford shit [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3010.64s)]
*  and the Jews still look like they're making money [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3012.64s)]
*  and they're doing okay. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3014.64s)]
*  You're like, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3015.68s)]
*  why the fuck... [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3016.68s)]
*  That ambient light gets brighter. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3017.68s)]
*  That ambient sentiment gets brighter. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3020.68s)]
*  I think if the economy is flourishing, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3022.68s)]
*  nobody's even thinking about Jewish conspiracies. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3024.68s)]
*  I don't even think they're caring about it. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3026.68s)]
*  So it's like the combination of low trust, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3028.68s)]
*  resentment, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3032.68s)]
*  what I'm calling resentment, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3033.68s)]
*  which is like why are these people successful [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3034.68s)]
*  and I'm not... [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3036.68s)]
*  Whether it's placed or not, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3037.68s)]
*  whether it's misplaced or not misplaced. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3039.68s)]
*  I don't even think they care about success [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3041.68s)]
*  I don't think they chalk it up to actual success. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3043.72s)]
*  I don't think they think that you're working hard. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3045.72s)]
*  I think that they think that because you're... [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3047.72s)]
*  It's ill-gotten gains. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3049.72s)]
*  It's Vanderbilt. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3050.72s)]
*  It's Kennedy. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3051.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3052.72s)]
*  That's amazing to me. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3053.72s)]
*  But yes. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3054.72s)]
*  I'm just saying... [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3055.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3056.72s)]
*  You're expressing it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3057.72s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3058.72s)]
*  They just don't know. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3059.72s)]
*  So it's like... [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3060.72s)]
*  But most people I think would look at American life [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3061.72s)]
*  right now and say, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3064.72s)]
*  yeah, eggs are expensive, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3065.72s)]
*  but we're not in a total financial crisis. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3067.72s)]
*  Why do you think it's taking off [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3070.72s)]
*  with astonishing speed right now? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3072.7599999999998s)]
*  No hope. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  Once people don't feel like they can have... [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3074.7599999999998s)]
*  The whole idea of America is like everybody thinks [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3076.7599999999998s)]
*  they're going to be a millionaire. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3078.7599999999998s)]
*  The poorest person here has to believe [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3080.7599999999998s)]
*  they can be a millionaire. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3082.7599999999998s)]
*  They have to believe that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3083.7599999999998s)]
*  That's how America works. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3084.7599999999998s)]
*  The second the poor start going, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3085.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm going to be poor forever, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  Luigi Mangione shoots somebody [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3089.7599999999998s)]
*  and the poor people are like, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  all right, it is what it is. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3092.7599999999998s)]
*  LA burns down and people are like... [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3094.7599999999998s)]
*  No, no, it's more than it is what it is. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3095.7599999999998s)]
*  They're happy. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3097.7599999999998s)]
*  It's glorified. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3098.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're happy. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3099.7599999999998s)]
*  The Palisades burns down and it's like, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3100.7599999999998s)]
*  the Palisades. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3101.8s)]
*  Like, you got to pay close attention to that sentiment. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3102.8s)]
*  Like, this is something I don't think... [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3105.8s)]
*  I don't want to politicize this shit, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3107.8s)]
*  but like, I don't think Democrats are paying attention to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3109.8s)]
*  and I think like Republicans... [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3111.8s)]
*  To Trump's credit, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3113.8s)]
*  he like really pays attention to like emotional trends. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3114.8s)]
*  Like, he's like, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3116.8s)]
*  what are people feeling? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3117.8s)]
*  I'm going to give them that feeling. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3118.8s)]
*  Oh, people don't trust these institutions? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3120.8s)]
*  Well, who am I hiring to head those institutions? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3122.8s)]
*  The people that criticize them the most. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3124.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3126.8s)]
*  That is a deep understanding [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3127.8s)]
*  or at least listening. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3130.84s)]
*  Now, does that mean that like those people [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3131.84s)]
*  are going to be the best people to do it? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3133.84s)]
*  Well, that we don't know yet. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3135.84s)]
*  Hopefully they are. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3138.84s)]
*  For the sake of America, hopefully they are. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3139.84s)]
*  But they are the best in the minds of the people [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3141.84s)]
*  that need that emotional thing satisfied. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3143.84s)]
*  And the Democrats are... [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3146.84s)]
*  Right now, like, unfortunately the party is... [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3149.84s)]
*  They're just huffing fumes from an old world that's dead. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3153.84s)]
*  And the young people even are like these like [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3155.84s)]
*  fourth generation trust fund nepo babies [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3158.88s)]
*  that like never had a job in their fucking life [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3161.88s)]
*  wagging their finger at you for disagreeing [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3163.88s)]
*  and like telling you... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3165.88s)]
*  If you've never had a job, you can't talk out loud. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3167.88s)]
*  You're not allowed to even talk on the internet [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3171.88s)]
*  if you've never had a job. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3173.88s)]
*  If you've never earned anything in your life, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3175.88s)]
*  you don't get to tell people who are struggling [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3177.88s)]
*  what they should think and call them stupid [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3180.88s)]
*  if they don't think it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3183.88s)]
*  You know, there's this... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3184.88s)]
*  There's a thing I said back... [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3186.92s)]
*  Now it doesn't exist anymore. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3187.92s)]
*  Now the Democrats are starting like [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3188.92s)]
*  abandoning the identity politics, but like... [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3189.92s)]
*  I mean, Gavin Newsom just had on Charlie Kirk this week [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3191.92s)]
*  and was like, I was wrong about trans and sports [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3194.92s)]
*  and you're like, okay. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3196.92s)]
*  He just wants it so bad. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3197.92s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3198.92s)]
*  But there's also a part of me that's like, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3200.92s)]
*  okay, you don't want to punish good behavior. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3201.92s)]
*  I agree. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3203.92s)]
*  Like, you're doing the right thing. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3204.92s)]
*  You want people to get back there. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3205.92s)]
*  Because I think America's better [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3207.92s)]
*  when we have like two parties [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3208.92s)]
*  that have someone really exciting. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3209.92s)]
*  Like, I'd love every presidential election [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3210.92s)]
*  to be a tough decision. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3212.92s)]
*  That'd be awesome. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3213.92s)]
*  And we're not going to get there [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3214.92s)]
*  unless we let them change [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3215.96s)]
*  or as profits let people convert. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3216.96s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3218.96s)]
*  But I think there's a way to let people change [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3219.96s)]
*  and also for people to say, I'm sorry. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3221.96s)]
*  Or people to say, I was wrong. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3223.96s)]
*  You want accountability. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3225.96s)]
*  Or I made a mistake. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3226.96s)]
*  This is the thing that like was so frustrating [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3227.96s)]
*  with like with Elon with the fucking salute. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3229.96s)]
*  Like the, I give my heart out to you shit. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3231.96s)]
*  It's like... [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3234.96s)]
*  What did you think that was? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3235.96s)]
*  I don't think it was intentional at all. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3236.96s)]
*  I don't think he was dog whistling at all. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3238.96s)]
*  Zero. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3240.96s)]
*  But I also think there's room for him to be like, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3241.96s)]
*  You could say it even funny on Twitter. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3244.0s)]
*  Be like, guys, I'm not going to lie. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3246.0s)]
*  That looked wild. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3248.0s)]
*  I was a little excited up there [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3249.0s)]
*  and it got the best of me. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3251.0s)]
*  I don't know why that came out. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3252.0s)]
*  I got to talk to my family, see what's like. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3254.0s)]
*  There's ways to be silly with it, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3256.0s)]
*  but at least acknowledge it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3257.0s)]
*  Instead of going, oh, you like censorship or whatever. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3258.0s)]
*  Now you're doing the exact same thing [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3262.0s)]
*  that the Democrats did for four years. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3264.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3266.0s)]
*  Like you can't call me weird for asking questions. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3267.0s)]
*  I would always say this like now it's kind of [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3270.0s)]
*  done because the Dems see they're moving out of it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3272.04s)]
*  I know the politics, but like you can be weird or pretentious. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3274.04s)]
*  You can't be both. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3277.04s)]
*  You can be weird or pretentious. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3278.04s)]
*  You can't be both. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3280.04s)]
*  If I ask you why the drag queen is teaching English to my kid, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3281.04s)]
*  you can't go, what are you, a bigot? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3286.04s)]
*  No, no, no, that's weird. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3288.04s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3290.04s)]
*  Don't be pretentious about your weirdness. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3291.04s)]
*  I'm just asking you an innocent question. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3294.04s)]
*  Like why? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3296.04s)]
*  Because I know there's teachers that are there to teach you [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3297.04s)]
*  So why is the drag queen doing it? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3299.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3301.08s)]
*  Is that part of the school? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3302.08s)]
*  So just that these are the things where I think they're [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3304.08s)]
*  moving away from the identity politics. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3307.08s)]
*  If they just make it about a class issue, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3309.08s)]
*  like just fucking talk about the billionaires, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3312.08s)]
*  talk about corporations, they can win easily. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3315.08s)]
*  Why won't they do it? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3318.08s)]
*  Because they're in the pockets. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3319.08s)]
*  The ones that do, do well. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3321.08s)]
*  AOC does well. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3323.08s)]
*  Bernie does well. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3325.08s)]
*  The rest of them, if they're in the pockets, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3327.12s)]
*  you can't do well. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3329.12s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3330.12s)]
*  Talk that shit. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3331.12s)]
*  And also like... [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3332.12s)]
*  But they're also giving issues away that are like 80, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3333.12s)]
*  20 issues. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3337.12s)]
*  Like which ones? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3338.12s)]
*  Trans and sports is one. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3339.12s)]
*  Crime being illegal is one. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3341.12s)]
*  Like there's such obvious things that they've like given away. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3343.12s)]
*  Like when I watched Trump sign that bill surrounded by little [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3347.12s)]
*  girls, but like Cape sports for women and you're just like, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3350.12s)]
*  how is that even possible? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3354.12s)]
*  It's just like, how is this a Republican issue? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3356.16s)]
*  Like it's actually nuts how much they've kind of like given up. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3359.16s)]
*  Because they couldn't make it a class issue, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3362.16s)]
*  so they had to latch onto something else. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3365.16s)]
*  And the only thing left was the identity politics, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3367.16s)]
*  so they're like terrified of upsetting somebody. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3369.16s)]
*  But I think it seems like they're moving away from that. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3372.16s)]
*  I think that they also need some more balls. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3375.16s)]
*  Like Americans, we're all like risk takers. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3377.16s)]
*  Like every one of us that came here, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3379.16s)]
*  our family left some situation. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3381.16s)]
*  Like someone in our family was like, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3383.16s)]
*  I'll never see you guys again. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3385.2s)]
*  I'm going to go over there. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3386.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was like fleeing like the blood, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3387.2s)]
*  like dappled step of Eastern Europe. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3389.2s)]
*  This is who we are. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3392.2s)]
*  Like in our core, we're the craziest people [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3394.2s)]
*  in our family's history. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3397.2s)]
*  Yes, it's frontiers people. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3399.2s)]
*  So literally. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3401.2s)]
*  We like one abundance. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3402.2s)]
*  You got to sell me on a lot. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3404.2s)]
*  I want a buffet. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3406.2s)]
*  I want extra sides. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3407.2s)]
*  I want the big bucket of popcorn. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3409.2s)]
*  Like sell me on a lot. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3411.2s)]
*  And then I also need digestible slogans. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3413.24s)]
*  What's the Democrats' build the wall? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3416.24s)]
*  There isn't one. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3418.24s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3419.24s)]
*  One dollar eggs. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3420.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3421.24s)]
*  Say eggs are a dollar. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3422.24s)]
*  They're not going to be a dollar, but OK, fine. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3424.24s)]
*  We're not going to get Greenland. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3426.24s)]
*  We might, actually. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3427.24s)]
*  We might. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3429.24s)]
*  Then we might have dollar eggs. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3430.24s)]
*  Fine. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3431.24s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3432.24s)]
*  Just say some shit. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3433.24s)]
*  Like say some shit that inspires me [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3434.24s)]
*  and makes me feel hopeful. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3436.24s)]
*  Get behind an idea and stick to it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3437.24s)]
*  You can also subsidize eggs like you do [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3440.24s)]
*  with corn, dairy or any of these other things. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3442.2799999999997s)]
*  Or like breast formula or something. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3444.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3446.2799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  Or why did I say breast formula? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3448.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3449.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I'm a freak. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3450.2799999999997s)]
*  Baby formula. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3451.2799999999997s)]
*  Schultz, you had on Trump in like the days [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3452.2799999999997s)]
*  just before the election. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3454.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3455.2799999999997s)]
*  The response from the Kamala Harris campaign [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3458.2799999999997s)]
*  seems to be like, holy shit. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3460.2799999999997s)]
*  You basically gave them a free donation. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3462.2799999999997s)]
*  You left that interview thinking he's going to win. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3464.2799999999997s)]
*  He's going to crush. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3467.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, immediately. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3468.2799999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3469.2799999999997s)]
*  I was walking around the streets of New York [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3470.32s)]
*  once it came out. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3471.32s)]
*  Like the day it came out, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3472.32s)]
*  I had a guy on the West Side Highway in Tribeca [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3474.32s)]
*  in New York City out loud go, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3478.32s)]
*  MAGA! [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3482.32s)]
*  When I saw that shit. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3485.32s)]
*  You were like, it's done. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3486.32s)]
*  I was like, this chick is cooked. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3487.32s)]
*  I mean, cooked. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3489.32s)]
*  The amount of like head nods. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3491.32s)]
*  I've said this before. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3493.32s)]
*  I thought it was in Fight Club. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3494.32s)]
*  Like the amount of like head nods. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3495.32s)]
*  Like people were like, yo. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3496.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3498.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3499.36s)]
*  And this is the thing. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3500.36s)]
*  Like in New York, people feel shame [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3501.36s)]
*  because New York is supposed to be this like Democrat city. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3502.36s)]
*  But all these people deep down were like, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3504.36s)]
*  yeah, we're not voting for Kamala. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3509.36s)]
*  Now here's the thing. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3510.36s)]
*  I don't even know if those people actually care about Trump. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3511.36s)]
*  The biggest illusion about this election [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3514.36s)]
*  is it wasn't like Trump populism. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3516.36s)]
*  It was a rejection of the status quo, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3518.36s)]
*  which was represented by Biden and Kamala. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3521.36s)]
*  Zombie, is it? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3523.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3524.36s)]
*  And so it's like, and the Democrats right now, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3525.36s)]
*  the funniest thing about it is like they're still trying [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3528.4s)]
*  to make the Republicans radioactive. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3531.4s)]
*  They're like, Elon is this. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3533.4s)]
*  Trump is this. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3534.4s)]
*  Yo, yo, nobody cares. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3535.4s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3536.4s)]
*  Because it's not about the people. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3537.4s)]
*  It's about the issue. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3538.4s)]
*  If the culture is changing, the people are happy. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3539.4s)]
*  So attack the culture. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3542.4s)]
*  People need hope. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3545.4s)]
*  Give them hope. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3546.4s)]
*  Does it ever blow your mind that you're in a position [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3548.4s)]
*  as a comedian that you were interviewing [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3551.4s)]
*  the president of the United States? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3554.4s)]
*  Like this whole, it's insane. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3556.4s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3557.44s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3558.44s)]
*  It's all of this is so insane. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3559.44s)]
*  So like, I think one of the things about comedians [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3561.44s)]
*  with podcasts is there's kind of like a plausible [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3564.44s)]
*  deniability, like I can talk to anybody. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3566.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3568.44s)]
*  Do you feel that way or do you feel like you have [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3569.44s)]
*  a kind of obligation or different set of responsibilities [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3571.44s)]
*  when you have on someone like that? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3574.44s)]
*  I don't feel an obligation to the listener or to the people, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3576.44s)]
*  but I do feel an obligation to myself. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3579.44s)]
*  So like when I wrestled with having Trump on, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3581.44s)]
*  there was a part of me that was like, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3585.48s)]
*  what a great accomplishment to build something [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3587.48s)]
*  that a president of the United States would come on. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3591.48s)]
*  Like I felt like really accomplished. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3594.48s)]
*  And then the second thing was like there's three issues [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3596.48s)]
*  that I really care about and I want, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3598.48s)]
*  and I have the opportunity to talk to the president [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3600.48s)]
*  of the United States about it and maybe push him [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3602.48s)]
*  in a certain direction or at least communicate [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3607.48s)]
*  how people like myself feel. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3609.48s)]
*  So that was the moral obligation. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3611.48s)]
*  It was like if I don't talk to him and he wins [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3613.52s)]
*  and he changes these things, I can't say I did everything [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3617.52s)]
*  in my power to protect these things that I care about. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3622.52s)]
*  Now there's a lot of people that will criticize [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3626.52s)]
*  having Trump on the pod, but like they'll never have [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3628.52s)]
*  to make that decision, so I don't care about your criticism. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3631.52s)]
*  Like if you don't have the opportunity, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3633.52s)]
*  I'm not worried about your opinion. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3635.52s)]
*  Like everybody wouldn't do something [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3637.52s)]
*  until they're given the opportunity. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3638.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3640.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3641.56s)]
*  Like nobody, what is the age old, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3642.56s)]
*  like nobody would suck a dick for a billion dollars. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3644.56s)]
*  It's like all right, we're going to find out. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3646.56s)]
*  We're going to find out if you would. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3648.56s)]
*  Because a billion dollars dick looks good. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3650.56s)]
*  Real good. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3653.56s)]
*  Zelinsky's the only one that won't do it. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3655.56s)]
*  So yeah, I just wanted him to say he was going [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3661.56s)]
*  to protect IVF, obviously, because of what [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3664.56s)]
*  we were going through. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3666.56s)]
*  And you know, end foreign wars. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3668.6s)]
*  Specifically foreign wars that just seem like a way [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3672.6s)]
*  to funnel money to the military, industrial, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3674.6s)]
*  I hate the term complex, but like the companies [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3677.6s)]
*  that are profiting off of it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3680.6s)]
*  And then empathy for illegals that aren't committing crimes. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3681.6s)]
*  You know, just like why don't we have a pathway [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3685.6s)]
*  to citizenship, lock up the border, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3687.6s)]
*  build the fucking wall, like do whatever you need [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3689.6s)]
*  for not another illegal to come in here. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3691.6s)]
*  But the ones that are here and are productive. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3693.6s)]
*  So when Trump and Tom Homan are talking about [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3695.64s)]
*  deporting tens of millions of people, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3697.64s)]
*  does that make you sick? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3699.64s)]
*  Sick? No. Sad. Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3700.64s)]
*  Sad. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3702.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like very sad about it, to be honest. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3703.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3706.64s)]
*  Yeah, my mom's an immigrant, you know. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3707.64s)]
*  And I grew up in New York City, you know what I mean? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3710.64s)]
*  Like I mean, I worked in restaurants for like years. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3714.64s)]
*  So like, I used to live in Spain. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3717.64s)]
*  So I speak Spanish and I would like, you know, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3719.64s)]
*  develop relationships. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3720.64s)]
*  They just tell me these guys really bust their fucking ass [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3721.64s)]
*  and like love America. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3723.68s)]
*  Like even growing up with my mom being an immigrant, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3724.68s)]
*  like immigrants love America. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3726.68s)]
*  If you think Americans love America, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3727.68s)]
*  immigrants fucking love this place. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3728.68s)]
*  So, and a lot of them, these just like amazingly productive [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3731.68s)]
*  people that would die for an opportunity to be citizenship. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3736.68s)]
*  And also they have the values. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3739.68s)]
*  Like we are like so lucky to have like Mexico as a neighbor. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3740.68s)]
*  It's like unbelievable. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3744.68s)]
*  And now we're sort of like picking a crazy fight with Mexico. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3745.68s)]
*  Yeah, like, Mexico, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3749.68s)]
*  there are countries where like their neighbor, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3751.72s)]
*  it's hostility big time. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3754.72s)]
*  You heard of Israel? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3756.72s)]
*  Yeah, heard of it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3757.72s)]
*  It's tricky, right? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3758.72s)]
*  Our neighbor believes in the same God, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3759.72s)]
*  has the same work ethic, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3762.72s)]
*  has the same like American dream. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3763.72s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, it's a dream. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3765.72s)]
*  It's a dream. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3767.72s)]
*  Like, so now I understand there are also illegal [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3768.72s)]
*  that are coming through Mexico and then, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3771.72s)]
*  and I'm all about a strong border. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3773.72s)]
*  I'm not saying we shouldn't, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3775.72s)]
*  but it's not like the people in here [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3776.72s)]
*  that aren't committing crimes are this like [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3778.72s)]
*  huge adjustment to American culture at all. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3780.7599999999998s)]
*  Like they kind of seamlessly blend into it. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3784.7599999999998s)]
*  And again, I'm talking about the people [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3787.7599999999998s)]
*  not committing crimes. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3790.7599999999998s)]
*  And there are some people listening like, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3792.7599999999998s)]
*  well, coming here illegally is a crime. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3793.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, okay, you got me. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3794.7599999999998s)]
*  But the point, the point I'm trying to make is like, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3796.7599999999998s)]
*  it's not like we have these people like on this insane [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3799.7599999999998s)]
*  like welfare state because they can't adapt [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3802.7599999999998s)]
*  to American culture. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3804.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't got to give them shit. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  They are ready to go. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3807.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, they literally show up to the store [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3809.8s)]
*  where you buy the building shit. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3812.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3814.8s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3816.8s)]
*  Completely. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3817.8s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3818.8s)]
*  How do you feel like Trump's doing so far? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3819.8s)]
*  Two months in? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3821.8s)]
*  So I don't like react to like these, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3825.8s)]
*  I don't react to anything he says about tariffs [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3827.8s)]
*  or anything like that. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3830.8s)]
*  Like unfortunately you have to litigate shit [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3831.8s)]
*  publicly as a politician, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3833.8s)]
*  which kind of like, it kind of sucks [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3834.8s)]
*  because it doesn't allow you to low ball [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3838.84s)]
*  in the way that you would want to. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3840.84s)]
*  Like when you're going to buy a car, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3841.84s)]
*  if the car's 50 grand, you're like, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3843.84s)]
*  yeah, I'll give you 40. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3844.84s)]
*  And you know you're paying 45, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3845.84s)]
*  but you got to start at 40. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3847.84s)]
*  So I feel a lot of Trump, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3848.84s)]
*  what Trump is doing is offering 40. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3850.84s)]
*  But he has to do it on the public stage [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3852.84s)]
*  and then people, even within America is like, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3855.84s)]
*  how dare you offer 40? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3857.84s)]
*  Like what the hell are you doing? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3859.84s)]
*  It's like, we don't know what the end goal is here. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3860.84s)]
*  So I think there could be some of that, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3863.84s)]
*  but I could also just be hopeful and optimistic. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3864.84s)]
*  How do you feel? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3867.88s)]
*  There are certain things I think are great. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3869.88s)]
*  I'm really happy the hostages are coming home. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3871.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3874.88s)]
*  I mean, I was so moved earlier this week [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3875.88s)]
*  when I just saw Trump in the Oval Office [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3878.88s)]
*  with a guy who has just lived through [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3880.88s)]
*  just hell on earth, like murdered his whole family, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3882.88s)]
*  kept in chains for 500 days in hell. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3885.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3888.88s)]
*  And they're, you know, and I generally like Doge. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3889.88s)]
*  I think some of it is stunty [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3894.92s)]
*  and not going for the main thing. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3896.92s)]
*  But come on, there's so much waste and fraud. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3898.92s)]
*  General direction of that, good. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3901.92s)]
*  So agree. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3903.92s)]
*  But like, you know, do we need tariffs on Canada and Mexico? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3904.92s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3908.92s)]
*  I just want to know what the goal is [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3910.92s)]
*  and he can't tell us the goal. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3911.92s)]
*  Because if he says, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3913.92s)]
*  yo, I'm just kind of fronting with the tariffs [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3914.92s)]
*  and then what they're going to do is drop this price. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3916.92s)]
*  Once they hear that, they go, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3918.92s)]
*  well, okay, I'm not dropping this price. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3919.92s)]
*  I'm not dropping this price. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3921.96s)]
*  So I got to give him a little time. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3922.96s)]
*  You got to let him cook. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3926.96s)]
*  I got to let him cook. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3927.96s)]
*  But I agree with you on Doge. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3928.96s)]
*  It's like such a bipartisan supported issue. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3930.96s)]
*  It's a no-brainer. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3932.96s)]
*  But this is where I feel like Elon's lack [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3933.96s)]
*  of like political acumen comes in, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3935.96s)]
*  where it's like you're sticking the knife in [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3936.96s)]
*  and kind of like twisting it a bit on an issue [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3938.96s)]
*  you don't have to. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3940.96s)]
*  We all want to get rid of. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3941.96s)]
*  Like everyone agrees. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3942.96s)]
*  No one wants fraud in the West. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3943.96s)]
*  But now it's become partisan. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3944.96s)]
*  Well, that's because of the, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3945.96s)]
*  that's because everything's online, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3948.96s)]
*  everything's online, everything's performative. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3950.0s)]
*  And that's the part where two months in [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3952.0s)]
*  and you and I were talking about this [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3954.0s)]
*  just before we came on, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3955.0s)]
*  like that's the thing that's freaking me out. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3956.0s)]
*  Like I'm seeing this sort of, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3959.0s)]
*  the danger of the woke left was not just their ideas. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3961.0s)]
*  It was what it was going to incubate [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3965.0s)]
*  on the illiberal right. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3967.0s)]
*  And like every, like you can't imagine [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3968.0s)]
*  that a movement that tells people [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3972.0s)]
*  that they are lesser, that they are bad, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3974.0s)]
*  that they are condemned to their immutable characteristics, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3977.04s)]
*  that that's not going to backfire in some way. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3980.04s)]
*  And I feel like we're starting to see that online [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3982.04s)]
*  and I don't know how that's going to end. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3985.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's the, that is funny. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3986.04s)]
*  It's like, what is it? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3988.04s)]
*  You know, you buy a new car, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3991.04s)]
*  you need to see how fast it goes, right? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3993.04s)]
*  Like if you got a sports car, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3995.04s)]
*  like you don't buy a Ferrari [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3997.04s)]
*  without pushing that pedal all the way down. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=3998.04s)]
*  So we're in this age of censorship [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4000.04s)]
*  where people feel like there's a governor on their Ferrari. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4002.04s)]
*  And then we come out and they're like, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4005.08s)]
*  I got to let this shit rip. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4008.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4009.08s)]
*  And it's like, it's not just like, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4010.08s)]
*  gay and retard are backfired. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4012.08s)]
*  No, it's like, Hitler's misunderstood. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4013.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4015.08s)]
*  You're like, what? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4016.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4017.08s)]
*  Yeah, so that's the revisionist history shit [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4018.08s)]
*  where what I assume happens. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4021.08s)]
*  It's like Churchill was the real villain. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4024.08s)]
*  You're like, no. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4026.08s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4027.08s)]
*  You got to be kidding. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4028.08s)]
*  This is what I think is, happens with the Ferrari, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4029.08s)]
*  is eventually you realize it's not fun [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4033.12s)]
*  to drive your Ferrari 260 miles per hour. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4036.12s)]
*  But you get it out of your system. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4039.12s)]
*  But at what cost? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4042.12s)]
*  You could be driving the Ferrari [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4043.12s)]
*  at 260 miles an hour mowing people down. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4045.12s)]
*  Yeah, and some people get mowed down [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4048.12s)]
*  and then some people crash into a pole. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4049.12s)]
*  And that is the cost of, unfortunately, free speech. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4051.12s)]
*  But I think what does happen is [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4054.12s)]
*  the pendulum eventually swings back. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4056.12s)]
*  So it's swung this way. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4058.12s)]
*  Now the rejection, as you said, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4059.12s)]
*  swings all the way back this way. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4061.12s)]
*  There's all these cockamamie idiots [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4062.16s)]
*  getting momentary support online right now. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4063.16s)]
*  Once that's out of the system [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4066.16s)]
*  and we become almost desensitized to this, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4068.16s)]
*  we're starting to become desensitized [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4070.16s)]
*  to our alternative history even. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4072.16s)]
*  We're like, okay, another thing. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4073.16s)]
*  I think that comes, I don't think it continues to go up. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4074.16s)]
*  Naturally, as a Jewish person, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4077.16s)]
*  I imagine there's a lot of fear about this [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4079.16s)]
*  because it's ratcheted up before even crazier. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4081.16s)]
*  But I think it comes back down. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4083.16s)]
*  But what's the force that brings? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4085.16s)]
*  See, I just... [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4087.16s)]
*  Exhaustion. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4088.16s)]
*  Yeah, and numbness. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4089.16s)]
*  And numbness. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4090.16s)]
*  And numbness. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4091.2s)]
*  And normalization. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4092.2s)]
*  We're just numb to shit now. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4093.2s)]
*  We just eventually get numb, unfortunately. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4095.2s)]
*  Look at Kanye. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4099.2s)]
*  He's walking around with a swastika shirt. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4100.2s)]
*  And we're just like, oh, Kanye. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4102.2s)]
*  It's just this eye roll. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4104.2s)]
*  He's become an eye roll. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4106.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4107.2s)]
*  I think one way to look at it is [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4108.2s)]
*  we're numb and exhausted and it's an eye roll. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4109.2s)]
*  The other way to look at it is, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4111.2s)]
*  oh, something that had a... [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4112.2s)]
*  There are certain taboos that shouldn't be taboo. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4115.2s)]
*  And I think that's what happened under this censorious age, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4118.2s)]
*  is like, it became taboo [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4120.24s)]
*  to say that men and women are different. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4122.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4124.24s)]
*  And in reaction to the over-taboo-ification [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4125.24s)]
*  of everything, now it's like, screw that. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4128.24s)]
*  We should have no taboos at all. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4131.24s)]
*  I'm going to put a swastika on a t-shirt. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4132.24s)]
*  Exactly, yes. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4134.24s)]
*  But it's like, but there actually are certain taboos [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4135.24s)]
*  that are good. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4138.24s)]
*  I don't want to walk through the world [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4139.24s)]
*  and have someone spit on me [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4141.24s)]
*  because I'm married to a woman. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4142.24s)]
*  Of course. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4144.24s)]
*  Like, I'm glad that taboo exists. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4145.24s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4146.24s)]
*  But anything... [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4147.28s)]
*  Because that movement was so censorious, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4148.28s)]
*  anything that's even criticism of the swastika [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4151.28s)]
*  is now like, what are you, cancel culture? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4154.28s)]
*  And it's like, no, dude. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4156.28s)]
*  Like, I just think Nazis are bad still. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4158.28s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4160.28s)]
*  And how do you avoid that trap? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4161.28s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4163.28s)]
*  It's like, what people in the right, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4164.28s)]
*  or the extreme right, we should say, rather, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4167.28s)]
*  what they don't realize is that that's the behavior [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4169.28s)]
*  that brings back censorship. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4171.28s)]
*  So the reason there's speech in the media [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4173.28s)]
*  is the reason there's speed limits [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4176.32s)]
*  is because somebody's in the Ferrari [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4178.32s)]
*  pushing the pedal all the way down. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4180.32s)]
*  And then that asshole mows down people [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4182.32s)]
*  and then we all go, all right, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4184.32s)]
*  you can't go faster than 65 [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4186.32s)]
*  because these fucking idiots don't realize [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4188.32s)]
*  that it's dangerous for everybody. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4190.32s)]
*  So that behavior is what brings about more censorship. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4192.32s)]
*  Now, I don't know if it's the censorship [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4194.32s)]
*  that's going to bring us back [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4196.32s)]
*  or it's just the exhaustion, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4198.32s)]
*  but there's no question in my mind [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4200.32s)]
*  we eventually just get back to this middle ground [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4202.32s)]
*  and we'll be there for a little [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4204.32s)]
*  bit more censorship and more censorship [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4205.36s)]
*  and then we'll break free of that [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4207.36s)]
*  and the pendulum of American culture [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4209.36s)]
*  will continue to swing. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4211.36s)]
*  You're a comedian. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4213.36s)]
*  I think you're sort of like an unlikely host [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4214.36s)]
*  of a presidential candidate, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4216.36s)]
*  our future president, but there you were. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4218.36s)]
*  The thing that has gotten a lot of my attention recently [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4220.36s)]
*  and I'm wondering if you've even seen this [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4223.36s)]
*  is that one of the Kennedy's, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4225.36s)]
*  this kid, Jack Schlossberg, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4227.36s)]
*  I think that's his last name, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4229.36s)]
*  he goes, he's really cute. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4231.36s)]
*  It's unclear if it's camp [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4233.36s)]
*  or if he's actually out of his mind. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4234.4s)]
*  I think it's camp. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4236.4s)]
*  Everyone in this office watches his videos [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4237.4s)]
*  and he keeps baiting you [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4239.4s)]
*  and challenging you. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4241.4s)]
*  So I guess this guy is like trolling me [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4242.4s)]
*  on the internet and I think it comes from, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4244.4s)]
*  I said this thing, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4246.4s)]
*  which like Democrats got really pissed off about, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4248.4s)]
*  I said I don't know a man over 5'9'' [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4250.4s)]
*  that identifies as a Democrat. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4254.4s)]
*  And I don't. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4260.4s)]
*  Like I don't know one who's like, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4261.4s)]
*  not saying they won't vote Democrat, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4263.44s)]
*  but like I identify, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4265.44s)]
*  it's like I'm a proud Democrat [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4266.44s)]
*  and it ate away at like Democrats [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4268.44s)]
*  because I think that they were forced [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4272.44s)]
*  to kind of like look at the fact [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4274.44s)]
*  that there's a missing bit of masculinity [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4276.44s)]
*  that exists within the party. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4279.44s)]
*  Again, keep in mind, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4280.44s)]
*  I grew up in a fucking dance family in New York City. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4281.44s)]
*  I've been a Democrat my entire life. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4283.44s)]
*  So what I'm trying to talk about is not politics, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4285.44s)]
*  I'm trying to talk about culture and perception. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4288.44s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4290.48s)]
*  And everyone, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4291.48s)]
*  like it's known that Republicans are getting the bill, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4292.48s)]
*  Democrats are getting the female vote, blah blah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4294.48s)]
*  When I was growing up, Democrats got all the pussy. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4296.48s)]
*  Bill Clinton was getting laid left and right [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4298.48s)]
*  and Republicans were like, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4300.48s)]
*  you better get married and wait to have kids [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4302.48s)]
*  and don't use bad words. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4304.48s)]
*  Now it's like have a harem, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4305.48s)]
*  you can be a Republican. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4306.48s)]
*  Now Republicans get all the pussy. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4307.48s)]
*  Why do you think guys are going, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4309.48s)]
*  yeah I kind of like them a little bit more. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4311.48s)]
*  Go back to Jack Schlossberg. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4312.48s)]
*  So yeah, so he's like, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4313.48s)]
*  he just keeps making these videos [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4314.48s)]
*  and then like I actually hit up RFK. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4316.48s)]
*  I was like, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4318.48s)]
*  what's going on with this guy? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4319.5199999999995s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4320.5199999999995s)]
*  He was like, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4321.5199999999995s)]
*  yeah I think he's got some meltdowns. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4322.5199999999995s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4323.5199999999995s)]
*  He kept telling me my wife is dry. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4324.5199999999995s)]
*  What? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4325.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, like her pussy's dry or whatever. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4326.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4328.5199999999995s)]
*  that seems like a weird kind of thing. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4329.5199999999995s)]
*  But then I looked into the kid a little bit more [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4331.5199999999995s)]
*  and like this is like the perfect, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4333.5199999999995s)]
*  okay so what I'll say is this, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4335.5199999999995s)]
*  his bravado is the right messaging [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4337.5199999999995s)]
*  but he's doing the thing that Democrats shouldn't do [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4342.5199999999995s)]
*  is attacking the figures instead of the ideas. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4345.56s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4349.56s)]
*  So like he's talking about RFK [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4350.56s)]
*  or he's talking about Tulsi [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4351.56s)]
*  or he's talking about me [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4352.56s)]
*  or he's talking about Trump. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4353.56s)]
*  It's like the people decided that they like that. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4354.56s)]
*  So what you have to do is attack the ideas. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4357.56s)]
*  And he's speaking a little bit more relatably. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4360.56s)]
*  I think a lot of times like Democrats [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4363.56s)]
*  are like a little scared to say anything. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4364.56s)]
*  Clenched. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4366.56s)]
*  Clenched. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4367.56s)]
*  That was the nice thing about like Jasmine Crockett [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4368.56s)]
*  like when she was like, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4369.56s)]
*  yeah he's Putin's hoe. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4370.56s)]
*  It's like, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4371.56s)]
*  ooh I like that. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4372.56s)]
*  Talk in a way that I can relate to. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4373.6s)]
*  Talk like a real human being. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4375.6s)]
*  That's one of the things that [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4376.6s)]
*  despite being a fucking billionaire [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4377.6s)]
*  is relatable about Trump, right? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4378.6s)]
*  Is that he talks like a regular dude. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4379.6s)]
*  The Indian guy is asking him a question. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4381.6s)]
*  The journalist is, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4383.6s)]
*  he's doing the dibble dabble dibble dabble [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4384.6s)]
*  and Trump is just like, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4386.6s)]
*  what the fuck is this guy saying? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4387.6s)]
*  I have no clue. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4388.6s)]
*  That's a relatable moment, right? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4389.6s)]
*  So I think what he's, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4391.6s)]
*  his like form of communication isn't off per se [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4392.6s)]
*  but the problem with him is that [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4395.6s)]
*  he's a like fifth generation trust fund Nebo baby. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4398.6s)]
*  Like he's never had a real job. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4403.6s)]
*  So I don't need a kid who's never had a real job [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4405.6s)]
*  and never earned anything in his entire life [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4409.6s)]
*  finger wagging at me [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4411.6s)]
*  or the average working class American. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4414.6s)]
*  The problem with the Democrat party is that [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4417.6s)]
*  they've kind of become like hijacked [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4419.6s)]
*  by these like Ivy League Nebo babies [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4421.6s)]
*  and I don't know why they've virtually, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4423.6s)]
*  I don't know if it's a guilt [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4426.6s)]
*  that they've never accomplished anything [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4427.6s)]
*  so they need to prove that they're a good person. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4428.6s)]
*  Like I don't know if it's a lack of like [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4430.6s)]
*  self-esteem. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4432.64s)]
*  I don't know what it is [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4433.64s)]
*  but nobody wants to be told what to do [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4434.64s)]
*  or who to vote for [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4437.64s)]
*  from a guy who's never had a job [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4438.64s)]
*  from a guy who like is still existing [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4440.64s)]
*  off of like a trust fund. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4443.64s)]
*  This is not the position to be in. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4445.64s)]
*  It's not relatable. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4447.64s)]
*  The reality is it's more damage to the party [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4448.64s)]
*  than it is good. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4451.64s)]
*  The party itself doesn't need that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4452.64s)]
*  They need like low key AOC, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4455.64s)]
*  like her politics or don't like her politics. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4457.64s)]
*  Her district believes that she wants to help. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4460.68s)]
*  They see her as one of them. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4463.68s)]
*  I think her district pulled the same for Trump [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4465.68s)]
*  as it did for her. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4467.68s)]
*  What does that say? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4468.68s)]
*  They did. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4469.68s)]
*  We went out and interviewed a lot of those people. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4470.68s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4472.68s)]
*  Because they think they're speaking to them. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4473.68s)]
*  Okay, we're doing a one minute lightning round. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4475.68s)]
*  You ready? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4478.68s)]
*  Andrew Schultz, top three comedians working today. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4479.68s)]
*  Who are your faves? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4482.68s)]
*  Or some of your faves? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4483.68s)]
*  This is a great question. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4484.68s)]
*  I'm excluding myself from this. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4487.68s)]
*  Because of arrogance. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4489.72s)]
*  It would be too arrogant. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4491.72s)]
*  But that's my way of saying I'm number one. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4492.72s)]
*  Who's number two and three? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4495.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4496.72s)]

*  David Tell is just like, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4502.72s)]

*  He just continues to be absolutely phenomenal. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4506.72s)]
*  I want to give you more of like a deep cut one [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4509.72s)]
*  that I did like as somebody that... [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4511.72s)]
*  Jerry Seinfeld was telling me about a woman, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4513.72s)]
*  a blonde midwestern woman. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4515.76s)]
*  She has a special on Netflix. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4518.76s)]
*  I've got to look her up. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4520.76s)]

*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4537.76s)]
*  Women aren't funny. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4538.76s)]
*  No, they are funny. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4539.76s)]
*  They can be. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4540.76s)]
*  They are. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4541.76s)]
*  What's something your kid does that makes you laugh? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4542.76s)]
*  She goes, when she wants me to come to her, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8WB_7OYNl8&t=4544.8s)]
