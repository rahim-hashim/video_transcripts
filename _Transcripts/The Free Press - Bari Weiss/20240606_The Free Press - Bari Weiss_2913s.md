At the start of the twentieth century, Argentina was one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The capital, Buenos Aires, was known as “the Paris of South America.”

A lot can happen in a hundred years. Argentina today is in grave crisis. It has defaulted on its sovereign debt three times since 2001, and a few months ago it faced an annualized inflation rate of over 200 percent—one of the highest in the world. What happened?

Today's guest, Argentina’s new president, says it’s pretty simple: socialism.

# Argentina’s President Javier Milei Has a Plan for His Country—Will It Work? Honestly with Bari Weiss
**The Free Press - Bari Weiss:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI)
*  Do you like being the skunk at the garden party? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of people have pegged one word to Argentina's new president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=16.12s)]
*  And that is crazy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=19.8s)]
*  He's known across Latin America as El Loco. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=21.8s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop, stop! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=24.92s)]
*  Headlines about Argentina's president, Javier Malé, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=27.96s)]
*  range from him being a tantric sex guru [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=31.12s)]
*  And you still have tantric sex? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=33.36s)]
*  I heard you once talking about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=35.52s)]
*  Did you practice? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=37.72s)]
*  Yes, of course. I was a teacher. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  to his four cloned mastiffs that he named after libertarian icons he loves. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=40.6s)]
*  But all of that, his crazy hair, that's the superficial stuff. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=45.64s)]
*  What makes Javier truly unusual are his ideas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=49.72s)]
*  In a country that has been dominated by socialism for a century, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=54.12s)]
*  policies that took Argentina from being one of the wealthiest countries in the world [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=57.96s)]
*  to a country facing 200% inflation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=62.72s)]
*  he wants to take the country in a radically different direction. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=66.2s)]
*  Malé is a proud libertarian, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=69.92s)]
*  actually calls himself an anarcho-capitalist, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=71.88s)]
*  and says that the best person to fix the state [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=74.72s)]
*  is the person who hates the state. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=77.32s)]
*  During his campaign, Malé made his intentions clear. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  And that he should be put in all this garbage of political caste. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=84.08s)]
*  Which is exactly what he's now doing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=87.76s)]
*  Malé has introduced the most radical austerity measures in modern Argentina. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=89.92s)]
*  This is why people voted for him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=94.6s)]
*  Change. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=96.32s)]
*  Someone who could shake things up in a way that could turn out to be life-saving, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=97.28s)]
*  even if it meant short-term economic pain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  People were sold on his ideas [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=103.84s)]
*  and willing to sacrifice for the Malé project and the future of the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=106.0s)]
*  But will it work? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=110.6s)]
*  Not all Argentinians think so, at least not right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=112.04s)]
*  And not everyone is willing or able to wait for things to improve. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=115.16s)]
*  In April, with food prices rising and poverty up 10%, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=119.32s)]
*  tens of thousands of Argentinians took to the streets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=123.2s)]
*  to protest Malé's aggressive measures. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=126.04s)]
*  A few months ago, Malé showed up at Davos, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=129.28s)]
*  the Alpine mountain resort that hosts the annual World Economic Forum. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=131.52s)]
*  This is a place where, historically, people who all think the same way [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=135.56s)]
*  go to drink expensive champagne and tell each other how smart they are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=138.16s)]
*  But there Malé was. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  He arrived flying commercial. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=142.76s)]
*  And he blew all of that up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  He got on stage and said, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  listen, you're not all that smart and, by the way, you're wrong. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=147.64s)]
*  Here's what he said in his speech. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=151.2s)]
*  Today, I'm here to tell you that the Western world is in danger. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  And it is in danger because those who are supposed to have to defend [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  the values of the West are co-opted by a vision of the world [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  that inexorably leads to socialism and thereby to poverty. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=169.52s)]
*  Whatever you think about his ideas, whatever you think about that speech, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=174.0s)]
*  it was undeniable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=177.8s)]
*  His appearance there was electric, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=179.4s)]
*  all of which is why I was so excited to sit down with him today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  And despite having called journalists extortionists, liars, imbeciles, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=185.44s)]
*  freeloaders, donkeys and ignorant, for some reason, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=188.68s)]
*  he decided to sit down with me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=191.52s)]
*  Here's my interview with Argentinian President Javier Malé. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=193.52s)]
*  President Malé, welcome to Honestly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=200.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. It's a pleasure for me to be here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=203.52s)]
*  I know you've been in meetings today with Mark Zuckerberg [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=206.52s)]
*  and other leaders in Silicon Valley. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=208.52s)]
*  Earlier this week, he spoke down the road at Stanford University. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=210.52s)]
*  For months, students at that university have been calling for intifada. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=214.52s)]
*  They've been chanting on behalf of groups like Hamas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=219.52s)]
*  These are meant to be some of the best and brightest students, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=223.52s)]
*  not just in America, but in the entire West. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=228.52s)]
*  And I wonder how you understand the appeal of intifada [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=231.52s)]
*  and the sort of self-destructive impulse that's taken hold [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=237.52s)]
*  among so many of the smartest people in this country [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=242.52s)]
*  and across the Western world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=246.52s)]
*  Basically, we were putting obstacles and we were hindering [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=257.52s)]
*  those values that made the West great. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=263.52s)]
*  And that's happening because basically socialism has won the cultural battle. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=269.52s)]
*  Wrongly, liberals or libertarians believe that with the fall of the wall, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=277.52s)]
*  we bought the idea of Fukushima at the end of history [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=284.52s)]
*  and that socialism was literally dead. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=289.52s)]
*  However, socialism regrouped in the San Pablo Forum, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=294.52s)]
*  and it moved the class struggle that Marxism originally posed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=298.52s)]
*  to the rest of society's aspects. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=304.52s)]
*  And with a strategy called the Gramsci, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=307.52s)]
*  it got into the state, it got into the positions of the state, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=311.52s)]
*  it got into education and it got into the media and culture. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=315.52s)]
*  And in that way, they fought the cultural battle and won it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=321.52s)]
*  Not because they were better than the ideas of freedom, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=328.52s)]
*  but because the fact that the libertarians didn't fight. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=332.52s)]
*  And today, in the United States, we can see how they won the cultural battle. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=337.52s)]
*  And that makes it so that today in the United States, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=343.52s)]
*  the Jewish students are persecuted, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=348.52s)]
*  a situation that could later spread to the rest of the Jews [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=351.52s)]
*  and then to the rest of the Westerners. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=357.52s)]
*  And they also end up defending killings groups, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=360.52s)]
*  as in the case of Hamas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=367.52s)]
*  And that is a consequence of the fact that they have fought the cultural battle. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=369.52s)]
*  In fact, the left is so fundamentalist in this, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=374.52s)]
*  that in my country and in other countries, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=378.52s)]
*  people from the left, even with Jewish origins, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=383.52s)]
*  are on the side of the terrorists or terrorist groups, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=388.52s)]
*  as in the case of Hamas. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=393.52s)]
*  And they even condemn the government of Israel [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=395.52s)]
*  for defending themselves, for making use of their legitimate defense. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=398.52s)]
*  And that is a consequence of the fact that the libertarians [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=402.52s)]
*  have not fought the cultural battle. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=406.52s)]
*  And that is why I said in Davos that the West is in danger. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=409.52s)]
*  But there are two very positive things. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=415.52s)]
*  First, someone who comes from the cultural battle, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=419.52s)]
*  as is my case, and who seemed impossible to get to power. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=424.52s)]
*  Let's say I became president of a country that for 100 years [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=429.52s)]
*  embraced these nasty and socialist ideas, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=434.52s)]
*  which have made Argentina the richest country in the world [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=437.52s)]
*  and the world became the 140th. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=441.52s)]
*  And today we have 55% of the poor and 15% of the people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=444.52s)]
*  What I am warning is that it is not necessary [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=450.52s)]
*  for the world to suffer such a debacle [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=454.52s)]
*  to escape the ideas of socialism. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=457.52s)]
*  And one of the things I usually say, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=460.52s)]
*  I come from an apocalyptic future to avoid it, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=463.52s)]
*  is something like the story of Terminator. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=467.52s)]
*  Well, in fact, Schwarzenegger is the libertarian. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=470.52s)]
*  But apart from the risuene issue, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=476.52s)]
*  this is because the cultural battle has not been fought. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=480.52s)]
*  But someone who comes to the battle, as is my case, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=484.52s)]
*  has been able to get to power. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=487.52s)]
*  That is one thing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=489.52s)]
*  And second, when it comes to power, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=491.52s)]
*  I never stopped fighting the cultural battle. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=496.52s)]
*  And now the microphone is much bigger, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=498.52s)]
*  the level of reach is greater. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=501.52s)]
*  The things I said in Davos, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=503.52s)]
*  I have been saying them for a long time, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=505.52s)]
*  but saying them as president of a country [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=507.52s)]
*  and being the first libertarian president [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=509.52s)]
*  in the history of humanity, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=512.52s)]
*  the effect is much greater. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=514.52s)]
*  And the most positive part is that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=516.52s)]
*  from these speeches, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=520.52s)]
*  many people are waking up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=522.52s)]
*  In fact, when I started my political career, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=524.52s)]
*  my first political speech, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=527.52s)]
*  when I closed the speech, I said, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=529.52s)]
*  I don't come here to guide lambs, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=531.52s)]
*  I come to wake up lions. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=534.52s)]
*  And fortunately, what I am seeing is that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=536.52s)]
*  at the global level, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=539.52s)]
*  there are many libertarian lions waking up. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=541.52s)]
*  Therefore, although the present is looking dark, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=543.52s)]
*  I think the foundations of a much better future are flourishing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=549.52s)]
*  Do you see those lions awakening only in Argentina [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=555.52s)]
*  or all over the world? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=558.52s)]
*  And where do you see them here, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=560.52s)]
*  given that you've been here for the past few days? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=562.52s)]
*  Two things. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=564.52s)]
*  In the case of Argentina, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=566.52s)]
*  God is more evident [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=568.52s)]
*  because we have been here for 100 years of dedication, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=570.52s)]
*  because against all odds, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=574.52s)]
*  we have won the presidency [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=577.52s)]
*  and things are really incredible. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=580.52s)]
*  I have been telling in different meetings [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=585.52s)]
*  that, incredibly, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=589.52s)]
*  while we are making the biggest tax adjustment [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=591.52s)]
*  in the history of humanity [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=593.52s)]
*  and when in Argentine history [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=595.52s)]
*  the ministers of economy, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=597.52s)]
*  the most they could aspire to, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=599.52s)]
*  was not to be insulted, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=601.52s)]
*  every time I go to an event with my minister of economy, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=603.52s)]
*  my minister of economy is devastated. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=605.52s)]
*  Not only that, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=607.52s)]
*  if we look at my image, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=609.52s)]
*  my image is higher than the one I assumed, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=612.52s)]
*  despite making this adjustment. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=616.52s)]
*  In fact, the approval of management has also improved [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=618.52s)]
*  and not only that, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=623.52s)]
*  if we were to go to an election today, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=625.52s)]
*  we would be able to get 60% of the votes. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=627.52s)]
*  And that, in reality, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=630.52s)]
*  beyond the dynamics of images, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=632.52s)]
*  intentions of votes and so on, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=634.52s)]
*  the most important thing is that it means a change of time. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=636.52s)]
*  That is, we are doing this, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=641.52s)]
*  it is an absolutely painful situation, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=643.52s)]
*  but people interpreted and assimilated [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=646.52s)]
*  that all the shortcuts of populism and socialism do not work. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=650.52s)]
*  And that is an element to be very optimistic. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=654.52s)]
*  And regarding the world, I am also very optimistic, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=657.52s)]
*  because to achieve this in Argentina, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=661.52s)]
*  I was giving the cultural battle for ten years before. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=664.52s)]
*  In fact, I usually tell you that when I started giving the cultural battle in the media, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=669.52s)]
*  I was more alone than Adán on Mother's Day. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=673.52s)]
*  And in that sense, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=676.52s)]
*  what I notice is that the world is much more open [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=680.52s)]
*  and the mechanism through which these ideas are spread in the world is much faster. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=686.52s)]
*  And regarding what you told me about the talks I have had these days [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=693.52s)]
*  with different technological giants, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=701.52s)]
*  they are deeply committed to the ideas of freedom [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=705.52s)]
*  and they feel deeply attractive with my libertarian vision of the world [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=710.52s)]
*  and my hatred of regulations. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=715.52s)]
*  Well, that wonderful human capital [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=723.52s)]
*  that you have created in all of America, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=729.52s)]
*  the reason that a terrible two-bedroom house costs $2 million, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=732.52s)]
*  $3 million here in Palo Alto is because they want to be around other brilliant people-building companies. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=738.52s)]
*  Because of Argentina's economic collapse [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=743.52s)]
*  and because of the double-digit inflation over the past decades, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=746.52s)]
*  your human capital has fled. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=750.52s)]
*  The wonderful thing that Argentina has and that has left the country [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=752.52s)]
*  has left because it was systematically attacked by the state. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=759.52s)]
*  It was systematically attacked by inflation. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=764.52s)]
*  We have taken away 13 zeros from the currency, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=768.52s)]
*  not only that, but also, today we could take away 3 more zeros from the currency. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=772.52s)]
*  Also, Argentina, in the last 10 years, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=779.52s)]
*  its GDP per capita has fallen by about 15%. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=784.52s)]
*  If we look at the history of the last 100 years, it is clearly a catastrophe [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=787.52s)]
*  because it is the richest country in the world or one of the five richest in the world, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=791.52s)]
*  today it is 140. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=795.52s)]
*  We have 55% poor and 15% poor. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=797.52s)]
*  So, it has become a very aggressive place for anyone [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=801.52s)]
*  and anyone who has human capital will leave because they are being attacked. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=806.52s)]
*  In fact, that repulsive, repulsive idea of social justice [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=812.52s)]
*  is precisely what attacks human capital. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=819.52s)]
*  Because if you study, work, work hard and you do well, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=822.52s)]
*  the state will come and steal your money and give it to someone who did nothing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=826.52s)]
*  And that is a mechanism to expel talent. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=831.52s)]
*  Well, we are rewinding 100 years of history, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=834.52s)]
*  and I tell you with two things only. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=839.52s)]
*  In the first months, let's say, specifically in the first month of government, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=842.52s)]
*  we sent a thousand structural reforms. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=847.52s)]
*  In fact, the biggest structural reform that had been done in Argentina was in the 90s with MENEM. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=850.52s)]
*  And if today the basic law ends in Congress and the DNU is in force, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=856.52s)]
*  our reform is eight times bigger than MENEM's. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=863.52s)]
*  Not only that, but also this reform would imply that Argentina [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=867.52s)]
*  took a leap in economic freedom of 90 positions. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=872.52s)]
*  In fact, it would begin to resemble countries like Germany, like Italy, like France. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=876.52s)]
*  However, that is not our goal. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=882.52s)]
*  We want to be the country with the highest economic freedom in the world. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=884.52s)]
*  That is, to replicate the miracle, for example, of Ireland, which is the most miserable country in Europe, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=888.52s)]
*  today has a GDP per capita of 50% higher than that of the United States, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=893.52s)]
*  or be like Switzerland, or be like Luxembourg, or be like Australia or New Zealand, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=897.52s)]
*  despite the retractions that they are having in terms of economic freedom. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=903.52s)]
*  But even when those were good models, we are much more ambitious. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=908.52s)]
*  We still have 3,200 more structural reforms pending, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=914.52s)]
*  and we are now beginning to analyze certain regulations that are much more complex to trace, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=918.52s)]
*  but in fact we are going to start doing work with artificial intelligence [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=928.52s)]
*  to start cleaning up all those gaps that are stopping the progress of Argentina. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=932.52s)]
*  So in that sense we are very optimistic, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=938.52s)]
*  because not only are we fighting this battle economically and politically, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=943.52s)]
*  we have not abandoned the cultural battle. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=949.52s)]
*  And all this will generate a situation where Argentina will grow again very strongly. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=952.52s)]
*  In fact, one of the things we are looking for is that Argentina becomes one of the four poles of artificial intelligence in the world. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=958.52s)]
*  Because you have a super regulated Europe, and therefore it cannot expand, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=966.52s)]
*  you have the United States with an absolutely dreadful, warm, gray situation, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=970.52s)]
*  and you have China that does not know what you are doing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=975.52s)]
*  So we are proposing to these large companies that come and settle in Argentina [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=978.52s)]
*  and that we recreate paradise from Argentina. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=984.52s)]
*  Not only will the Argentines who left come back, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=987.52s)]
*  but also other talented people in the world will come to Argentina, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=989.52s)]
*  because we are going to make Argentina a paradise. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=994.52s)]
*  So you are actually at meta recruiting people? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=997.52s)]
*  No, I am convincing them to come, not only the meta people, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1000.52s)]
*  but also the people of Apple and Google, and also the companies of the most. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1004.52s)]
*  Never in the history of Argentina did a president have the possibility [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1011.52s)]
*  to talk to all the most important businessmen in the world. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1016.52s)]
*  Therefore, this is quite novel. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1020.52s)]
*  It means that we are an interesting house. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1023.52s)]
*  You warned people when you were running for office that this is what it was going to look like. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1053.52s)]
*  You were going to have to force pain, you called it fiscal shock therapy, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1058.52s)]
*  and things were going to get worse before they get better. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1061.52s)]
*  But now people in your country are saying, I can't afford milk, I can't afford eggs, I can't afford meat. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1064.52s)]
*  What do you say to the people who are so far away from this economic vision that you are heralding? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1069.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, what we have to be clear about is the situation in which we assume. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1075.52s)]
*  When a country has a total deficit, that is, both fiscal and external, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1082.52s)]
*  for four points of the PBI, it is a yellow alert. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1088.52s)]
*  When you have a deficit of eight points of the PBI, it is a red alert, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1092.52s)]
*  and you are going to go to a huge crisis, like the great crises that Argentina had. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1096.52s)]
*  We inherited 17 points of the PBI. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1101.52s)]
*  The size of the problem we have inherited does not enter the heads of any human. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1105.52s)]
*  Of those 17 points, 15 were generated by the government, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1110.52s)]
*  where 5 were in the treasury and 10 in the central bank. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1117.52s)]
*  So the question is, we had that deficit of 15 points of the PBI that we had to implement, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1122.52s)]
*  while inflation, when we arrived, for example, in December, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1130.52s)]
*  in mayoral, it was 54% monthly. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1137.52s)]
*  That, annualized, gives 17,000%. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1142.52s)]
*  Therefore, Argentina was on the way to hyperinflation, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1145.52s)]
*  which was going to leave 95% of the poor and 60% of the homeless. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1149.52s)]
*  That was what we were facing. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1156.52s)]
*  As a consequence of this, we decided to make a fiscal adjustment, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1160.52s)]
*  for several reasons. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1165.52s)]
*  First, because all the shock adjustments, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1168.52s)]
*  including the 59 in Argentina, were successful, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1172.52s)]
*  and all the gradual adjustments were failures. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1176.52s)]
*  Second, to make a gradual fiscal adjustment, you need funding, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1180.52s)]
*  and Argentina had fallen to the financing of the International Monetary Fund. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1186.52s)]
*  When you are going to make a shock adjustment, it implies an increase in savings, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1192.52s)]
*  and since Argentina did not generate any kind of trust, it did not have a counterparty of investment. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1196.52s)]
*  And therefore, you were necessarily going to be recessive. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1202.52s)]
*  And we explain that to society. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1207.52s)]
*  It is true that Argentina has just had a very strong recession, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1210.52s)]
*  but it is also true that the data from April and May begin to give signs of recovery. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1213.52s)]
*  And the major inflation, which came at 54% monthly, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1219.52s)]
*  has now dropped by 3.5%, and inflation continues to drop. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1224.52s)]
*  In fact, in the last two months, salaries began to earn, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1228.52s)]
*  not only does it earn the prices, but it is also earning the prices of food. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1234.52s)]
*  Therefore, it is true that the picture is tremendous, but the movie is fabulous. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1241.52s)]
*  In fact, when we assumed, 85% of the people said it was bad. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1248.52s)]
*  Today, 65% of the people say it is bad. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1254.52s)]
*  It is a horrible number, but it dropped 20 points, and that in five months is almost miraculous. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1258.52s)]
*  And now I am going to pass on another important fact. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1264.52s)]
*  When we assumed, only 20% thought that in a year we would be better. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1267.52s)]
*  And today that number is 55%. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1274.52s)]
*  Therefore, I understand that the situation is bad, but towards the future it is better. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1277.52s)]
*  The alternative was to continue doing what we did before, we would have flown through the air. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1282.52s)]
*  I don't have to deal with emotions. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1292.52s)]
*  I mean, I talk about numbers and reality, not emotions. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1294.52s)]
*  Let's say, because a person, for example, let's say, a person, let's say, has a Lamborghini. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1297.52s)]
*  So, what are the emotions of who has a Lamborghini? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1311.52s)]
*  I don't know, because probably if, let's say, he is in a place where he is very poor, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1317.52s)]
*  it may be that he feels very good with his Lamborghini. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1323.52s)]
*  But if he lives in a place where everyone has 15 Lamborghinis, he feels miserable. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1326.52s)]
*  So, I can't deal with emotions, I can only deal with reality. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1332.52s)]
*  Let's go by parts. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1346.52s)]
*  First of all, for example, today there is 15% of the population who is indigent. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1348.52s)]
*  That is, they do not manage to satisfy the basic needs. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1353.52s)]
*  If we had continued doing what was being done, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1357.52s)]
*  we would have been able to do the same things that we are doing now. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1363.52s)]
*  Therefore, let's say, one cannot fall into what is called the fallacy of paradise. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1369.52s)]
*  That is, let's say, if you are going to compare me to paradise, life is always horrible. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1376.52s)]
*  Now, if we compare ourselves to the alternative scenario, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1381.52s)]
*  let's say, if we compare ourselves to the alternative scenario, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1385.52s)]
*  we are always going to see that life is always horrible. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1388.52s)]
*  Now, if we compare ourselves to the alternative scenario, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1393.52s)]
*  let's say, 60% of the indigent would have been a real catastrophe, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1397.52s)]
*  worse than the one we have now, which is 15%. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1401.52s)]
*  First point. Second point. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1404.52s)]
*  Today, food inflation is very, very below the evolution of wages, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1407.52s)]
*  with which in terms of food, wages are rising a lot. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1416.52s)]
*  In fact, wages are rising in real terms because the last two months [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1421.52s)]
*  inflation was gaining and much more to food. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1426.52s)]
*  Therefore, today people go to the supermarket. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1430.52s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1434.52s)]
*  When we assumed it was 70% of the people considered that prices were going to continue to rise. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1437.52s)]
*  And the remaining 30%, about 27, considered that in the best of cases they were going to be stable [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1448.52s)]
*  and someone considered, and three points that could fall. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1455.52s)]
*  Today, the number of people, let's say, who say that prices are rising is at 40%. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1458.52s)]
*  And 60% say that prices are either stable or they are falling. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1466.52s)]
*  In fact, it is the first time in 25 years that people's majority opinion is that inflation is going to fall [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1471.52s)]
*  and some say that there will also be deflation. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1480.52s)]
*  Therefore, let's say, it is working. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1484.52s)]
*  People are seeing it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1486.52s)]
*  If they don't see it in the media, if we take away their advertising guidelines [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1488.52s)]
*  and lie about the things we do, it is a problem of the media that lie [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1492.52s)]
*  because they ran out of state money. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1497.52s)]
*  But reality breaks their eyes all the time. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1500.52s)]
*  I understand that the media are horrible because I took away their state money. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1504.52s)]
*  I truly believe in free press. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1512.52s)]
*  And when the press receives money from the state, it is not free. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1515.52s)]
*  It is a slave of the state. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1518.52s)]
*  So we take away the guidelines and that is why they lie. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1520.52s)]
*  If what the media say were true, this government would have burst out. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1524.52s)]
*  And yet, my image grows all the time. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1532.52s)]
*  You describe yourself as an anarcho-capitalist, someone who thinks centralized states should be abolished, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1535.52s)]
*  that private corporations should fulfill all of the state's current duties, like schooling, defense, and building roads. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1541.52s)]
*  Are there certain things though that the state must do and what are those things? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1548.52s)]
*  I am philosophically anarcho-capitalist. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1565.52s)]
*  I consider the state to be a criminal organization. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1569.52s)]
*  For example, are you in favor of theft? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1573.52s)]
*  No. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1576.52s)]
*  Okay, neither am I. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1577.52s)]
*  However, you don't voluntarily pay taxes. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1579.52s)]
*  If you don't pay your taxes, you go to jail. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1583.52s)]
*  So the opposite of that is that there is institutionalized violence. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1586.52s)]
*  What happens is that there are thieves with a license, the state, and there are thieves without a license. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1591.52s)]
*  But in reality, you could take a band of thieves and if the state proclaims itself, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1600.52s)]
*  it would not have any difference with what the state is. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1604.52s)]
*  And that is what anarcho-capitalist libertarians understand. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1607.52s)]
*  The state is a violent organization that lives from a coactive source of income called taxes. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1613.52s)]
*  Taxes don't look very friendly to us. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1619.52s)]
*  In fact, it is a remora of slavery. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1622.52s)]
*  But that is an ideal world. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1624.52s)]
*  And I understand that this is an ideal world. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1626.52s)]
*  And that is the ideal that I point to. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1628.52s)]
*  And in the real world, the real world has many complications. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1631.52s)]
*  In fact, in real life I am a monarchist. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1635.52s)]
*  One has to look at that North and design their policies to achieve freedom. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1637.52s)]
*  Because I also find it an absolutely stupid position of some libertarians [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1645.52s)]
*  who say that they have to stay outside, that is, the agorists. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1652.52s)]
*  I would say that the agorists, more than agorists, are stupid. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1658.52s)]
*  Because I know an agorist, for example, who considers himself an agorist, and that we have to fight against the state. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1661.52s)]
*  And in the middle of the pandemic he was having a party, which was prohibited. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1670.52s)]
*  And I accidentally called him to greet him. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1675.52s)]
*  And the police had just gone to see him. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1679.52s)]
*  And this so agorist, who was willing to fight against the state, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1682.52s)]
*  almost peed on him. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1687.52s)]
*  So, or those who say that the possession of a real libertarian should be changing the system. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1690.52s)]
*  Now, the system changes being inside, not from the outside. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1697.52s)]
*  That is, no politician is going to change a system that benefits him in favor of the people, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1700.52s)]
*  because he has the power to do it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1709.52s)]
*  So, I'm going to give you an easier example. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1711.52s)]
*  In Argentina, soccer, football, is the most popular sport. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1714.52s)]
*  When you go to a soccer stadium, it's a beautiful show. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1719.52s)]
*  A lot of people in the stands, very colorful. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1728.52s)]
*  People sing very beautiful songs. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1736.52s)]
*  But if you put the ball in the middle of the field, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1739.52s)]
*  no matter how much people scream, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1743.52s)]
*  no matter how much their flags shake, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1746.52s)]
*  the ball doesn't move. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1749.52s)]
*  If you want to win the game, you need players. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1753.52s)]
*  In the Argentinean section, Messi scores the goals. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1756.52s)]
*  That is, you need someone to score the goals. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1759.52s)]
*  So, that idea that from the stands you can change something is stupid. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1761.52s)]
*  Much more stupid is to believe that you can do it from, let's say, sitting in the living room of your house. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1766.52s)]
*  So, the only way to modify this is to get inside the system [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1772.52s)]
*  and dispute power, because otherwise you're not going to change it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1778.52s)]
*  Is there something about libertarian ideology that creates that phenomenon? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1802.52s)]
*  So, how do you get over your hatred from the state to be in the arena and fight the state from within? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1811.52s)]
*  We lower the number of ministries to half. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1832.52s)]
*  We fire public employees every month. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1835.52s)]
*  We are eliminating regulations all the time. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1838.52s)]
*  We are eliminating a lot of corruption. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1843.52s)]
*  That cannot be done from the outside. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1846.52s)]
*  Clearly, you can make a lot of criticism. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1848.52s)]
*  If I were in a libertarian position, ridiculously purist, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1851.52s)]
*  nothing could change. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1857.52s)]
*  Let's say, because then I wouldn't have to be there. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1859.52s)]
*  And then I would be giving the ground to the socialists. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1863.52s)]
*  Because there is something that must be understood, that is, power is a game of zero. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1867.52s)]
*  And if we don't have it, those of us who are on the right, they're going to have it from the left. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1871.52s)]
*  And if the libertarians, instead of fighting against the left, fight against themselves, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1877.52s)]
*  the only thing they do is be functional to the left. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1883.52s)]
*  Those libertarians who do the only thing is to criticize what we do. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1886.52s)]
*  First of all, they are cowards in the vast majority, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1890.52s)]
*  because they never wanted to get into the arena, into the mud, which is politics. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1892.52s)]
*  I have had to endure all kinds of insults and insults, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1898.52s)]
*  but not only about my person, about my sister, about my father, about my mother. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1901.52s)]
*  They have said any kind of barbaric things. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1906.52s)]
*  They have gotten into it with my loved ones, with everyone. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1908.52s)]
*  They have even gotten into it with my dogs. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1911.52s)]
*  That is, they have even violated the national constitution itself, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1914.52s)]
*  which says that private actions are reserved to the private, to the conscience and to the will of God. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1917.52s)]
*  And they have been so dirty, so immoral, that they have even gotten into it with my dogs. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1924.52s)]
*  And in that sense, we must have a lot of courage to do it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1932.52s)]
*  Therefore, many of them criticize from a cowardly position. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1940.52s)]
*  Second, they ignore many of the restrictions that one faces when they are in this, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1944.52s)]
*  and not only that, but they should also have the votes that they do not have. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1949.52s)]
*  So it is easier to say that one is a libertarian and hates the State and criticize from the outside. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1955.52s)]
*  That is always much easier. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1961.52s)]
*  It even generates a set of chemical reactions in the brain that is pleasant to criticize. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1963.52s)]
*  Well, I decided to get out of criticism and fight the socialists in the face. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1970.52s)]
*  And fortunately, we are not only being very successful in Argentina, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1977.52s)]
*  but we have also expanded this supposed neighborhood phenomenon to the whole world. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1981.52s)]
*  Or, do you perhaps not know what happened after I went through Davos? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1986.52s)]
*  Or perhaps you do not know what happened after I was in Zipack, Washington? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1991.52s)]
*  Or perhaps you do not know what happened at the Milken Institute or what happened yesterday in Stanford? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=1996.52s)]
*  I love being the top within the State. I am the one who destroys the State from within. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2007.52s)]
*  It is like being infiltrated into enemy lines. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2014.52s)]
*  That is, the State reform must be done by someone who hates the State. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2019.52s)]
*  And I hate the State so much that I am willing to endure all this kind of lies, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2024.52s)]
*  slander, insults, both about my person and my most beloved beings, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2030.52s)]
*  who are my sister and my dogs and my parents, in order to destroy the State. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2035.52s)]
*  Of all of the things that are getting under your skin, why the criticism of your dogs? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2041.52s)]
*  I also pay for this with my own money. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2072.52s)]
*  For example, one of the veterinarians who comes to take care of my dogs [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2075.52s)]
*  has been called 30 times a day. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2080.52s)]
*  That garbage of journalists who are not journalists, but are political operators. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2084.52s)]
*  Do you think it is normal for a journalist to call a person 30 times [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2090.52s)]
*  a day, for a whole week, every day 30 times? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2099.52s)]
*  Don't you think it is invasive? Don't you think it is aggressive? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2104.52s)]
*  That they interfere with the aspects of my private life? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2108.52s)]
*  What does it matter to them if I do not affect anyone's life, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2112.52s)]
*  I do not affect anyone's freedom or property? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2116.52s)]
*  Why do they interfere with me? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2119.52s)]
*  Well, they do it because they are part of the political system. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2121.52s)]
*  It is not the way in which one should play. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2126.52s)]
*  Let's see, the way people have been educated is not educated in full freedom. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2156.52s)]
*  And the world that I am proposing is a freer world. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2173.52s)]
*  That is why the cultural battle is so important. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2178.52s)]
*  The cultural battle is part of showing the world that for many years it was wrong. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2183.52s)]
*  In fact, what is politically correct today is a freer world because it has a lot of socialism. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2189.52s)]
*  And when one understands the logic of the way of servitude that Hayek proposed, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2195.52s)]
*  any, and if you in the vision of Mises have the capitalism of a free company on the one hand [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2200.52s)]
*  and the real socialism on the other, any intermediate solution will show you [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2206.52s)]
*  that it is unstable in terms of capitalism, that is to say, that it will always have socialism. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2211.52s)]
*  And that is the great battle. It is a battle that will be permanent. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2216.52s)]
*  That is why it is always said that the cost of freedom is its eternal vigilance. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2221.52s)]
*  And what we have is that we increasingly have better tools to interpret this. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2228.52s)]
*  And there is something that is very important. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2233.52s)]
*  In strict rigor, the state exists because men have failed to coexist in peace. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2237.52s)]
*  And that is why the state exists. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2247.52s)]
*  You could see that very clearly in a wonderful book by Robert Nozick called [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2250.52s)]
*  Anarchy, State and Utopia, which explains how the state appears. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2257.52s)]
*  But in rigor, then the state exists because men have failed in that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2262.52s)]
*  And in reality these problems, technology could fix them. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2269.52s)]
*  So this is very important because the real world may seem more or less [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2274.52s)]
*  to the ideal of the capitalist narco as technological progress progresses. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2281.52s)]
*  In that sense, that is why I am trying to promote and exacerbate all the issues of technological [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2287.52s)]
*  nature in Argentina. Why? Because that is what will accelerate the progress of freedom. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2294.52s)]
*  I mean, not even economists are educated to understand this. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2301.52s)]
*  But that doesn't have to be a reason to lower our arms, because in fact, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2306.52s)]
*  the libertarians are more and more in the world. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2310.52s)]
*  Therefore, what we have to do is continue to fight the cultural battle, but also understand [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2313.52s)]
*  that nothing changes from the outside, much less throwing stones at ourselves. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2319.52s)]
*  So what I am doing is that I got into politics, for now it seems that it is going very well. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2324.52s)]
*  But what I do know is that I am going to die with my boots on. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2332.52s)]
*  I am not going to surrender, nor am I going to be thrown in my chair, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2336.52s)]
*  looking at how others are fighting and criticizing the ones who are favoring the socialists. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2341.52s)]
*  I don't have to get into the United States politics. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2366.52s)]
*  I have a responsibility as head of state. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2370.52s)]
*  I have decided to be a partner of the United States, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2374.52s)]
*  whether I am governed by Republicans or by the United States. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2380.52s)]
*  I have decided to be a partner of the United States, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2385.52s)]
*  whether I am governed by Republicans or by Democrats, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2390.52s)]
*  beyond my former preferences. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2397.52s)]
*  I have a responsibility as president, and I have decided that my allies in the world are the United States and Israel. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2401.52s)]
*  One of the things that is going on among the right on this country, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2407.52s)]
*  especially among younger people, sort of at the vanguard, you would say, of maybe the new right, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2411.52s)]
*  is that economically they are abandoning libertarianism and free markets, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2418.52s)]
*  and in terms of foreign policy they are embracing isolationism. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2423.52s)]
*  The exact opposite of your worldview. What is your message to those people? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2427.52s)]
*  I am talking about the project of the projimo, based on the principle of non-aggression, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2448.52s)]
*  and in defense of the right to life, freedom and property. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2452.52s)]
*  And under those rules I design the economic policy, and that is the north with which I guide myself. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2455.52s)]
*  And that is independently of what the others do. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2462.52s)]
*  There is a big debate going on right now in America about whether or not this country should still be the world's policeman. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2465.52s)]
*  Do you think the world is a safer place when America plays that role in the world? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2472.52s)]
*  The problem is that if I advance in the capitalist anarcho solution, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2495.52s)]
*  but another country does not, it can end up enslaving us, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2501.52s)]
*  because they did not embrace those ideas. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2508.52s)]
*  So you have a problem, basically, of what would be called a dilemma of the prisoners. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2511.52s)]
*  And not because of a violent intervention that does not allow them to negotiate. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2521.52s)]
*  Some countries do not advance over others because there may be a counter-reaction from the other. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2524.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, that is the world that exists. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2530.52s)]
*  That is why I am so optimistic about technology, because all these kinds of things will be able to be overcome. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2534.52s)]
*  But in the transition, unfortunately, the world is what it is. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2541.52s)]
*  And let's say, the Dreamers solutions, I propose that you take the United States out as the world's policeman. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2546.52s)]
*  I can assure you that the balance is much worse than what we have today. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2554.52s)]
*  Is this the ideal? No. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2557.52s)]
*  But in a world where there are others who play with other rules of play, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2559.52s)]
*  if you run the role of the United States, you will find a much worse world. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2565.52s)]
*  Unless you like to be a slave. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2572.52s)]
*  There's a quote that I've been going back to a lot recently, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2574.52s)]
*  as I've been rereading the writings of a lot of Soviet dissidents. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2579.52s)]
*  And perhaps you've heard this, but this is from the writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2582.52s)]
*  And here's what he says. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2587.52s)]
*  Human nature is full of riddles, he says. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2589.52s)]
*  And one of these riddles is this. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2592.52s)]
*  How is it that people who have been crushed by the sheer weight of slavery and cast to the bottom of the pit [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2594.52s)]
*  can nevertheless find strength to rise up and free themselves, first in spirit, then in body, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2602.52s)]
*  while those who soar unhampered over the peaks of freedom suddenly appear to lose the taste for freedom, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2608.52s)]
*  lose the will to defend it, and hopelessly confused and lost, almost begin to crave slavery? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2615.52s)]
*  Why is it that the people that have benefited the most from freedom, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2623.52s)]
*  the most from the Enlightenment, the most from the progress of the West, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2629.52s)]
*  take it for granted? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2634.52s)]
*  And is there a way for us, short of catastrophe, to recover the hunger that you so clearly feel for freedom? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2636.52s)]
*  The moment of leaving Egypt, only one in five left Egypt. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2689.52s)]
*  The first point is, can you achieve freedom? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2695.52s)]
*  Yes. Let's say, if you have the strength, the conviction, sooner or later you will achieve it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2699.52s)]
*  First point. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2705.52s)]
*  Second point. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2709.52s)]
*  Are there people who prefer to give up their freedom for free fishing? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2711.52s)]
*  For preferred slavery. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2717.52s)]
*  Well, but it's the choice of the people. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2719.52s)]
*  That's the second point. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2721.52s)]
*  And then there's another element. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2724.52s)]
*  Socialism is very skilled in treating the most miserable values of the human being. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2726.52s)]
*  Because socialism is based on envy, hatred, resentment, and inequality in the face of the law, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2731.52s)]
*  and if necessary, on murder, because they have murdered 150 million human beings. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2737.52s)]
*  Well, that said, when societies begin to progress, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2742.52s)]
*  what socialism does is to inoculate the virus of envy, resentment. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2748.52s)]
*  Let's say we're going to a race. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2755.52s)]
*  We're 20 people running. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2757.52s)]
*  How many people can win the race? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2760.52s)]
*  One? Just one. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2762.52s)]
*  So what does socialism do? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2764.52s)]
*  It works on the 19 remaining people, talking about a conspiracy where there's one who won and is submitting the rest, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2766.52s)]
*  and it promotes envy and hatred. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2774.52s)]
*  Because it's easier to believe it was a conspiracy than to have to accept that the other was better. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2777.52s)]
*  And that's what the cultural battle is about. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2784.52s)]
*  Showing them that their moral values are immovable, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2787.52s)]
*  and that those immovable values lead to frightening institutions, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2790.52s)]
*  and that then, when those institutions are applied, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2794.52s)]
*  countries fall apart and fall into misery. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2797.52s)]
*  Do you want a good example of this? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2800.52s)]
*  Argentina embraced the ideas of freedom in 1860. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2802.52s)]
*  From being a barbaric country, in 35 years it became the richest country in the world. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2805.52s)]
*  And then, at the beginning of the 20th century, it embraced the ideas of socialism, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2811.52s)]
*  and it became a miserable country, a country that produces food for 400 million human beings, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2816.52s)]
*  with a tax pressure in that sector of 70%. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2823.52s)]
*  That means that the State takes the food of 280 million human beings, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2826.52s)]
*  and there are 5 million Argentinians who can't afford to eat. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2830.52s)]
*  That garbage is socialism. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2833.52s)]
*  So, and how did they do it? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2835.52s)]
*  By inoculating the idea of social justice, which is based on envy, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2839.52s)]
*  which is the unequal treatment against the law, and which is based on theft. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2844.52s)]
*  And that deterioration of moral values is what generates the decline. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2848.52s)]
*  Therefore, one has to fight on the economic level, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2853.52s)]
*  one has to fight on the political level, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2856.52s)]
*  and one has to fight on the cultural level. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2859.52s)]
*  And if one fails at any of these points, socialism gets in there and triumphs. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2862.52s)]
*  That's why we fight in the political arena, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2868.52s)]
*  we give the discussion in the economy, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2871.52s)]
*  and at no time have I stopped fighting on the cultural level. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2873.52s)]
*  But maybe the lesson of the Exodus story, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2876.52s)]
*  that some people will prefer the comforts of slavery to the insecurity of freedom. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2880.52s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2884.52s)]
*  But one has to work to explain the benefits of freedom. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2885.52s)]
*  And maybe you need a Moses. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2892.52s)]
*  Yes, let's hope we can have one. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2894.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2900.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjycDtrCDuI&t=2901.52s)]
