*  And I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=6.28s)]
*  And we're the hosts of a new show at the New York Times. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=7.28s)]
*  It's called The Interview. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=10.92s)]
*  Every week, one of us is going to talk with a fascinating person in the culture, actors [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=13.16s)]
*  like Anne Hathaway. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=17.02s)]
*  I find it hard to imagine that people would be interested in me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=18.1s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why I don't know that I'm a very good celebrity. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=21.52s)]
*  Politicians like the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm as worried as I've ever been for the future of our country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=29.32s)]
*  Sometimes it takes only one really bad government in order to, I don't want to say destroy, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=33.72s)]
*  but weaken a country formed within significantly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=40.72s)]
*  Comedians like Marlon Wayans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=44.88s)]
*  It's a high that you get when you don't know if this joke that I'm about to say is going [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=47.2s)]
*  to offend everybody or they're going to walk out and you tell it and everybody cracks up [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=51.84s)]
*  and you're like, whew. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=56.64s)]
*  And the people who are shaping our national conversations like Charlemagne the God. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=58.56s)]
*  If me as a black man, if I criticize Democrats, then I'm supporting MAGA. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=63.2s)]
*  But if I criticize Donald Trump and Republicans, then I'm a Democratic shill. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=69.28s)]
*  Why can't I just be a person who deals in nuance? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=75.12s)]
*  It's The Interview from the New York Times. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgG_xLcqxY&t=80.0s)]
