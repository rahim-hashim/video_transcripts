# Antony Blinken Says the War in Gaza Wonâ€™t Define His Legacy
**New York Times - The Interview:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg)
*  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=0.0s)]
*  Four years ago, President Biden came into office with the world still wracked by the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=4.24s)]
*  coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=8.28s)]
*  And the biggest global challenge was to save lives and get economies back on their feet. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=9.96s)]
*  After the tumultuous first Trump presidency, when it came to foreign policy, the new administration [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=15.24s)]
*  wanted to rebuild old relationships and stand firmly for democracy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=25.08s)]
*  Not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=30.72s)]
*  Those challenges came fast for Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was beset by an [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=35.68s)]
*  escalating series of international crises from the Afghanistan withdrawal to Russia's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=40.2s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine, to Hamas' attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza and conflict [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=45.2s)]
*  in the wider Middle East. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=51.56s)]
*  All the while Blinken championed the promise of robust American diplomacy to solve the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=53.84s)]
*  world's many problems. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  I hope that when we look back on this period of time, one of the conclusions that people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=60.88s)]
*  will reach is that the United States was leaning in. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=65.64s)]
*  Now a new Trump administration is set to lean back from those very alliances and institutions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Blinken championed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=75.0s)]
*  Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East rage on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=76.92s)]
*  And what role America will play in the changing global order is an open question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=79.62s)]
*  On Thursday, as he enters the last few weeks of his tenure, Blinken sat down with me at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=85.22s)]
*  the State Department for a wide ranging conversation about the world he's leaving behind. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=89.62s)]
*  I think we hand over to America in a much, much stronger position. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  Which, despite it all, he argues is better than the one he inherited. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=97.54s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro, and here's my interview with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=102.14s)]
*  Secretary Blinken, four years ago, you inherited the world from President Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=109.62s)]
*  And now you're about to hand it back to him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  Your tenure has been an unprecedented interregnum, if you will. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=125.98s)]
*  Have you thought about what a strange position that is to be in? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=132.16s)]
*  Well, I think a lot about the two sides of this coin that you just alluded to, what we [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=135.98s)]
*  inherited and what we're handing off. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  In terms of what we inherited, it's so easy to lose sight because people are focused understandably [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=143.22s)]
*  on the present and on the future, not on the past. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=147.52s)]
*  But if you just look back four years, when we took office, we inherited arguably the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=150.26s)]
*  worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=156.34s)]
*  We inherited the worst public health crisis in at least 100 years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=159.7s)]
*  We had a country that was divided, and we had fraught relationships with allies and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=165.18s)]
*  partners around the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=172.02s)]
*  And a perception from our adversaries, whether it was Russia, whether it was China, other [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=173.86s)]
*  countries, that the United States was in inexorable decline. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=180.22s)]
*  Today, as I sit with you, and as we look at all of the terrain we've traveled these last [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=184.46s)]
*  four years, I think we hand over to America in a much, much stronger position, having [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=189.96s)]
*  come through the economic crisis, having come through the health crisis, and having changed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=195.36s)]
*  much for the better our position around the world because we've made those investments [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  in alliances and partnerships. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=204.52s)]
*  And thinking back to when you first came into office, you know, President Biden painted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  a portrait of a world that was seeing a sort of battle between democracy and autocracy, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=211.96s)]
*  a phrase that was repeatedly used. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=218.32s)]
*  Yet at home, voters have been skeptical of that fight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=220.56s)]
*  Many voters bought into President-elect Trump's vision of an America that should be less [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=225.16s)]
*  involved in the world. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=231.88s)]
*  Why don't you think that the Biden administration and you in particular were able to convince [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=233.32s)]
*  voters of the benefit of what you have been endeavoring to do these past few years? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure that I agree with the premise of the question, which is from what I see, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=244.28s)]
*  from what I read, from the analysis that I see, most Americans want us to be engaged [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=249.84s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  They want to make sure that we stay out of wars, that we avoid conflict, which is exactly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  what we've done. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=259.56s)]
*  But they want to see the United States engaged. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think they understand that if we're not engaged, if we're not leading, then one [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=261.64s)]
*  of two things is likely. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=267.28s)]
*  Someone else will do it in our place and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  our values. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=273.32s)]
*  Maybe it's China, maybe it's some other country or maybe just as bad. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=274.36s)]
*  No one does it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=279.2s)]
*  And then you're likely to have a vacuum that's filled by bad things before it's filled with [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=280.48s)]
*  good things. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=283.68s)]
*  And inevitably, that comes back to bite us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  And from what I see, most Americans understand that, believe that and want to see us leading [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=288.28s)]
*  and engaged. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=294.64s)]
*  So you don't believe that the election was a repudiation of the vision of President Biden [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=295.28s)]
*  and your vision in particular, because, you know, obviously, President-elect Trump has a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=300.36s)]
*  very different idea of how to engage in the world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=304.64s)]
*  First, one of the things in this job that I've appreciated about it is I don't do politics, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=309.12s)]
*  I do policy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  So the real question is, what are the policies that can make a difference in the lives of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=314.44s)]
*  Americans, can make them a little bit safer, a little bit more full of opportunity, a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  little bit healthier? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what we're really focused on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=324.0s)]
*  How do these these policies that we're pursuing around the world translate into real [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=325.32s)]
*  benefits for the American people? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=329.64s)]
*  In terms of analysis, the election, really not my place to do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=331.36s)]
*  And there are lots of different views on why the election came out. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=334.68s)]
*  I'm not asking you to do politics. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=338.32s)]
*  I'm just asking for a little reflection on this is something you've given your life to. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=339.76s)]
*  Obviously, the results were a disappointment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  And so I wonder if that doesn't seek you to pause and reflect that perhaps that animating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  vision that you have had might not have been what Americans wanted. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=357.08s)]
*  I mean, do you think there's just a changing sense in this country of our place in the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  world and what we owe our allies? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=367.68s)]
*  So, again, I'm not at all sure that the election turned on any one or even collection of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=370.2s)]
*  foreign policy issues. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=377.24s)]
*  Most elections don't. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=378.2s)]
*  But leaving that aside, Americans don't want us in conflict. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  They don't want us in war. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  We went through 20 years where we had hundreds of thousands of Americans deployed to Iraq [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=384.6s)]
*  and Afghanistan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=389.2s)]
*  People were tired of that, understandably. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=390.44s)]
*  Well, when President Biden was vice president, he presided over the end of our engagement [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=392.84s)]
*  in Iraq in terms of the war there and ending ending that part of the conflict as president. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=399.52s)]
*  He ended the longest war in our history. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=404.64s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=407.32s)]
*  The investments that we've made in in our NATO alliance, maybe we haven't done a good [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=409.76s)]
*  enough job explaining it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=413.44s)]
*  And that's that's the case. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=414.32s)]
*  That's that's on me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=415.76s)]
*  But one of the things that we try to explain to Americans who, given that this is a generation, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=417.0s)]
*  of course, that is far removed from World War Two, never mind World War One, the reason [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=422.88s)]
*  so many of the institutions, including NATO, came into being in the first place was to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=429.88s)]
*  try to make sure that we never had another global conflagration after World War Two. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=434.56s)]
*  And the strength of an alliance like NATO is in the basic bargain the countries make [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=439.12s)]
*  in joining it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=444.44s)]
*  And that is an attack on one is an attack on all. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=445.0s)]
*  That is the single most powerful way to prevent conflict in the first place, to deter [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=447.92s)]
*  aggression. I think when we can put it in those terms and Americans can see that we're [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=452.44s)]
*  making investments in something like the NATO alliance precisely because we want to avoid [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=456.68s)]
*  conflict, we want to prevent war, we want to deter aggression. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=460.52s)]
*  That's something that they sign on to, that they buy into. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=463.68s)]
*  I want to pick up on something that you said there, which is discussing Afghanistan, because [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=466.84s)]
*  this takes us back, I think, to the beginning of your tenure. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=473.36s)]
*  You know, I think it is reasonable to argue that American skepticism of the Biden [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=476.16s)]
*  administration's handling on foreign policy really began with the catastrophic way we [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=482.08s)]
*  got out of Afghanistan. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=486.8s)]
*  There was consensus that we should absolutely end that war. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  But the manner in which it was done was very detrimental. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, when President Biden first took office, there was this promise that you and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=496.92s)]
*  everyone else that was being brought on board were the adults in the room that were going [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=501.76s)]
*  to be ending the chaos of the Trump administration. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  How did that early failure in Afghanistan really change the sense? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=508.56s)]
*  Do you think that President Biden really had this under control, that you had it under [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=513.76s)]
*  control? Did it damage America's credibility? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=520.88s)]
*  First, I make no apologies for ending America's longest war. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=524.12s)]
*  This, I think, is a signal achievement of the president's. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=528.16s)]
*  The fact that we will not have another generation of Americans fighting and dying in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=532.88s)]
*  Afghanistan, I think that's an important achievement in and of itself. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=536.72s)]
*  It's also actually strengthened our position around the world. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=540.96s)]
*  And I see that every single day. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=543.2s)]
*  Our adversaries would have liked nothing more than for us to have remained bogged down [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=544.96s)]
*  in Afghanistan and for another decade would have been good by them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  But you've left a country that is in control of the Taliban, where the stated dream of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  spreading democracy has been completely upended. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  Women have won the brunt of that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, there's restrictions on their movements, restrictions on even their voices, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  what jobs they can take. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in every possible way, the manner in which this was done and the state in which [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan has been left could not have been what the United States desired. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  There was never going to be an easy way to extricate ourselves from 20 years of war. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  I think the question was, what were we going to do moving forward from the withdrawal? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=591.2s)]
*  We also had to learn lessons from Afghanistan itself. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=596.32s)]
*  Here at the State Department, one of the things that I ordered almost immediately was an [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=599.0s)]
*  after action review to try to make sure that we understood what have we gotten right. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=603.84s)]
*  Also, what have we gotten wrong in the withdrawal itself? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=607.72s)]
*  I brought back senior diplomats to do that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=611.64s)]
*  We produced a lengthy report with about 40 recommendations. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  We followed through on most of them to make sure that we're in a better position to deal [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=618.28s)]
*  with a crisis, to deal with an evacuation like Afghanistan. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  And we are. And in fact, we've actually put into practice many of those [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=625.2s)]
*  recommendations in subsequent crises that we had to face, whether it was in Lebanon, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=628.4s)]
*  whether it was in Israel, whether it was in Sudan, all of that we brought to bear based [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=633.64s)]
*  on lessons that we've learned from Afghanistan. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=638.64s)]
*  Six months after Afghanistan, Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=641.52s)]
*  That was February of 2022. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=644.36s)]
*  I mean, I remember that moment of being as being terrifying. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=646.24s)]
*  How close were we to direct conflict? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=648.92s)]
*  Look, there have been different moments where we had real concerns about actions that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=651.64s)]
*  Russia might take, including even potentially the use of nuclear weapons that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  very much focused the mind. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  But again, I think throughout we've been able to navigate this in a way that has kept [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=662.28s)]
*  us away from direct conflict with Russia. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=669.24s)]
*  Now, Russia is engaged in all sorts of nefarious activities, so-called hybrid attacks of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=671.16s)]
*  one kind or another, whether it's in cyberspace, whether it's acts of sabotage, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=676.56s)]
*  assassination. Those things are happening. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=683.08s)]
*  They're happening in Europe. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=685.24s)]
*  And this is something that we're working very closely on with many of our partners. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=686.64s)]
*  But in terms of direct conflict, I don't think we've been close, but it's something [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=690.64s)]
*  that we've had to be very, very mindful of. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=696.88s)]
*  You made two early strategic decisions on Ukraine. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=699.2s)]
*  The first, because of that fear of direct conflict, was to restrict Ukraine's use of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=702.44s)]
*  American weapons within Russia. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=707.36s)]
*  The second was to support Ukraine's military offensive without a parallel diplomatic [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=709.76s)]
*  track to try and end the conflict. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  How do you look back on those decisions now? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=717.64s)]
*  So first, if you look at the trajectory of the conflict, because we saw it coming, we [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  were able to make sure that not only were we prepared and allies and partners were [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=728.6s)]
*  prepared, but that Ukraine was prepared. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=731.36s)]
*  We made sure that well before the Russian aggression happened, starting in September, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=733.84s)]
*  the Russian aggression happened in February, starting in September, and then again in [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=739.16s)]
*  December, we quietly got a lot of weapons to Ukraine to make sure that they had in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=742.4s)]
*  hand what they needed to defend themselves. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=747.12s)]
*  Things like stingers, javelins that they could use that were instrumental in preventing [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=748.56s)]
*  Russia from taking Kiev, from rolling over the country, erasing it from the map, and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=754.12s)]
*  indeed pushing the Russians back. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=758.76s)]
*  But I think what's so important to understand is at different points in time, people get [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=761.4s)]
*  focused on one weapon system or another. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=767.0s)]
*  Is it an Abrams tank? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=769.2s)]
*  Is it an F-16? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=770.16s)]
*  Is it an Atacom missile? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=771.28s)]
*  What we've had to look at each and every time is not only should we give this particular [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=774.68s)]
*  system to the Ukrainians, but do they know how to use it? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=779.72s)]
*  Do they have the requisite training? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=782.88s)]
*  Can they maintain it? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=784.36s)]
*  Is it part of a coherent plan? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=785.72s)]
*  All of those things factored into the decisions we made on what to give them and when to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=788.0s)]
*  give it. But in each and every time, it was to make sure that they had what they needed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=792.76s)]
*  to defend themselves. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  In terms of diplomacy, look, we've exerted extraordinary diplomacy in bringing and keeping [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=797.12s)]
*  together more than 50 countries, not only in Europe, but well beyond, in support of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine and in defense of these principles that Russia also attacked back in February [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=807.6s)]
*  of that year. Look, I worked very hard in the lead up to the war, including meetings [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  with my Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva a couple of months before the war, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=818.64s)]
*  trying to find a way to see if we could prevent it, trying to test the proposition, whether [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=825.64s)]
*  this was really about Russia's concerns for its security, concerns somehow about Ukraine [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=830.92s)]
*  and the threat it posed or NATO and the threat that it posed, or whether this was about [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=837.0s)]
*  what it in fact is about, which is Putin's imperial ambitions and the desire to recreate [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=842.4799999999999s)]
*  a greater Russia, to subsume Ukraine back into Russia. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=847.8s)]
*  But we had to test that proposition. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  And we were intensely engaged diplomatically with Russia. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=852.12s)]
*  Since then, since then, had there been any opportunity to engage diplomatically in a [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=855.12s)]
*  way that could end the war on just and durable terms, we would have been the first to seize [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=861.0799999999999s)]
*  them. Unfortunately, at least till this moment, we haven't seen any signs that Russia has [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=864.92s)]
*  been genuinely prepared to engage. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=870.24s)]
*  I hope that that changes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  However, Ukraine has been left in this position now where a new administration is coming [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=874.68s)]
*  in, have a very different view of the conflict. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=880.72s)]
*  And one could argue that Ukraine is not in a terribly strong position to be able to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=884.08s)]
*  navigate what comes next. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=891.0s)]
*  We know that President-elect Trump has members of people that surround him that are very [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=892.96s)]
*  willing to see Ukraine cede territory to Russia. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=899.88s)]
*  There has been no parallel diplomatic track and the weapons are probably going to be [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  drying up. So, I mean, do you feel like you've left Ukraine in the strongest position [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=907.6s)]
*  that you could have? Or what are the things that you could have done differently? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=914.48s)]
*  Well, first, what we've left is Ukraine, which was not not self-evident because Putin's [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=917.44s)]
*  ambition was to erase it from the map. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=924.88s)]
*  We stopped that. Putin has failed. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=927.0s)]
*  His strategic objective in regaining Ukraine has failed and will not succeed. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=929.0s)]
*  Ukraine is standing and I believe it also has extraordinary potential not only to survive, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=935.84s)]
*  but actually to thrive going forward. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=942.96s)]
*  And that does depend on decisions that future administrations and many other countries will [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=944.2800000000001s)]
*  make. Right now, as I'm looking at this, I think the real measure of success is whether [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=948.4s)]
*  going forward Ukraine will continue to stand strong as an independent country, increasingly [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=958.72s)]
*  integrated with Western institutions and able to stand on its own feet militarily, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=964.68s)]
*  economically, democratically. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=970.8s)]
*  And in each of those areas, we put Ukraine on a trajectory to do that. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's time to end the war, though? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=975.9599999999999s)]
*  These are decisions for Ukrainians to make. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=978.0799999999999s)]
*  They have to decide where their future is and how they want to get there. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=980.5999999999999s)]
*  Where the line is drawn on the map at this point, I don't think is fundamentally going to [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=985.12s)]
*  change very much. The real question is, can we make sure that Ukraine is in a position to move [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=989.68s)]
*  forward strongly? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=994.24s)]
*  That the areas that Russia controls, you feel, will have to be ceded? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=994.88s)]
*  Ceded is not the question. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1000.12s)]
*  The question is, the line as a practical matter in the foreseeable future is unlikely to move [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1002.4s)]
*  very much. Ukraine's claim on that territory will always be there. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1009.52s)]
*  And the question is, will they find ways with the support of others to re-grant territory [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1015.48s)]
*  that's been lost? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1020.72s)]
*  I think the critical thing now going forward is this. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1021.56s)]
*  If there is going to be a resolution or at least a near term resolution, because it's unlikely [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1024.0s)]
*  that Putin will give up on his ambitions. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  If there's a ceasefire, then in Putin's mind, the ceasefire is likely to give him time to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1033.24s)]
*  rest, to refit, to re-attack at some point in the future. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1038.6s)]
*  So what's going to be critical to make sure that any ceasefire that comes about is actually [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1041.76s)]
*  enduring is to make sure that Ukraine has the capacity going forward to deter further [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1045.56s)]
*  aggression. And that can come in many forms. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  It could come through NATO. And we put Ukraine on a path to NATO membership. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1054.32s)]
*  It could come through security assurances, commitments, guarantees by different countries to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1058.6s)]
*  make sure that Russia knows that if it re-attacks, it's going to have a big problem. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1063.32s)]
*  That, I think, is going to be critical to making sure that any deal that's negotiated [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  actually endures and then allows Ukraine the space, the time to grow strong as a country. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1071.24s)]
*  It's interesting. What I'm hearing you say is that Ukraine's fate will no longer rest in its [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1076.44s)]
*  major supporter, the United States. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1081.24s)]
*  You see it as resting elsewhere, Europe, et cetera. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  Look, I hope very much and I don't want to say expect, but I certainly hope very much that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1087.5600000000002s)]
*  the United States will remain the vital supporter that it's been for Ukraine, because again, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1094.68s)]
*  this is not just about Ukraine. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1099.24s)]
*  It's never just been about Ukraine. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1101.96s)]
*  Well, let me pick up on something that you said and the idea of this interregnum that you [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1103.88s)]
*  have had of picking up from Trump and handing back to Trump, because this is one of the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1110.52s)]
*  conflicts that will be handed back to Trump. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1114.24s)]
*  And his approach to foreign policy writ large seems to be to avoid engaging militarily [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1116.44s)]
*  while wanting the world to be scared of us. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1123.4s)]
*  He doesn't seem terribly interested in the work of diplomacy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1126.76s)]
*  I'm curious both how you would define that foreign policy philosophy and what you think [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1132.08s)]
*  of that approach. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  To me, as I said before, in the absence of American diplomacy, you're going to have [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1141.2s)]
*  diplomacy by lots of other countries that are going to shape the world in ways that may [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1144.64s)]
*  not be so friendly to our own interests and our own values. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1148.4s)]
*  So that's a choice. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1152.76s)]
*  We can disengage. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1154.36s)]
*  We cannot be present. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1156.12s)]
*  We can stand back. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1157.6s)]
*  But we know others will step in and we have to decide whether that's in our interest. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1158.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's not that he wants to stand back. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1162.76s)]
*  It's that he uses other methods to make countries bend to America's will. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1165.48s)]
*  You're seeing some of these actions. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1173.0s)]
*  Let's take an example. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1175.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's take a concrete example. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's let's talk about China for a minute. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1177.52s)]
*  I think President Trump was right during his first administration in identifying some of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1180.04s)]
*  the challenges posed by China. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1184.68s)]
*  No country has the capacity that China does to reshape to its own will and designs the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1186.32s)]
*  international system that we and many others put in place after the Second World War. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  It has the military power, the economic power, the diplomatic power to do that in ways that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1198.68s)]
*  no other country does. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1203.8s)]
*  And we also know that many of the practices it's engaged in have been grossly unfair to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1205.8000000000002s)]
*  our workers, to our companies, undercutting them, driving them out of business. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1211.04s)]
*  So I think he was right in identifying that problem, where I would disagree with the approach [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1215.5600000000002s)]
*  he took and where I would commend to him the approach that we pursued is we're so much [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  more effective in dealing with the challenges posed by China when we're working closely [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1224.72s)]
*  with other countries. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1228.72s)]
*  So if you're trying to take on the China problem, but at the same time, you're taking actions [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1230.2s)]
*  that in one way or another alienate allies and partners, you're likely to be less effective [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1236.08s)]
*  in dealing with China. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1240.96s)]
*  When we took office, the European Union was on the verge of signing a major trade agreement [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1242.24s)]
*  with China. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1246.84s)]
*  They were hedging. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1247.84s)]
*  They weren't sure if they could count on the United States. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  We'd had real challenges in the relationships in the preceding four years, and they were [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  hedging toward China. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1259.36s)]
*  So were many other countries. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1260.1599999999999s)]
*  We were really on the decline when it came dealing with China diplomatically and economically. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  We've reversed that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1268.56s)]
*  And so I think the difference is the way we've approached it is we've sought to bring other [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  countries in to dealing with this challenge. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1273.3999999999999s)]
*  When we're dealing with China's economic practices that we don't like and we're doing it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1275.8s)]
*  alone, we're 20 percent of world GDP. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1278.76s)]
*  When we aligned Europeans, key allies and partners in the Asia Pacific, we're suddenly [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1281.24s)]
*  40, 50, 60 percent of world GDP, something that China can't ignore. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1286.12s)]
*  And again and again, what I've seen over these last four years is a convergence in the approach [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  taken to China with Europe and with Asia that we've not seen before. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1295.9599999999998s)]
*  And I know it's succeeding because every time I meet with my Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1300.9199999999998s)]
*  the foreign minister, he inevitably spends 30, 40 minutes, 60 minutes complaining about [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1305.7199999999998s)]
*  everything we've done to align other countries to build this convergence in dealing with [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1311.68s)]
*  things that we don't like that China's pursuing. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1317.8s)]
*  So to me, that is the proof point that we're much better off through diplomacy. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1319.48s)]
*  So do you think then that President-elect Trump's plan to place heavy tariffs on Chinese [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1325.64s)]
*  goods, up to possibly 60 percent blanket tariffs, also to place tariffs on our allies, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1335.92s)]
*  Canada and other countries, is that misguided? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1343.44s)]
*  Look, tariffs have their place. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1347.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, the Biden administration had their own. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1349.2800000000002s)]
*  And I think when they're strategically focused, then they can be a very effective and important tool. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1351.4s)]
*  Look, the jury's out on exactly what the incoming administration does. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1356.64s)]
*  We'll see. All I'm saying is I think there is a strategic utility, but they should be [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1361.4s)]
*  not in my judgment, at least when you do them across the board, then the people who usually pay [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1365.52s)]
*  the price are consumers because it's a tax that gets passed along to them because the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1370.96s)]
*  producers of whatever the product is have to raise their prices because it's suddenly a lot more [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1376.56s)]
*  expensive to do business. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1381.04s)]
*  Just one last question on China. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1382.2s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I have been curious about is how the world sees the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1384.32s)]
*  whiplash of our foreign policy just changing from one administration to the other so [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1393.6399999999999s)]
*  dramatically. You know, how do you think China, for example, sees our increasingly [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1401.04s)]
*  inconsistent foreign policy during the last decade that has seemed to just go from one [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1407.96s)]
*  extreme to the other? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1414.88s)]
*  Are they exploiting it or are they concerned about it? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1416.48s)]
*  Look, I think if you're if you're sitting in Beijing and I sat across the table from [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1420.3600000000001s)]
*  President Xi Jinping on several occasions in Beijing, as close as we are now, and I think [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1424.48s)]
*  what he sees is something that he didn't see four years ago. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1432.08s)]
*  Four years ago, when he looked at the United States, he saw a country that he thought was [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1437.6s)]
*  in an extradable decline and China in an extradable ascendancy. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1442.52s)]
*  I think that picture looks very, very different today. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1448.2s)]
*  And I also think that what he's seeing is the United States that recognizes Republicans, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1451.0s)]
*  Democrats, everything in between. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1456.72s)]
*  The China poses a profound challenge to us, and it's going to be an enduring challenge. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1459.76s)]
*  We're in a competition to shape what the future looks like. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1463.2s)]
*  And that competition doesn't have a clear finish line. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not like ending a war. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1470.0s)]
*  It's going to be there for a long time. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1472.96s)]
*  And the question is, have we set ourselves up in the best possible way to approach that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1475.0s)]
*  competition from a position of strength? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1480.76s)]
*  And I believe that's exactly what we've done. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1482.24s)]
*  I do want to turn to what has become the defining crisis of this era, which is the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1483.76s)]
*  conflict in Gaza. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1488.0s)]
*  You came in thinking you could broker a historic agreement between Saudi Arabia and [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1490.28s)]
*  Israel, and then Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th with the horrific results which [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1495.16s)]
*  we saw. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1499.68s)]
*  And Israel's response has been extreme. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1501.56s)]
*  The latest U.N. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1504.64s)]
*  figures put the Palestinian death toll at 45,000. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1505.36s)]
*  Over 90 percent of Gaza's population is now displaced. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1507.96s)]
*  The population is starving. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1511.44s)]
*  All hospitals have been destroyed. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1513.44s)]
*  In November, a U.N. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1515.84s)]
*  committee released a report that found Israel's warfare practices, quote, consistent [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1516.96s)]
*  with the characteristics of genocide. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1521.0s)]
*  I know you don't agree with that estimation, but do you believe that Israel's actions [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1523.84s)]
*  have been consistent with the rules of war? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1528.76s)]
*  Let's step back for a second and think about where we were on October 6th and then where [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1534.12s)]
*  we were on October 7th and where we've been since then. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1539.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1542.88s)]
*  On October 6th, we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1543.3200000000002s)]
*  And in fact, I was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10th. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1548.8000000000002s)]
*  A trip, obviously, that didn't happen because of the events of October 7th. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1553.52s)]
*  But the purpose of that trip was to work on the Palestinian component of any normalization [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1556.8400000000001s)]
*  agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, because we believed, and the Saudis also said [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1563.68s)]
*  it was usually important to make sure that if there was going to be normalization, there [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1568.72s)]
*  was also a pathway toward a Palestinian state. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  That's exactly what I was going to the region to work on. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1576.88s)]
*  Well, as I said, that trip didn't happen since October 7th. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1578.88s)]
*  We've had some core goals in mind. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1582.1200000000001s)]
*  I was there. I was in Israel and then in the region five days later. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  I saw horrors beyond anyone's imagination, inflicted on men, women and children. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1591.24s)]
*  And we were determined to do everything we could to help ensure that October 7th would [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1599.4s)]
*  never happen again. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1605.04s)]
*  We also wanted to make sure that the war wouldn't spread, that conflict wouldn't wouldn't [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1606.1200000000001s)]
*  spread to other fronts, to other countries, because that would mean more death and destruction. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1611.0s)]
*  It would also mean that the actions Israel was taking in Gaza were likely to endure even [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1615.16s)]
*  longer. And I can come to that in a minute. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1619.96s)]
*  Third, we wanted to make sure to the best of our ability that the children, the women, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1622.4s)]
*  the men in Gaza who were caught in a crossfire of Hamas's initiation, that they did [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1630.64s)]
*  nothing to start and were basically powerless to stop, were as protected as possible and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1637.76s)]
*  got the assistance they needed to survive this horrific conflict. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1643.52s)]
*  And we've been working on each of those fronts every day since. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1648.16s)]
*  When it comes to making sure that October 7th can't happen again, I think we're in a [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1653.24s)]
*  good place. Israel has destroyed Hamas's military capabilities. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1659.32s)]
*  It's eliminated the leadership that was responsible for October 7th. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1663.8s)]
*  And that in and of itself should be reason to find an off ramp in Gaza. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1667.56s)]
*  While destroying the territory. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1672.84s)]
*  I mean, there's huge suffering. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1674.8s)]
*  I don't need to tell you that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  No one needs to remind me of the suffering because it's something that drives me every [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  single day. It's exactly why we've done everything in our power to find a way to get an end [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1684.6s)]
*  to the conflict through getting the hostages back and getting a ceasefire. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1690.32s)]
*  I've been to the region a dozen times with that in mind. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1693.52s)]
*  I mean, even Israel's former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Elon referred to what's [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1698.48s)]
*  happening in Gaza as war crimes and ethnic cleansing. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1703.48s)]
*  I mean, this is internal criticism. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1706.6s)]
*  This is not external. So I guess I would repeat the question and ask you, has Israel [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1709.84s)]
*  respected the rules of war in Gaza? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  We, as you know, have looked and continue to look at that in depth. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1717.72s)]
*  And we put out we put out our own reports on this with our own assessments. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1722.16s)]
*  And when it comes to the actions that Israel has taken in its defense, in its just [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1726.8799999999999s)]
*  defense, in trying to make sure that October 7th never happens again, we've said from day [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1734.08s)]
*  one that how Israel does that matters. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1738.32s)]
*  And throughout starting on day one, we tried to ensure that people had what they needed [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  to get by. The very first trip that I made to Israel five days after October 7th, I [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1747.84s)]
*  spent with my team nine hours in the Curia, the IDF's headquarters in Tel Aviv, six [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1753.88s)]
*  stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1762.3600000000001s)]
*  arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1767.2800000000002s)]
*  needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1773.48s)]
*  And that that was an argument that took place because you had in Israel in the days after [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1776.44s)]
*  October 7th, a totally traumatized society and public opinion. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1785.0800000000002s)]
*  This wasn't just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1788.88s)]
*  This was an entire society that didn't want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1792.68s)]
*  in Gaza. I argued that for nine hours. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1796.3200000000002s)]
*  President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1799.5600000000002s)]
*  And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I'm going to call the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1806.4s)]
*  president and tell him not to come if you don't allow this assistance to start flowing. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1809.92s)]
*  And I called the president and to make sure that he agreed with that and he fully did. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1814.72s)]
*  Anyway, we got the agreement to begin assistance through through Rafa, which we expanded to [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  Krem Shalom to many other places. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1826.6000000000001s)]
*  I say this by way of saying that we've tried all along to look out for the needs of so [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  many people who've been caught in this horrific crossfire. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1837.8000000000002s)]
*  And we have a traumatized Palestinian population for obvious reasons. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1841.44s)]
*  I've met with Palestinian Americans who've lost loved ones in Gaza. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1844.76s)]
*  I have with me still a little brochure that one fellow American made that has pictures [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1849.92s)]
*  of his family in Gaza on one side, the left side, those who were killed, including [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1860.36s)]
*  children, and on the right side, those who are still alive. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1868.52s)]
*  And that motivates me as well every single day to try to find a better way forward. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1871.76s)]
*  Now, Israel is operating in a unique environment, which doesn't absolve it of its [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1876.84s)]
*  responsibilities, but we met those responsibilities. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1884.24s)]
*  And when it comes, for example, to the provision of humanitarian assistance, we've [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  found periods of time where no, we didn't think they were doing enough. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1892.6799999999998s)]
*  And this is exactly why most recently with with Secretary Austin, we pressed them very [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  hard to to take actions that would ensure that more assistance got to people. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1902.56s)]
*  Because, as you know, withholding food aid is considered a war crime. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1906.48s)]
*  And so what you're saying to me is that actually they didn't want to even provide food. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1912.16s)]
*  No, there's a difference between there's a big difference between intent and result, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1917.48s)]
*  whether it's under the law or under anyone's standard. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1921.3600000000001s)]
*  The results that we were seeing were grossly insufficient. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1925.92s)]
*  That is the results in getting people the assistance they needed, just as making sure [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1929.04s)]
*  that people are protected, I think, has been insufficient. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1933.16s)]
*  There's a very different question about what was the intent. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, what we've seen in Gaza is fairly indiscriminate. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1940.72s)]
*  We have seen reporting of absolute devastation, entire areas flattened. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1947.0400000000002s)]
*  And at the crux of this, of course, is the fact that the United States provides so many [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  of these weapons to Israel, the two thousand pound bombs that have killed Palestinian [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1962.84s)]
*  civilians. They get vetted through the State Department. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  And I know that the administration has been struggling with this the whole way through. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1976.6799999999998s)]
*  But where we are now is that the war is still being prosecuted. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1981.04s)]
*  Hamas is no longer deemed a threat in the way that it was. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1986.52s)]
*  And the population has been completely decimated. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  So I'm curious why still provide these weapons to Israel. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=1995.72s)]
*  As I said from from day one, first of all, we have been and we remain fundamentally [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2001.2s)]
*  committed to Israel's defense. And unfortunately, it faces adversaries and enemies from all [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2008.2s)]
*  directions. And that means that the support that the United States provides over many [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2013.92s)]
*  administrations, Republican and Democrat, over many years, that support is absolutely [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2019.2s)]
*  vital to making sure that Israel is able to defend itself, that it can deter aggression [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2024.72s)]
*  coming from many other quarters, whether it's Hezbollah, whether it's Iran, whether it's [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2028.04s)]
*  the many Iranian backed proxies, whether it's the Houthis, you name it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2031.72s)]
*  That support is vital to making sure Israel has a deterrent, has an adequate defense. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2036.1200000000001s)]
*  And in turn, that means that we're not going to have an even broader, wider conflict that [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2040.44s)]
*  results in more death and more destruction. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2045.52s)]
*  And so it's been vital to maintain that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2047.76s)]
*  Second, we believe and continue to believe that the quickest way, the most effective [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2049.68s)]
*  way to have an enduring end to Gaza is through an agreement on ceasefire that brings the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2053.92s)]
*  hostages home. The two biggest impediments to getting that over the finish line. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2059.72s)]
*  And we've been so close on several occasions. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2064.0s)]
*  And as we speak today, we're also very close. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2066.64s)]
*  There have been two major impediments and they both go to what drives Hamas. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2069.68s)]
*  One has been whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2074.08s)]
*  Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we've seen it. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2079.84s)]
*  Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2084.88s)]
*  And so there are times when what we say in private to Israel, where we have a disagreement, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2090.6s)]
*  is one thing and what we're doing or saying in public may be another. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2096.92s)]
*  But that's in no small measure, because with this daylight, the prospects of getting the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2104.04s)]
*  hostages and ceasefire deal over the finish line become more distant. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2110.76s)]
*  Well, there were moments when it seemed you were trying to draw red lines in public, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2114.64s)]
*  telling Israel not to go into Rafa, for example. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  And then they did. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2121.16s)]
*  Israel's prime minister. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2122.56s)]
*  They went into Rafa in a very different way than they were planning to do. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2123.36s)]
*  They never seem to listen to you, though. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2126.2s)]
*  No, I disagree with that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2127.8799999999997s)]
*  And again, I mentioned how we've gone at humanitarian assistance from day one. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2128.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's been a preneal and ongoing effort throughout this time. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  When it comes to Rafa, we had deep, deep concerns about a direct attack and the use of [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2142.52s)]
*  the 2000 pound munitions in densely populated areas. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2146.8399999999997s)]
*  What Israel wound up doing in Rafa was very different from what they were planning to [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2149.72s)]
*  do before we engaged with them. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2152.96s)]
*  So you feel like you've been effective in shaping the conduct of Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2156.3199999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2163.68s)]
*  I think the question we had was how can we most effectively both shape the conflict, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2163.96s)]
*  but also bring an end to the conflict? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2168.8799999999997s)]
*  And the focus on getting a ceasefire hostage agreement was what was, in our estimation, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2171.8399999999997s)]
*  the quickest and most durable way to get an end. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2176.2s)]
*  And as I said, Hamas won. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2179.04s)]
*  When they saw Israel under pressure publicly, they pulled back. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2181.12s)]
*  The other thing that got Hamas to pull back was their belief, their hope that there'd [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2183.52s)]
*  be a wider conflict, that Hezbollah would attack Israel, that Iran would attack Israel, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2189.36s)]
*  that other actors would attack Israel, and that Israel would have its hands full and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2194.72s)]
*  Hamas could continue what it was doing. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2199.8s)]
*  So we've worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2201.96s)]
*  Part of that was making sure that Israel had what it needed to defend itself to deter [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2204.8s)]
*  broader aggression. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2208.52s)]
*  The second part of that was when we were on the precipice on multiple occasions of having [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2209.92s)]
*  the wider war that Hamas wanted, we found ways through diplomacy and through defense [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2214.6800000000003s)]
*  and deterrence to avert it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2218.64s)]
*  Did you have a partner in Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2219.8s)]
*  Because it was reported that he blocked a ceasefire deal in July that would have led [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2222.08s)]
*  to the hostages being released. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2226.08s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2227.56s)]
*  No, that's not accurate. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2228.04s)]
*  What we've seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2229.88s)]
*  concluded. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2235.48s)]
*  There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2235.88s)]
*  but there's been a rationale for those actions, even if they've sometimes made getting [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2241.12s)]
*  to a conclusion more difficult. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2246.0s)]
*  For example, the killing of Sinwar. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2247.1600000000003s)]
*  In the absence of Sinwar, where you had basically a single decider, that happened just [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2250.2000000000003s)]
*  at a point where we thought we might be able to bring this agreement over the finish [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2256.76s)]
*  line. All of a sudden, there's not a single decider and it's a lot harder to get a [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2259.48s)]
*  decision out of Hamas. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2263.32s)]
*  So all of these actions have second and third order effects that you have to calculate. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2265.7200000000003s)]
*  But fundamentally, look, one of the things that I found a little astounding throughout [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2271.4s)]
*  is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2277.88s)]
*  Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7th about Hamas. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2285.84s)]
*  Why there hasn't been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2292.84s)]
*  weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2298.36s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is to that. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2301.92s)]
*  Israel, on various occasions, has offered safe passage to Hamas's leadership and fighters [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2303.28s)]
*  out of Gaza. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2308.32s)]
*  Where is the world? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2309.68s)]
*  Where is the world in saying, yeah, do that, end this, stop the suffering of people that [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2310.68s)]
*  you've brought on? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2315.32s)]
*  Now, again, that doesn't absolve Israel of the way of its actions in conducting the [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2316.52s)]
*  war. But I do have to question how it is we haven't seen a greater sustained condemnation [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2321.24s)]
*  and pressure on Hamas to stop what it started and to end the suffering of people that it [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2328.4799999999996s)]
*  initiated. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2333.2799999999997s)]
*  I do want to ask you about your own standing in the department that you lead because you've [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2333.9599999999996s)]
*  had a series of very public defections over the conduct at the State Department over Gaza. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2338.3199999999997s)]
*  The latest to speak out is Mike Casey, who was the State Department's deputy political [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2345.6s)]
*  counselor on Gaza and resigned in July. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2349.24s)]
*  He recently talked to The Guardian about his tenure and he claimed that the State Department [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2351.72s)]
*  frequently rolled over for Israel, that no one would read his reports on civilian casualties. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2355.4399999999996s)]
*  He said that he and his colleagues would joke that they could staple cash to the reports [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2361.24s)]
*  and still they would fall on deaf ears. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2365.8399999999997s)]
*  That's very dark. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2368.72s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2371.12s)]
*  I have inordinate respect for the people in this department who've not only had different [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2372.2s)]
*  views of the policies that we pursued, but have expressed those views, including in what's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2381.2s)]
*  been a time-honored tradition of the department, which is something called a descent channel [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2386.24s)]
*  cable. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2389.64s)]
*  This is the ability of any officer in the department to send what we a message, a memo, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2390.64s)]
*  a cable to me reflecting their differences. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2397.6s)]
*  And every single one of those winds up on my desk. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2401.72s)]
*  Every single one of those I read, every single one of those I respond to, including 20 or [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2405.88s)]
*  so on Gaza. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2411.48s)]
*  So and some, of course, have brought forward some of the some of these facts. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2413.52s)]
*  I didn't need to send channel cables. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2422.2s)]
*  I read everything. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2424.2799999999997s)]
*  I comment on everything. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2425.56s)]
*  I look for answers on everything. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2427.04s)]
*  Does that mean we get to the right answers every time? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2431.7599999999998s)]
*  But does it mean we're intensely focused on it? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2432.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2434.0s)]
*  And again, my goal has been to end this conflict in Gaza in a way that makes sure that October [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2434.52s)]
*  7th doesn't happen again, that ends the suffering of people and does it in an enduring way that [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2440.04s)]
*  brings the hostages home. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2443.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think there's still hostages alive? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2444.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2446.44s)]
*  I think there's still hostages in Gaza. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2446.96s)]
*  I think there's still hostages in Gaza. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2448.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2450.04s)]
*  Do you, Secretary Blinken, worry that perhaps you have been presiding over what the world [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2450.56s)]
*  will see as a genocide? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2461.28s)]
*  No. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2466.76s)]
*  It's not, first of all. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2469.04s)]
*  Second, as to how the world sees it, I can't, I can't fully, I can't fully understand [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2471.08s)]
*  I can't, I can't fully answer to that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2477.32s)]
*  But they, everyone has to look at, look at the facts and draw their own conclusions from [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2482.36s)]
*  those facts. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2490.48s)]
*  And my conclusions are clear. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2491.8s)]
*  I think as well, there is in the wake of this horrific suffering, the traumatization of [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2494.6000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli population, the Palestinian population and many others, there's also a light that [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2505.88s)]
*  one can see that offers the prospect of a much different and much better future. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2514.28s)]
*  It doesn't bring back the lives of those who've been lost. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  It doesn't bring back the parents of the children in Gaza who've lost their parents or the children [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2523.92s)]
*  for parents in Israel on October 7th who lost theirs. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2532.28s)]
*  But it does offer a different way forward. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2537.6000000000004s)]
*  And we've done an extraordinary amount of work to build the foundation for that. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2539.96s)]
*  First, you've got to end the conflict in Gaza. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2544.4s)]
*  We've had we and I believe it will end and it will probably end more or less on the terms [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2547.76s)]
*  that we've established in the hostage ceasefire agreement that President Biden put forward [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2553.28s)]
*  that we got the whole world behind. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2556.44s)]
*  It will land there. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2557.8s)]
*  Second, you have to make sure it's enduring. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2558.8s)]
*  We've spent months working on a post-conflict plan with many countries in the region, Arab [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2561.08s)]
*  partners in particular. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2566.04s)]
*  And that plan is if we don't have the opportunity to start to try to implement it through a [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2567.64s)]
*  hostage ceasefire agreement in the next couple of weeks, we will hand it off to the incoming [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2571.88s)]
*  Trump administration and they can decide whether to move forward with it. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2575.4s)]
*  Third, we have the prospect of a totally different region with normalized relations between [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia and many other countries. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2583.6s)]
*  Israel integrated into the security architecture of the region and because it will be a requirement [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2586.3199999999997s)]
*  of any such normalization agreement, a real pathway to a Palestinian state. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2592.4s)]
*  We've done all of the work to put that put those plans in place. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2596.92s)]
*  Normalization with Saudi Arabia, that can happen tomorrow based on the work that we've [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2600.2799999999997s)]
*  done, the investments we've made. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2605.24s)]
*  Once there is an end to the conflict in Gaza and an agreement on a credible pathway forward [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2606.72s)]
*  for the Palestinians, all of that work is there. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2610.92s)]
*  That's what we'll be handing over. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2613.0s)]
*  But it requires leaders to make really hard decisions and it requires somehow moving [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2614.68s)]
*  beyond the the trauma of two societies, Israeli and Palestinian, that we see and that [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2619.96s)]
*  have taken root. That's going to be the really the really hard part. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2626.7599999999998s)]
*  Your tenure, as we've said, has been filled with many complicated conflicts. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2630.24s)]
*  At the same time, there's been a lot of reporting on President Biden's declining abilities [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2634.12s)]
*  over the course of his term. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2638.8399999999997s)]
*  You are one of the closest people to him. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2640.7999999999997s)]
*  You have worked with him for decades. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2643.12s)]
*  By some accounts, he considers you a surrogate son. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2645.52s)]
*  This is a delicate question to ask, but I do feel that many Americans want to understand. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2649.7999999999997s)]
*  If you saw changes from the man that you knew so well. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2658.3999999999996s)]
*  Look, here's what I can tell you. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2663.3199999999997s)]
*  Look at everything we've done, everything I believe that we've achieved in this [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2666.16s)]
*  administration at home and around the world. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2671.48s)]
*  And whether you agree or not, I think there's a very strong record of achievement, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2676.28s)]
*  historic in many ways. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2684.52s)]
*  Every single one of those achievements has been the product of a decision that was made [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2686.44s)]
*  by the president of the United States, by President Biden, not by me, not by others in [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2691.48s)]
*  the administration, by the president. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2696.36s)]
*  His judgment, his decision, his action has been reflected in what we've done, what we've achieved. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2698.36s)]
*  That's the basis upon which to judge whether he's been an effective president. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2709.44s)]
*  And I believe the answer is resoundingly yes. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2713.6s)]
*  Last summer, my colleague Robert Draper reported that people in the diplomatic corps [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2715.88s)]
*  worried that the president's memory, for example, was showing signs of slipping while he [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2720.04s)]
*  was meeting with foreign leaders. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2723.88s)]
*  Look, we all change. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2725.56s)]
*  We all age. I have a four soon to be five year old daughter. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2728.52s)]
*  I was sitting with her the other day and now four years in. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2733.0s)]
*  And she was saying, oh, daddy's wearing a white shirt. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2736.44s)]
*  He's got on a blue suit. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2739.2799999999997s)]
*  He has black shoes and he has gray hair. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2740.56s)]
*  And I said, no, no, no, my hair is brown. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2742.24s)]
*  And she said, no, it's gray. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2744.3199999999997s)]
*  We all get older. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2746.52s)]
*  We all change as we get older. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2747.2s)]
*  But again, what I've seen when it comes to. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2748.2799999999997s)]
*  Judgment, when it comes to decisions that. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2752.68s)]
*  Do right by the country, he's shown that judgment. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2757.8399999999997s)]
*  He's made those decisions on a personal note. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2761.4799999999996s)]
*  Your own story is very much defined by this fight against autocracy. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2764.9599999999996s)]
*  Your stepfather was a Holocaust survivor who was saved from the death camps by American soldiers. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2771.7599999999998s)]
*  It's an incredible story. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2779.28s)]
*  You've said that you learned lessons from him about what our country is and what it [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2781.6s)]
*  represents and what it means when the United States is engaged in leading. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2785.32s)]
*  And I'm wondering, as you look at the end of your tenure, as you've been leading over [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2789.44s)]
*  the last four years and you're handing off, as we've discussed, many of these [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2795.0s)]
*  conflicts that are still unresolved. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2800.92s)]
*  And you have come under a lot of criticism. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2805.36s)]
*  Do his lessons strike you differently now than they did before that you've been through [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2808.52s)]
*  the. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2812.52s)]
*  The fire, so you will, of really being the person at the forefront of making these very, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2814.16s)]
*  very difficult choices. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, my my friend Tom Friedman wrote a few months ago, a column that basically [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2820.68s)]
*  said, parents, don't let your sons and daughters grow up to be Secretary of State. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2826.3999999999996s)]
*  It's a different world than it was when some of my predecessors were doing this. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2831.2s)]
*  And I think at the heart of that is something I've seen over 32 years that I've been [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2836.2s)]
*  engaged in foreign policy, starting at the very beginning of the Clinton administration, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2841.12s)]
*  now concluding with the Biden administration, which is that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2844.08s)]
*  Now, and in recent years, there's been a greater multiplicity, a greater complexity, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2848.2s)]
*  a greater interconnectedness of problems than ever before. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2854.04s)]
*  And they're happening at a speed that we've never experienced before. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2858.9199999999996s)]
*  And. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2862.7999999999997s)]
*  As a result, it's a very different challenge, but some basic fundamentals haven't [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2864.48s)]
*  changed, at least for me. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2869.48s)]
*  And yes, it does go to the lessons that I learned from my stepfather, from my father, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2871.2799999999997s)]
*  and other relatives, almost all of whom came to this country as immigrants, as refugees, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2877.44s)]
*  fleeing oppression, fleeing the case of my stepfather, the war that and the Holocaust [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2884.32s)]
*  that eliminated his entire family and each in one way or another, finding themselves [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2892.6800000000003s)]
*  on our shores and having seen the United States as the the last best hope, having come [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2896.8s)]
*  here, rebuilt their lives and flourished because this is the country that we are. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2903.2s)]
*  That hasn't changed for me. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2908.8399999999997s)]
*  My stepfather came to the United States after surviving the Holocaust, eventually made [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2909.92s)]
*  his way here and even served in the Kennedy administration. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2916.6s)]
*  And back then, you could become an American by special act of Congress, which he was. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2920.56s)]
*  So Congress passes an act and he became an American citizen. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2925.2s)]
*  And I have my family has that act. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2928.08s)]
*  And he used to say, never forget. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2931.76s)]
*  I'm an American by choice. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2936.44s)]
*  You're an American by accident and birth. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2938.52s)]
*  And I take that very seriously because what it means to me is there is an extraordinary [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2941.88s)]
*  responsibility that comes with being an American, a responsibility that comes from being part [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2948.2000000000003s)]
*  of the greatest country on earth. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2956.0s)]
*  And if you're in public service, as I've had the incredible privilege of being for three [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2957.08s)]
*  or two years, a responsibility to try to use that in the best way that you can to. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2960.48s)]
*  Do better by your fellow citizens, but also people around the world and every time, every [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2966.56s)]
*  place I've been around the world, everything I've heard, even with criticism, intense [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2970.36s)]
*  criticism of our policies is people want the United States involved. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2975.16s)]
*  They want us engaged. They want us leading. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2978.64s)]
*  They know that we're more likely to get to a solution when we're at the table than without [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2980.88s)]
*  us. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2986.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2988.48s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2989.64s)]
*  Great to be with you today. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2990.8s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYtF1BGqHg&t=2991.56s)]
