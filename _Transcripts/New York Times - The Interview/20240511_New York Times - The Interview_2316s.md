# Charlamagne Tha God Wonâ€™t Take Sides
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=0.0s)]
*  I interview a lot of politicians. And I'll be honest, I'm jealous of how many of them [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=9.92s)]
*  want to talk to Charlemagne the God. As the co-host of the wildly popular radio show The [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=15.6s)]
*  Breakfast Club, Charlemagne, who was born Leonard McKelvey, has become a go-to interviewer for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=21.04s)]
*  politicians who want to reach the show's largely Black audience and who aren't afraid of a good, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=27.96s)]
*  tough conversation. And this year, with polls showing Donald Trump's growing popularity with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=33.2s)]
*  Black male voters, reaching that audience for candidates in both parties is more critical [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=38.92s)]
*  than ever. The Breakfast Club has nearly 6 million listeners every month on the radio, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=44.88s)]
*  plus the YouTube channel, the podcast, and the clips from its interviews that regularly go viral. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=51.5s)]
*  Even if you've never listened to the show, you probably know about some of the more memorable [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=56.96s)]
*  episodes. Like in 2020, when then-candidate Joe Biden went on and dropped this line, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=61.6s)]
*  if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=66.86s)]
*  Even though Biden got huge blowback for that comment, Charlemagne endorsed the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=71.92s)]
*  Democratic ticket. But this time around, he said he won't endorse anyone. That decision has led to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=77.56s)]
*  some speculation about his personal politics. It also made me curious about how he wants to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=84.52s)]
*  wield his considerable influence and what he thinks of the potential shift happening [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=90.16s)]
*  among Black voters. When we spoke, Charlemagne was getting ready to publish a new book, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=94.72s)]
*  Get Honest or Die Lying, Why Small Talk Sucks. And he had just come off a stint guest-hosting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  The Daily Show, where some of his comments got a lot of attention. Here's my conversation with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=105.72s)]
*  Charlemagne the God. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=111.72s)]
*  Your new book is about small talk and how you think it's bad. So I want to start with some big [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=114.52s)]
*  issues. Let's get right to it. We know what we're here for. Exactly. You just went on The Daily [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=124.56s)]
*  Show and you went after DEI initiatives. That's diversity, equity and inclusion. You said it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=132.16s)]
*  mostly garbage. It's a PR stunt. And you said it makes things worse for Black people because of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=138.64s)]
*  the backlash effect. Can you just tell me a little bit about why you wanted to take that on in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=143.56s)]
*  particular? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=147.36s)]
*  I don't have a problem with DEI. I was talking about corporate DEI initiatives that were created [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=148.6s)]
*  after George Floyd, those issues that were more symbolism over substance, those corporations that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=154.52s)]
*  pledged all of this money to different Black initiatives and that nobody ever saw any of that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=161.88s)]
*  money. I'm talking about the corporations who do things like putting a Simone Biles poster in the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=167.72s)]
*  break room and saying something like, we're head over heroes for diversity here. That's the kind of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=174.84s)]
*  DEI initiatives I were talking about. I'm not talking about DEI overall. And it's so interesting [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  to me because I love what the right wing media does. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=186.2s)]
*  And when I say that- [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  I was about to say, you got widely celebrated for this. I actually first saw this on Fox News. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  But they do that on purpose because they won't listen to 95%, 99% of anything I'll say, but [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=196.6s)]
*  they'll take that one line and say Charlemagne de Garde says DEI is mostly garbage. And then what [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=203.8s)]
*  happens, people on the left, instead of actually going to listen to what I actually said, they just [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=211.0s)]
*  respond to the narrative that was created by right wing media. So now you got people on the left [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=217.56s)]
*  attacking me and attacking a narrative that really is nothing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=222.52s)]
*  So then why wade into these waters? You know the DEI is at the center of a huge cultural battle. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=228.36s)]
*  You know that this is one of the right's main talking points. They think that DEI is indoctrination. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=233.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=238.84s)]
*  So then why go on The Daily Show and choose to- [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  Because it sparks good conversation and it's a conversation that we need to have. Maybe I just [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  want DEI and the corporate work environments to be better. I can be sitting in a corporate boardroom [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=245.08s)]
*  and be hearing all of this stuff in a sensitivity training meeting and I'm like this isn't even for me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=251.72s)]
*  So this is based on your personal experience of sitting in these meetings. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=257.16s)]
*  Absolutely. We take these tests at iHeartRadio and you got to answer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=259.72s)]
*  certain questions and you know what that's about. But my biggest issue with corporate DEI is literally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=263.8s)]
*  just the performativeness of it all. Especially when we're talking about the money that was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=269.24s)]
*  pledged by all of these different corporations that nobody ever saw. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=274.6s)]
*  So there was a lot of backlash to this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=280.12s)]
*  And a lot of people who agreed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=283.48s)]
*  And a lot of people who agreed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=285.08s)]
*  And not just people on the right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  But what I found interesting about all the comments is this thing that happens with you a lot. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=287.8s)]
*  Which is people wondering as they have for a while what is Charlemagne the God all about? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Where does he stand politically? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=298.92s)]
*  That's so funny you say that. I promise you as I was walking in here this white guy stops me in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=300.52s)]
*  the street. He had on glasses, some khakis, a sweater and he goes, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=306.04s)]
*  you're Charlemagne right? And I go yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  And he goes man I like when you talk politics. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=311.88s)]
*  And he goes man I think that it's going to be a civil war in this country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=314.36s)]
*  He said that's what you need to talk about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  He said I don't care who wins. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  He said I don't care if it's Trump. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=319.88s)]
*  I don't care if it's Biden. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  I feel like it's going to be a civil war in this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=322.12s)]
*  And he goes what side are you on? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=323.88s)]
*  And I'm like I'm not on any side. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=326.04s)]
*  And I think that's the problem with American politics and just America period. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=328.68s)]
*  People think if me as a black man if I criticize Democrats then I'm supporting MAGA. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=333.0s)]
*  But if I criticize Donald Trump and Republicans then I'm a Democratic shill. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=339.8s)]
*  Why can't I just be a person who deals in nuance? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=345.32s)]
*  Like what happened to just being objective and seeing things on both sides? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=348.52s)]
*  Because nothing is all right and nothing is all wrong either. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=352.36s)]
*  Well I think what people would probably answer is that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=355.48s)]
*  the rise of Trump has really polarized people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=358.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=361.0s)]
*  And so to say oh I don't take a side some people especially on the left would say well [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=361.8s)]
*  that's not right either. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=367.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=368.44000000000005s)]
*  I think we do ourselves a grave disservice by thinking I can't criticize Democrats [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=370.44000000000005s)]
*  and I can't criticize Republicans and still know who I want to vote for in November [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=377.24s)]
*  in order to preserve democracy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=383.88000000000005s)]
*  I've been on every there's not a show I've been on. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  When they asked me about Donald Trump I say the same thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=388.68s)]
*  He's a threat to democracy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=391.24s)]
*  He literally said let's suspend the Constitution to overthrow the results of an election. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=392.92s)]
*  You saw his lawyers in the court saying well he never agreed to support the Constitution. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=397.48s)]
*  He led an insurrection of this country on January 6th and people just act like you know [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=401.88s)]
*  there was a bunch of you know kids wiling out at spring break in Miami. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  I say these things over and over and over. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=411.88s)]
*  But if somebody like you know John Carl says to me well and this happens it's in the interview [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=415.88s)]
*  you can watch it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=421.08s)]
*  Well President Biden says these things too about Donald Trump. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  Why don't you think it resonates? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=424.2s)]
*  And I say because he's an uninspiring candidate who doesn't have any main character energy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=426.28s)]
*  The right will take that one clip and say Charlemagne says Joe Biden is an uninspiring [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  candidate who has no main character energy and once again everybody on the left attacks [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=437.88s)]
*  that narrative instead of going to watch the interview and taking the narrative they should [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  be using which is Charlemagne says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=448.2s)]
*  We are insane right now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=453.4s)]
*  I blame the media so much for what's happening. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=455.4s)]
*  You are the media. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=458.2s)]
*  Yes but listen look at what I'm doing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=459.4s)]
*  I'm being objective. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=461.0s)]
*  I tell people all the time if you lie to them about Democrats they won't believe you when [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=462.2s)]
*  you tell them the truth about Republicans. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=466.44s)]
*  So why would I sit there and lie to people about the flaws I see in the Democratic Party? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=468.52s)]
*  Well you've asked why you should take a side publicly. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=473.32s)]
*  I think some people would say because you Charlemagne have a different responsibility [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=478.12s)]
*  because you have this particular platform. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  You know people your audience of millions do look to you because they respect you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=486.28s)]
*  They listen to you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=491.64s)]
*  You're not just some guy in a voting booth. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=493.24s)]
*  You're a guy who really does have an impact and they want to know what you think. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=495.0s)]
*  I'm telling them what I think. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=502.6s)]
*  Let's go back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=506.36s)]
*  I actually want to ask you about your political evolution and how you came up. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=507.56s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=513.96s)]
*  Did you think of politics at all when you were growing up? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=514.76s)]
*  Did you think about the way things were? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=517.08s)]
*  A hundred percent but you know my mind state at the time was a little bit different [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=519.72s)]
*  because I grew up Jehovah's Witness. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  So when you grow up Jehovah's Witness you know you don't vote. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=525.0s)]
*  That's not what they do. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=527.32s)]
*  They stay away from it but I also you know read a lot of books. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=528.36s)]
*  My mother was an English teacher. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=531.72s)]
*  She told me verbatim read things that don't pertain to you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=533.24s)]
*  You know I read so many things when I was younger. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  Everything from Judy Blume to Are You There Goddess Me Margaret to my dad [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  giving me the autobiography of Malcolm X. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=544.76s)]
*  But then you listen to you know Jay-Z saying things like you know back then [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  he was saying things like government F government. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=551.0s)]
*  We politic ourselves you know where I'm from in South Carolina. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=552.76s)]
*  We were all always aware of government but we had a different [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=556.76s)]
*  view of government back then and that's like government will never work for us. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  It will never work for us because we're we're black. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=564.76s)]
*  So the only thing we could do is try to do for self. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=567.0s)]
*  But you know as I've grown older I realized like oh this politics thing [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=569.24s)]
*  can really influence influence people in a real way. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=573.96s)]
*  You left South Carolina when you got your big break on the Wendy Williams experience. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=577.72s)]
*  You end up in New York. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=581.64s)]
*  You start the Breakfast Club in 2010. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=583.4s)]
*  What were you trying to do with the show then? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=586.36s)]
*  Same exact thing I'm trying to do now. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  I've always said that you know the yin and the yang of life to me is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=590.52s)]
*  ratchetness and righteousness. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=594.12s)]
*  And so it's just like you know for every rapper that comes on the show [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=595.96s)]
*  who you might look at and think you know this person is ratchet. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=601.0s)]
*  I try to bring the spiritual leaders on the show. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=604.28s)]
*  I try to bring the authors on the show. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=606.84s)]
*  Not try I do. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=608.68s)]
*  First time I got on the air I think was like 99 2000. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=610.84s)]
*  I've always done that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=613.56s)]
*  You can go back to my track record when I was on the radio in Charleston, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=614.84s)]
*  South Carolina Columbia, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=617.8s)]
*  South Carolina you know Philadelphia. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=619.24s)]
*  I was getting in trouble for bringing the mayor of Philly on my show. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=621.64s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=624.76s)]
*  Mayor Nutter was the mayor of Philly at the time and there was something going on in Philly where [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=625.48s)]
*  they were about to close all the libraries and all the rec centers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=629.72s)]
*  And this was like 2010 when you know Philly was like really really on fire you know with crime [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=633.88s)]
*  and violence right. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=639.08s)]
*  And I remember it was on the front page of the paper that oh and they were going to cut a lot of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=639.88s)]
*  lot of the police so they were going to cut a large part of the police close the rec centers [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=643.96s)]
*  and like the libraries. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=647.8s)]
*  People were freaking out because they knew what that was going to do to the city. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=649.16s)]
*  And I remember Mayor Nutter came on the show to let everybody know no everything is fine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=653.56s)]
*  We got the money. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  None of that is happening. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  Cool. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  I remember a radio consultant at the time literally said to me when the show was over [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=660.28s)]
*  and I was in his office a radio consultant he goes you know yeah nobody really cares [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=664.28s)]
*  about about the mayor. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=670.68s)]
*  I guess like you know people want to hear from like Beyonce. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=671.64s)]
*  And I said to him I said yeah it's easy for you to say that because you don't live in Philadelphia. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=675.16s)]
*  White guy that didn't live in Philadelphia you don't live here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=678.52s)]
*  So you flew in to listen to the radio to consult me on what I should be talking about to the city [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=681.08s)]
*  of Philadelphia and you're going to fly back to wherever you're from and not even care about [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=687.16s)]
*  what's going on in the city. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  That was the mayor of Philadelphia talking about something that was a real concern to the people [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  of Philadelphia. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=699.64s)]
*  So that shows how out of touch a lot of these programmers and people that run these you know [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=700.76s)]
*  media corporations are. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=705.64s)]
*  And I've always pushed against that grain. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=707.24s)]
*  I mean tell me where that comes from when you bring the mayor of Philadelphia on to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=711.16s)]
*  what is a popular culture show essentially. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  What did you understand that you were up to? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=717.8s)]
*  I understood people. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=720.52s)]
*  I understood that you know my people black people people in hip hop we care more than just things [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=721.64s)]
*  about hip hop. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=727.0s)]
*  There's never been a time where hip hop has not talked about things of socially redeeming value. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=727.56s)]
*  Like there's always been a Chuck D. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  There's always been a killer Mike. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=734.12s)]
*  I don't know why people think that you know black people are so one dimensional that you can't [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=736.36s)]
*  bring an elected official on a hip hop radio station where so many people that are directly [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=741.96s)]
*  affected by the things these elected officials are doing are listening. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=748.04s)]
*  Like why wouldn't my audience be receptive to that? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=751.96s)]
*  You know we talk about diversity right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=754.92s)]
*  Like when we talk about the TEI thing I feel like you know black people with our platforms [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  and just in society we have to be way more diverse than white people do because we have to know [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=762.2s)]
*  what's going on with a little bit of everybody because we deal with a little bit of everybody [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=767.64s)]
*  and we encounter a little bit of everybody. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=772.12s)]
*  It's easy to stay insulated in your you know bubble and just be around whiteness for the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=774.28s)]
*  majority of your life. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=780.92s)]
*  That's never been my experience so I don't understand why we can't do both and do it well. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=782.04s)]
*  The only way you can't do both and do it well is if you're not equipped and if you're being [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=788.6s)]
*  realistic there are a lot of people who aren't equipped to talk to a Kodak black and a president [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=793.96s)]
*  Biden. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=799.48s)]
*  That's a very unique skill set that probably comes from somebody who's black. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=800.36s)]
*  Does one help you prepare for the other? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=806.12s)]
*  I mean what is it? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=809.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=810.44s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=811.16s)]
*  I've never approached any conversation with fear. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=812.6s)]
*  And if you can stare down a so-called gangster rapper who's got the whole crew in the studio, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=817.88s)]
*  if I can ask those questions to him I can damn sure ask these questions to an elected official. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay I'm really curious how you prepare for interviews like this because you know you just [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  had Mayor Eric Adams on. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=841.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=844.12s)]
*  And it was a pretty wild interview. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=845.4s)]
*  I'm just curious about your choice to have him mostly interviewed by a former public defender. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=850.44s)]
*  Ole Yemi O'Lauren. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=856.84s)]
*  Yeah we can just say Ole. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=859.64s)]
*  Okay so Ole came on to interview him. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=861.16s)]
*  First of all did Eric Adams know he was walking into an interview like that? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  Meaning combative and with an activist? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=867.32s)]
*  Oh combative. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=870.36s)]
*  I don't think he thought he was walking into a combative interview but I think people know [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=872.28s)]
*  the Breakfast Club. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=876.2s)]
*  I think that you know for the most part if you come on to Breakfast Club you're going to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=877.08s)]
*  get asked some like you know really tough questions. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=880.84s)]
*  He did not know that Ole was going to be there but we've been rotating, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=883.48s)]
*  even though we have our new third co-host who is Jess Hilarious, but you know all last year we [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=887.88s)]
*  rotated you know guest hosts. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=891.48s)]
*  So I've been watching Ole you know for a long time and I like a lot of the things that she [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=893.5600000000001s)]
*  talks about and I think that she you know challenges Mayor Eric Adams in a real way. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=898.28s)]
*  I think she asked some real questions and you know we see the state of New York right now. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=902.52s)]
*  New Yorkers have real questions about New York City. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=908.36s)]
*  You know is New York City safe? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=912.04s)]
*  The migrant issue is a real issue. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=914.36s)]
*  I felt like there was a lot of real high level conversations that needed to be had and I [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=916.36s)]
*  thought Ole would be perfect for him and I thought she did a fantastic job and I thought [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=920.92s)]
*  the mayor did a fantastic job. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=924.76s)]
*  That made me like Mayor Adams even more because what I realized is it's something I always knew [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=926.36s)]
*  about politicians. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=931.16s)]
*  He's just doing his best. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=932.28s)]
*  Like you got to think about what he inherited it like what we just came out of in regards [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=934.04s)]
*  to COVID and the hole that he's digging himself out of. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=939.24s)]
*  So he's just really really attempting to do his best and I thought it was you know [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=942.36s)]
*  very interesting to watch him not run from the tough questions, not duck, show real emotion. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=946.76s)]
*  Like I thought that that was a great conversation between a mayor of a major city and one of his [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=954.44s)]
*  constituents. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=959.48s)]
*  Is that what you're hoping these moments will provide like just authenticity I guess? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=960.28s)]
*  Authenticity that leads to authentic information and great conversation that people can actually [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  learn from. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=971.48s)]
*  And you know even just from the feedback I've gotten from people like some people feel like [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=972.28s)]
*  Ole might have been too tough on the mayor. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=977.72s)]
*  Some people feel like the mayor did a great job. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't think you can ever be too tough on an elected official. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=982.6s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=986.44s)]
*  Like they're an elected official. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=987.32s)]
*  They're there for a reason. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  Like they wake up in the morning ready to be in the hot seat. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=989.8000000000001s)]
*  With that said who do you decide that you want to go really hard on? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=995.24s)]
*  Because I've listened to some of your recent interviews with conservatives like Larry Elder, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, Candace Owens and they weren't nearly as combative. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1003.16s)]
*  That's not what the internet says. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1007.8000000000001s)]
*  Everybody else says other than Candace Owens they felt like we was too hard on Larry Elder. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1009.72s)]
*  They felt like we was too hard on Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1014.6s)]
*  The second conversation we had with Vivek Ramaswamy was more smooth. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1017.16s)]
*  That's the one I'm referencing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1020.84s)]
*  But the reason that was more smooth is because he's not running for office anymore. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1022.36s)]
*  It's an inconsequential conversation. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1025.96s)]
*  You're not running for anything. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1028.6s)]
*  Candace Owens is not an elected official. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1029.72s)]
*  I think this right here shows me what's wrong with our country. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1031.24s)]
*  I'm interested in why you think that shows you what's wrong with this country. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1034.68s)]
*  I have to be honest watching some of those interviews I was wondering why there wasn't [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1038.76s)]
*  more pushback on questionable assertions. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1043.48s)]
*  Give me some examples. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1047.32s)]
*  Yeah real misinformation. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1048.44s)]
*  Larry Elder saying that the nuclear family was ruined by welfare or Vivek's great replacement [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1049.96s)]
*  theory which he's been pushing which is a racist theory that Democrats are bringing [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1055.8s)]
*  in black and brown people to replace the white race. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1060.2s)]
*  We definitely pushed back on Larry Elder when he said the nuclear family. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1062.2s)]
*  Was ruined by the welfare system being brought in by the 45s. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1067.16s)]
*  Yeah in that conversation Tesla and Figaro was on and Tesla was definitely pushing back [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1070.68s)]
*  on Larry. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1076.04s)]
*  Like people really don't and that's another thing right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1076.44s)]
*  But I guess it's like where are you in this? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1079.3200000000002s)]
*  Like what is your role? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1081.4s)]
*  Do you see yourself as a mediator? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1082.44s)]
*  This is your show. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1084.04s)]
*  Yeah I mean it depends. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1086.28s)]
*  Like I'm listening a lot of times. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1087.16s)]
*  Like I don't approach any conversation like I want to have a confrontation. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1089.0800000000002s)]
*  But you go hard on hip hop people. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1093.4s)]
*  I've seen you do that and they're not elected officials. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1096.76s)]
*  They're people with power. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1100.2s)]
*  Isn't it less about being an elected official and more about who has power? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1102.44s)]
*  It depends what you're doing with your power. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1105.8s)]
*  When you talk about hip hop telling somebody that their music is whack. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1106.92s)]
*  That's really an inconsequential conversation. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1110.76s)]
*  That's not real power. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1113.08s)]
*  Mayor Adams has actual power. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1114.6s)]
*  Elected officials that are in those positions they have real power. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1116.6s)]
*  What is me telling a rapper that their music is whack? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1120.92s)]
*  I don't think you're a good rapper. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1124.04s)]
*  How is that consequential to what's going on in our society? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1125.72s)]
*  And if somebody already has an opinion that I don't agree with. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1129.8s)]
*  Like let's just say it's an issue. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1133.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1135.24s)]
*  Like everybody was talking about things that Candace Owens has said in the past. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1135.48s)]
*  If I already know her opinion on that and I know we're not going to agree on that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1140.92s)]
*  What would I be bringing it up for other than to be performative? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1146.52s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1151.48s)]
*  You have noted yourself that people come on to pander to your audience politically. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1153.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean you had that conversation very virally with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1159.8s)]
*  and presidential candidate in 2016. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1166.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you feel protective of your audience? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1168.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  But I don't think... [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1173.48s)]
*  Let me word just correctly. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1177.24s)]
*  Because I might see something later and be like, eh, I was wrong. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1179.0s)]
*  But I don't think Democrats pander as much as they used to. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1182.68s)]
*  At least when they come to Breakfast Club. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1189.24s)]
*  Because they know when they come to Breakfast Club, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1191.16s)]
*  even when they sit down with me, we're going to have a real conversation. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1192.68s)]
*  I think that's why they continue to come. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1196.44s)]
*  Like somebody like Secretary Pete. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1198.04s)]
*  Secretary Pete has not stopped coming to Breakfast Club. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1200.2s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1203.16s)]
*  Secretary of Transportation. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1203.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1205.08s)]
*  I tell Pete that every time he comes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1206.2s)]
*  And the reason I tell Pete that every time he comes is because [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1207.96s)]
*  a lot of these people only like to come around when it's election season. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1211.64s)]
*  And that's when it really looks like pandering. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1215.96s)]
*  That's when it really looks like dream selling. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it should be. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1220.52s)]
*  You should be trying to sell us something. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1223.08s)]
*  You should be trying to encourage us to go out there and vote for you. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1225.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1229.08s)]
*  Cut more student loan debt. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1229.72s)]
*  You know? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1231.64s)]
*  Do those things. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1233.4s)]
*  Pardon more people, you know, who are in prison. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1234.44s)]
*  On a federal level for marijuana, you know, nonviolent drug offenses. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1237.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1240.84s)]
*  Continue to do that, especially in an election year. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1241.24s)]
*  And let's push for more of that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1244.36s)]
*  But guys like Secretary Pete, they've been coming for the last four years. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1246.36s)]
*  That says something to me. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1250.76s)]
*  And I definitely know it says something to our audience. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1252.84s)]
*  And so I respect him for that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1255.48s)]
*  You brought it up. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1258.76s)]
*  It's election season. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1260.52s)]
*  Listen, a lot has been made of these polls showing black support for the Democrats cratering. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  You've been asked about this a lot. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1269.48s)]
*  I'm just wondering what you're thinking as more and more of these polls keep showing the same thing. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, you might see a slight uptick in black people voting for Trump this year. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1277.72s)]
*  But I think it's overstated. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1285.08s)]
*  I think they said the number is like 22%. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1286.44s)]
*  22% of black people are going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1288.68s)]
*  I think the biggest thing that people are going to have to fight against this year is the couch. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1292.68s)]
*  And that's what I've been saying. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1297.56s)]
*  I keep saying it over and over. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1298.52s)]
*  This election is three options. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1300.44s)]
*  Republicans who are the crooks, Democrats who are the cowards, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1302.68s)]
*  because they don't fight enough for nothing, and the couch. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1305.88s)]
*  And the couch is voter apathy. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1308.68s)]
*  And I think that, you know, a lot of people are just discouraged with politics, period. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1310.04s)]
*  There's all this talk about people being tired of Democrats. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1315.32s)]
*  No, people are just tired of politics, period. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  Come November, man, people are just going to be like, eh. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1322.4399999999998s)]
*  Because this is probably the most, and what I'm about to say is going to sound so cliche. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1326.04s)]
*  This is probably the most consequential election of my lifetime. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1332.28s)]
*  I'm not going to say of all time. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1337.0s)]
*  But it's hard to get people to believe that because we say that about every presidential election. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1338.2s)]
*  Because every Republican candidate has been demonized in that way. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1344.44s)]
*  So now that you really do have the woof out there, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1349.72s)]
*  you look like the party who cried woof because you made, you put everything on the same scale. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1353.5600000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump guy is different. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1361.24s)]
*  The things he wants to do is different. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1363.64s)]
*  You've seen what he's capable of doing and willing to do. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1365.88s)]
*  Now that he knows the things that he can get away with, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1371.24s)]
*  and the people around him know the things that they can get away with, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1374.52s)]
*  you think they're not going to go all the way for it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1377.56s)]
*  But it's hard to explain that to people because, you know, people have been hearing [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1380.44s)]
*  into democracy every time they're the Republican presidential candidate. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1388.3600000000001s)]
*  So, Charlamagne, I'm hearing you and the thing that I'm hearing you say is that you believe that Trump [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1392.6000000000001s)]
*  is the wolf at the door, that democracy is under threat. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1397.96s)]
*  And I've also heard you say, I will not endorse President Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1402.04s)]
*  What does that have to do with voting, though? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1408.68s)]
*  I've never said I'm not voting. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1410.52s)]
*  If I'm laying it out right there on the table, and I'm telling you that I'm voting to preserve democracy, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1411.96s)]
*  who do you think out of those two options is willing to preserve democracy? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1418.44s)]
*  Just because I don't want to jump out there and say, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1424.04s)]
*  I'm endorsing this person or I'm endorsing that person. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1426.8400000000001s)]
*  I miss the days when nobody talked about, you know, who they were voting for. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1428.92s)]
*  I don't know when we had to start laying all that on the table. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1432.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not endorsing because I just feel like I've been burned with that before, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1435.48s)]
*  you know, because you put your name on the line, you endorse somebody, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1439.08s)]
*  you tell your audience this is who you should go out there and vote for, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1443.48s)]
*  and your audience goes and does it. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1446.76s)]
*  And then when they don't see these things that they thought were going to get pushed through, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1448.28s)]
*  they don't understand civics. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1452.28s)]
*  They're not thinking about that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1453.32s)]
*  They're like, all they know is Charlemagne told me to vote for this person [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1454.44s)]
*  because this was going to happen and this didn't happen. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1457.8s)]
*  One of the things you have been talking about is [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1460.92s)]
*  how they haven't been able to make the things that they've done real to people. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1464.28s)]
*  Messaging sucks. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1473.32s)]
*  I say it all the time. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1475.32s)]
*  The language of politics is dead. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1476.6s)]
*  If you've ever had a conversation with 90% of these elected officials, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1477.8s)]
*  I love to use 90%. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1482.6s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1483.56s)]
*  And I'll use examples. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1486.28s)]
*  If you talk to Vice President Kamala Harris behind the scenes, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1487.08s)]
*  you're like, where is this person? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1491.8s)]
*  If America saw this person, if this person, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1493.96s)]
*  and you saw glimpses of it when she used to be [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1499.08s)]
*  like holding it to those people in those Senate hearings, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1502.6s)]
*  holding it to those other officials. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1505.6399999999999s)]
*  But if you saw this person and this person decided to say, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1507.16s)]
*  you know what, I'm not going to let Fox News manipulate my narratives anymore. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1511.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to go on Fox News and have these conversations with this audience. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1515.5600000000002s)]
*  You'll be surprised how many people that's probably watching Fox News, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1521.0s)]
*  those hypothetical swing voters they love so much. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  They'd be like, I like her. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1527.0800000000002s)]
*  But it's the craziest psychological mind. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1529.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1535.0800000000002s)]
*  When you talk to these people and then you see them in front of the camera, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1535.88s)]
*  and you're like, who is this person? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1542.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm not just putting it on the Vice President, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1545.3200000000002s)]
*  because I think that there's a whole Democratic party of surrogates [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1547.3200000000002s)]
*  that President Biden should be using. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1553.8000000000002s)]
*  I think he should be using Governor Shapiro. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1556.0400000000002s)]
*  I think he should be using Governor Newsom, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1558.44s)]
*  because I think Governor Newsom did a great job of elevating himself [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1560.6000000000001s)]
*  in the conversation by going on Fox News. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1563.64s)]
*  By going on Sean Hannity's show. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1565.64s)]
*  By debating Ron DeSantis. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1567.0s)]
*  I think he should be using Governor Westmore of Maryland. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1568.68s)]
*  I think he should be using those individuals [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1571.5600000000002s)]
*  to really tell the story of what's going on. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1574.3600000000001s)]
*  But I do put a lot on the Vice President, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1577.0s)]
*  because I think she's so talented. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1579.96s)]
*  You just mentioned a whole bunch of surrogates [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1585.4s)]
*  that the Biden administration should deploy. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1587.8000000000002s)]
*  You didn't mention former President Obama. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1590.44s)]
*  And I'm just curious why not. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1593.0s)]
*  If you think he is a good surrogate for Biden. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1595.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1599.64s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1600.8400000000001s)]
*  It don't feel like he's on the front lines. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1602.28s)]
*  It don't feel like he's in active duty. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1604.44s)]
*  Like all of those other people, their gun is warm right now. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1606.92s)]
*  It feels like his gun is on safety, locked up in a vault somewhere. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1609.4s)]
*  You know, not saying that he can't come out and get it cracking. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1614.28s)]
*  But I just don't... [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1617.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1619.64s)]
*  He just don't... [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  Does it what? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1621.72s)]
*  Feel relevant? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1622.2s)]
*  I guess I can't say relevant, right? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1623.24s)]
*  He's President Barack Obama. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1624.84s)]
*  He's always... [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what I was about to say. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1626.52s)]
*  He can't say relevant. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1627.0s)]
*  He just don't... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1627.8s)]
*  He don't feel like he's of this moment. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1628.6s)]
*  And maybe that's his own doing. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1633.56s)]
*  I don't know what he could say that's going to really move people in 2024. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1636.12s)]
*  I mean, don't get me wrong. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1641.8s)]
*  He's one of the best speakers of all time. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1642.52s)]
*  Like, but I just don't know what he could say in this moment [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1645.0s)]
*  that's going to move people. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1648.1999999999998s)]
*  Because a lot of people, I remember when... [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1649.72s)]
*  I remember when he came out and he put out a tweet about Roe v. Wade [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1651.32s)]
*  after Roe v. Wade was overturned. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1654.36s)]
*  And a lot of people got on him and they was like, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1657.1599999999999s)]
*  yo, this is your fault. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1658.84s)]
*  You had an opportunity to codify Roe v. Wade when you were in the White House. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1659.96s)]
*  So don't come out shaking your finger at us now. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1664.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1666.52s)]
*  Like, I saw the backlash to that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1667.08s)]
*  And by the way, he could do whatever he wanted. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1670.28s)]
*  He's the former President of Barack Obama. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1671.48s)]
*  Instead of talking to the American people, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1672.76s)]
*  I think that what he's doing, from what I've heard behind the scenes, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1673.96s)]
*  pushing the Biden administration, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1676.84s)]
*  lighten the fire up under their ass, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1678.92s)]
*  telling them they need to have a sense of urgency. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1680.68s)]
*  Hey, y'all may lose this election in 2024. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1683.08s)]
*  If y'all don't pivot here and pivot there, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1686.12s)]
*  I think that's where he's probably most suited. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1688.12s)]
*  This is my last question for now. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1690.28s)]
*  Are you optimistic about where this country's going? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1693.32s)]
*  Depends, right? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1702.92s)]
*  Because when you say country, there's different... [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1704.04s)]
*  When you say country, there's different... [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1706.52s)]
*  There's a lot of different parts to that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1708.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm optimistic because I have to be. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1711.48s)]
*  Because I grew up poor and disenfranchised on a dirt road [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1713.88s)]
*  in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1717.3200000000002s)]
*  I grew up in a single-wide trailer. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1718.8400000000001s)]
*  So it's like, I have no choice but to be optimistic as a black man in America. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1721.0800000000002s)]
*  Because I've seen the worst of the worst. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1726.1200000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be sitting here with you, having a conversation with you, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  if I didn't have a case for optimism. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  But man, what scares me the most is that you have all of the so-called smart people [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1736.84s)]
*  being dumb. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  And I really think it's because of social media. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1746.9199999999998s)]
*  I think social media is ruining us. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1749.0s)]
*  And I think that it's only going to get worse [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1750.76s)]
*  because people don't know what's real and they don't know what's not real now. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1753.1599999999999s)]
*  I feel like, you know, that's what they do with me. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1757.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, they can literally take a clip of something I said and say, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1759.48s)]
*  look, he's supporting, you know, Donald Trump. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1763.56s)]
*  Or they can take this clip and say, look, he's supporting Biden. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1766.84s)]
*  It's like, no, I'm just having objective, nuanced conversation. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1769.8s)]
*  And what scares me is that, like, somebody's going to watch this whole New York, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1772.44s)]
*  listen to this whole New York Times interview, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1776.6s)]
*  and people are going to take what they want from it to push their narrative. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1779.0s)]
*  How does that help people? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1784.04s)]
*  It makes us not even want to try to see things from a different way [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1785.96s)]
*  because we don't want the words that are coming out of our mouth to be misconstrued. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1788.76s)]
*  So when you ask me, am I optimistic? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  I have no choice but to be because I believe in a higher power. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1795.56s)]
*  I believe in God. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1798.52s)]
*  But man, the way things are going right now, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that we're doing a great job of letting a would-be dictator back into the White House. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1803.0s)]
*  Charlemagne, we're going to talk later this week. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1812.6s)]
*  And I'm really looking forward to it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1815.1599999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1816.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1817.1599999999999s)]
*  After the break, I follow up with Charlemagne about how he feels let down by the Democrats, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1817.8s)]
*  and why those polls about Black voters really drive him crazy. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1824.76s)]
*  They're not going to blame this on Black men. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1829.24s)]
*  I see where this narrative is going, and I don't like it. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1831.1599999999999s)]
*  Charlemagne. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1848.76s)]
*  Please. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1850.2s)]
*  It's Lulu? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1850.84s)]
*  It is. It's Lulu. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1851.6399999999999s)]
*  What's up, Lulu? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1852.6s)]
*  Charlemagne, I've been thinking about something you said earlier. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1855.1599999999999s)]
*  We talked a lot about Democrats' bad messaging, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1859.48s)]
*  but not a lot about the substance of the Biden administration's policies. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1861.6399999999999s)]
*  What was it that you didn't get from them that you wanted to get? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1865.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh man, personally, just for me, I just think there's a lot of things that they could have been [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1870.12s)]
*  way stronger on, because they told us, vote for President Biden, get him in the White House. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1875.48s)]
*  Then they said, they pushed in Georgia to get these Senate seats, because they can get the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1881.32s)]
*  number of seats they need, and they can really make things happen. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1888.28s)]
*  And Vice President Kamala Harris will have the tiebreaker. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1891.16s)]
*  But man, it's like they volunteer those lies, right? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1893.88s)]
*  Because they know the politics of their senators, like Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1897.08s)]
*  They know the politics of them better than we the people do. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1902.04s)]
*  So they knew that there was a lot of these things that they wouldn't be able to make happen, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1905.48s)]
*  like the George Floyd Policing Act, like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1909.8s)]
*  They knew these things weren't going to happen. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1914.28s)]
*  We can keep saying things like, well, it's Congress's fault. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1917.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1920.52s)]
*  You're right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1922.44s)]
*  But guess who's the president of the United States of America? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1923.08s)]
*  That person gets the credit. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  What you saw recently with this so-called uptick that's supposed to happen with black votes in [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1927.56s)]
*  Trump, like I said, I think that's overstated. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1933.64s)]
*  But I do think there are three tangible things people point to in regard to President Trump. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1936.04s)]
*  And one is those stimulus checks. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1942.44s)]
*  Another is those PPP loans. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1945.16s)]
*  And another is the First Step Act. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1947.24s)]
*  And the reason those three things resonate with people is because folks actually got [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1948.92s)]
*  money in their pocket, but they're not looking as to why. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1953.96s)]
*  It's sadly because you had to go through something like COVID. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1957.08s)]
*  So you don't want millions of people to have to die for you to get a stimulus check [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1959.48s)]
*  or for you to get a PPP loan. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1963.0s)]
*  And then the First Step Act, there's people who actually saw family members and people [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1964.52s)]
*  they love actually get out of prison. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1969.16s)]
*  And he takes the credit for it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1971.72s)]
*  But isn't there something bigger going on? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1975.24s)]
*  Because I recently heard you interview Ray J. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1976.8400000000001s)]
*  And he said, in his world, at least, you can't get canceled for supporting Trump anymore. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1980.92s)]
*  I'm going to quote it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1985.24s)]
*  He said, I guarantee you this, you can't get canceled if you say you're going to vote [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1985.88s)]
*  Donald Trump like you used to. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1989.32s)]
*  If you say that you are risking something. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1990.68s)]
*  Now it's like I'm voting for him too. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1992.28s)]
*  I mean, we'll see. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1995.48s)]
*  I can't say just because Ray J wants to vote for Trump. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1997.32s)]
*  That is a shit. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=1999.8s)]
*  And all black men. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2001.88s)]
*  Maybe I'm delusional. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2003.0s)]
*  And I just don't think that any, no one celebrity or any influencer or YouTuber [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  has that kind of power. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2009.88s)]
*  Maybe it's me. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2011.16s)]
*  Maybe I'm bugging. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2012.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe I need to take a step back and really look at all of this power and influence that [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2013.64s)]
*  y'all say these individuals have. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't see Ray J saying that, making me believe that 30% of all black men are going to come out [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2020.6000000000001s)]
*  and vote for Donald Trump. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2026.68s)]
*  Do I think it's going to be an uptick? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2027.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2029.0s)]
*  I just don't think the numbers will be like that. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2029.5600000000002s)]
*  And to be clear, Ray J didn't say he was going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2033.0800000000002s)]
*  Let's also be clear. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2036.92s)]
*  That's not what he said. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2037.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. He just said that it's cool not to say it for Trump. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2038.6s)]
*  This is the other thing I don't want to. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2041.7199999999998s)]
*  They're not going to blame this on black men. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2043.32s)]
*  They're not going to do that. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2045.9599999999998s)]
*  I already see where this is going. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2047.32s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2050.52s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2051.72s)]
*  In 2016, when Hillary Clinton ran for president, black women showed up like they always do. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2053.3199999999997s)]
*  Our second highest base was us, black men. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2058.6s)]
*  When it comes to Donald Trump, those white suburban women elected him in 2016. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2061.56s)]
*  And 2020, a lot of them were right there too. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2068.2s)]
*  They're not about to blame this on black men. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2072.6s)]
*  No. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2076.2799999999997s)]
*  I see where this narrative is going and I don't like it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I guess people find the shift, if shift it is, surprising because I guess they're wondering [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2080.68s)]
*  why isn't the racism a deal breaker? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2088.52s)]
*  Or is that an unfair assumption to make about black voters? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2091.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, I can't speak for all black voters. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2095.56s)]
*  What I will say, they said Lyndon B. Johnson was a racist. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2097.7999999999997s)]
*  But I mean, look at the things that Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2100.44s)]
*  and the different civil rights movements at that time were able to push Lyndon B. Johnson to do. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2103.24s)]
*  I mean, when you bring up President Biden, you cannot bring up President Biden without [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2108.2799999999997s)]
*  talking about the 80s mandatory minimum sentence and 88 crack laws and the 94 crime bill. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2112.44s)]
*  And I remember if people go back and watch my conversation with Joe Biden on reference club, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2117.24s)]
*  I said to him, the 94 crime bill led to mass incarceration. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2121.48s)]
*  He goes, no, it was mandatory minimum sentence. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2124.76s)]
*  And I go, yeah, and you were behind that one too. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2126.76s)]
*  So it's like we know all of these things, but we still vote because we have to vote [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2130.44s)]
*  for our best interests. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2137.56s)]
*  We have to vote for the people that we feel like we can move. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2139.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to bring it back to you because you have found yourself in this position [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2142.52s)]
*  where you have a lot of influence, I would say a lot of power. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2151.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm wondering how you feel about that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2157.0s)]
*  How far does it reach? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2160.6s)]
*  Where do you want it to go? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2161.96s)]
*  I can promise you I am not sitting around thinking about that. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2165.8s)]
*  I can promise you I am not sitting around thinking about how much power I got. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2169.32s)]
*  No, I know that. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2174.04s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2175.0s)]
*  But I just wonder like- [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2175.96s)]
*  Like that kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit like, I'm not even thinking about that. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  I say it all the time. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2182.28s)]
*  I'm just a person who has a ticket to a show who gets to go talk to the artist after the show. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2183.08s)]
*  So I'm watching the same thing that everybody else is watching. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2190.92s)]
*  I'm in tune with the same thing that everybody else is in tune with. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't get to sit down and have a conversation with these people when the show is over. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2196.6s)]
*  And that's literally how I always approach it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2200.8399999999997s)]
*  I just always approach it from a place of curiosity. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2203.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmLIuX-rrl8&t=2206.2s)]
