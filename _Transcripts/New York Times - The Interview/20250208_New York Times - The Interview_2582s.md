# Denzel Washington Has Finally Found His Purpose
**New York Times - The Interview:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU)
*  From the New York Times, this is the Interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=0.0s)]
*  So many of Denzel Washington's greatest performances have been defined by a riveting sense of authority, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=10.0s)]
*  an absence of any pandering or need to be liked. There's something deep down inside [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=15.46s)]
*  his characters that feels unassailable, a little enigmatic, and theirs alone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=19.48s)]
*  The same steely qualities that have helped Washington become a legend, also, as I learned [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=24.52s)]
*  firsthand, make for an unusual and unusually complicated conversationalist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=29.92s)]
*  The first of our two discussions was done remotely. He was at a photo studio in Los [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=35.84s)]
*  Angeles as the fires were still raging there, and I was home in New Jersey. This discussion [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=39.56s)]
*  felt as if it were being conducted entirely on his terms. Or let me put it like this, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=44.96s)]
*  I didn't feel like we ever quite figured out how to connect. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  The second time we talked, a little over a week later, things were different. I met him [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  in person at a space in Manhattan where he was rehearsing for a rare Broadway appearance. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=58.8s)]
*  He's playing Othello in a new production that co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Iago and is directed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  by the Tony Award winner Kenny Leon. I can't really say why with any certainty, but things [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=68.56s)]
*  just felt easier with him this time. What I do know, though, is that after it was all [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=73.92s)]
*  over, I was left with an experience just as memorable as one of his performances. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=78.48s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Denzel Washington. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=84.56s)]
*  Hello, I'm David. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=91.92s)]
*  How are you, David Denzel? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=93.36s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=94.88s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=95.84s)]
*  Just to start, I saw that right at the end of last year. You were baptized and earned [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=97.36s)]
*  your minister's license? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=103.12s)]
*  I got baptized and I have to now take courses to obtain a license, but I did get baptized, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  but I'm not an ordained minister. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=114.88s)]
*  Can you tell me about the decision to go through that process at this point in your life? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  I went for a ride one day and I decided to go up to Harlem. I was in Manhattan. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=123.36s)]
*  I decided to get my car and drive up to Harlem and riding around, think of the places where [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=133.6s)]
*  my mother lived. And I stopped in front of the church that my mother grew up in and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=138.64s)]
*  door was cracked. So I went in and they were celebrating the young students, members of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=145.44s)]
*  church that were going to college. And I got involved in that and one thing led to another. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=153.68s)]
*  Whatever it was, weeks later, months later, I got baptized. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=159.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=161.76s)]
*  Your father was a preacher, is that right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=162.88s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=164.72s)]
*  Do you feel like you're sort of following in a family tradition in some sense or connecting with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=166.32s)]
*  him? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=170.72s)]
*  It was prophesied in my youth that I would travel the world and preach or speak to millions of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=173.28s)]
*  people. I used to think that I was doing that through my work. Now I'm trying to be a bit more [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  specific about speaking about my faith. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=189.44s)]
*  I've seen you refer to the prophecy. Can you tell folks the story? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=194.16s)]
*  Well, a woman was sitting in my mother's beauty shop in March 1975. The reason I was in there was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=199.6s)]
*  because I had flunked out of college. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=207.12s)]
*  This is Mount Vernon, New York, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=208.56s)]
*  Yeah. I was up in Mount Vernon and I was told to take a semester off from school [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=210.32s)]
*  to think about what I wanted to do. And every time I looked up in the mirror, I saw this woman [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=216.0s)]
*  looking at me and she said she was having a prophecy. She said I would travel the world [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  and preach to millions of people. She didn't say anything about me being an actor or getting back [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=230.88s)]
*  in school, but I have traveled the world and I am speaking more and more. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=235.44s)]
*  But was your gift for acting and the career that you've had, do you feel like any sort of message [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=243.6s)]
*  was being delivered through that or was acting totally, you know, did it turn out that it was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=250.72s)]
*  totally separate from the- [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=256.0s)]
*  No, I wouldn't say it's either or. You know, I don't separate one nor do I categorize, but it's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=257.36s)]
*  definitely given me the platform to speak. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=265.52s)]
*  Do you think there might come a time when you move to speaking mostly through ministry and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  not through acting? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=275.44s)]
*  No. I don't know. I don't know. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=276.24s)]
*  And you know, this is just a bit of a shot in the dark that it's based on just some reading I was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  doing that I think, you know, sparked some connections for me. But I was just reading, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=284.64s)]
*  there's a book by James Baldwin called The Devil Finds Work. And in there, he makes connections [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=290.08s)]
*  between the church and theater. Does that comparison ring true for you? Do you see [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=294.96s)]
*  similarities between the church and theater? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=302.24s)]
*  The universal stems from the specifics. So you got to be more specific. In what way? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=309.36s)]
*  He says, you know, both are about people sort of experiencing an event together, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=316.24s)]
*  communally creating the event as it happens, when all these people are together in the moment, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=320.88s)]
*  experiencing the same thing. It sounds like James Baldwin is saying there is an energy and, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=328.56s)]
*  you know, sort of a spirit that is created that for him was sort of similar between the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=335.28s)]
*  church and the theater. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=340.08s)]
*  I can agree with that. I agree with that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=341.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=343.84s)]
*  Yeah. The reason, of course, I ask about theater is because you're going back to the theater to do [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=344.34s)]
*  Othello. Can you tell me about the rewards for you of doing Shakespeare? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  It's 48 years between I played Othello at 22. And I'm going back at 70. So the challenge of that, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  I love the theater. I started in the theater. I learned to act on stage. And as an actor, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=370.5s)]
*  I think that still gives me the greatest joy is acting on stage as opposed to acting in movies. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=377.86s)]
*  That's a thing that I've heard actors say a fair bit that there is an energy or a joy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  that comes from doing theatrical work. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=392.42s)]
*  And immediacy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=394.18s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm wondering if you can help someone like me who has no experience [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=395.22s)]
*  acting understand sort of the emotional difference of performing in the different mediums. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  Film is a director's medium. No matter what you do as an actor, the director slash editor decides [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=404.66s)]
*  whether it's in the movie or not. Theater is an actor's medium. Once the curtain goes up, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=412.26000000000005s)]
*  it's between us and the audience. And they tell you how they feel that night. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=418.74s)]
*  You've been acting for a pretty long time now. How has your relationship to acting changed? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=427.54s)]
*  The lines are more frightening now. I'd like to think I know a lot more at 70 years old than I [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  knew at 22. And enjoy the ride. I appreciate it more, that's for sure. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=444.74s)]
*  What do you appreciate about it? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=454.42s)]
*  Just being alive. That alone. Somebody said, considering how long you're dead, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=455.94s)]
*  you're here a relatively short period of time. So for me, that means take full advantage of it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=470.34s)]
*  I was wondering, I also watched the commencement speech you gave at Penn. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  It was probably, I don't know, 10 years ago, something like that. And you talked to the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=486.34s)]
*  students about the necessity of you have to be willing to fail, which is another way of saying [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=490.9s)]
*  you have to be willing to take risks. And are there ways in which doing a fellow or even just [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=496.66s)]
*  doing theater feels like a risk for you? In light of all that's going on in our world, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=503.3s)]
*  in light of all that's going on in our state, California, in our city specifically, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  it's just a play. I'm grateful for the opportunity, but [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  when put in perspective, it's just a play. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  What has your experience been with the fires out there? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=528.66s)]
*  No, just as a spectator and just being amazed, first of all, just the scope and size and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=534.82s)]
*  devastation. And then hearing all about a lot of people in our industry who've been affected, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  you know, Pacific balisades and just unbelievable and just unbelievable. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=550.74s)]
*  I mean, it's going to change that city for decades. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=558.98s)]
*  Yeah, it has changed the city already. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=561.38s)]
*  How so? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=564.1s)]
*  Well, it just will never be the same. You know, the scars, the stories, the testimonies that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=564.9s)]
*  thousands of people have now, the loss of life and of property and memories. And [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=571.94s)]
*  it is an equal opportunity destroyer from riches to poorest. It's a sad thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=581.78s)]
*  Does it make you want to live somewhere else? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=590.9s)]
*  What do you mean, live somewhere else? What do you mean, like run? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=593.38s)]
*  Well, it's just the reality of the danger in California is scary. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=595.62s)]
*  No, it doesn't make me want to live somewhere else. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=604.74s)]
*  Let me shift gears for a second. I want to ask you about family. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  Did having children change your perspective on the work at all? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=614.5s)]
*  Yeah, it changed my perspective. Like, shoot, they got to go where to school? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  It cost how much? How much to close costs? Yeah, it changed everything. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=622.9s)]
*  A thing I'm always curious about with actors is and just artists generally is when they realize [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=628.42s)]
*  it is also a business and a money making enterprise. And, you know, it's not just this pure thing [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=634.9s)]
*  where you follow your artistic bliss all the time. And that's sort of what you're describing a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  little bit like you at some point you thought, well, these are I got to take money making jobs. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  Does that affect how you approach the work itself? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=649.14s)]
*  When I learned about my favorite uncle, my least favorite uncle, my Uncle Sam, that was the eye [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  opener. I'm like, what? He takes what? You mean from go? He gets how much? What did he do? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=659.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, that's the reality of it. And a dollar is not a dollar. It's about 40 cents. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  Time, you, agents, lawyer, business manager, Uncle Sam, everybody else gets finished with you. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=676.4200000000001s)]
*  The dollar is about 38 cents. And that's what it is. So you got to cobble those 38 cents together [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=681.94s)]
*  to make a dollar, a real dollar. But does it affect the work? Like, if you know that something is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=688.4200000000001s)]
*  a money job, basically, do you go about doing that job any different? If you're asking me, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=695.94s)]
*  did I ever take a job for money? No, no, I'm asking because I was about to answer it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=700.82s)]
*  I've taken every job for money. There's no job I've taken where I went, you know what, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=706.74s)]
*  you guys just keep the money. I'm just so happy. I'm just so glad to be an actor. I don't even want [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=712.1800000000001s)]
*  the money. My kids will work it out. They'll, we'll, we'll homeschool them. You're breaking [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=718.98s)]
*  my heart. I think you're, there's got to be a difference in the calculus. When you say yes to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=723.86s)]
*  Mississippi Masala or even Malcolm X as opposed to Virtuosity or Ricochet, Action Movies. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=732.02s)]
*  Yeah, probably. Especially Virtuosity. That was, I had some bills to pay. Ricochet was more like [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=742.34s)]
*  venturing down that road for the first time. The Action Movie Road. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The Action Movie Road, which I didn't really know. Virtuosity had definitely had [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=753.62s)]
*  something to do with tuition. I'm sure. You know, going back to the subject of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=758.74s)]
*  your children, they all work in the business, right? Was that something that you felt like you had to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=768.34s)]
*  navigate with them or talk with them? I mean, I imagine they got jobs before they, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=776.26s)]
*  before I knew they were in the business. John David was reading for ballers and I didn't even [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=780.98s)]
*  know about it because he was working with his mom. Pauletta didn't tell me. So he got the job [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=785.3s)]
*  before I knew about it. Why didn't they tell you? Because I probably would have told everybody or [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=791.62s)]
*  blown it or done something because I talked too much. Your wife, Pauletta, is an actress. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes. And singer and concert pianist, child prodigy. Van Cliburn. You're familiar with the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=805.38s)]
*  Van Cliburn competition? Yeah. The piano competition. Yeah. My wife was a Van Cliburn [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=811.46s)]
*  competitor. Juilliard, North Carolina School of the Arts, the whole, I married up. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=816.02s)]
*  What have you learned about being an artist from her? That it's an art. You know, that it's an art. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=823.46s)]
*  Acting just sort of chose me and I got going and all good, but she's an artist. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=832.02s)]
*  I never looked at myself that way. And I just learned a lot about the discipline of it, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=840.02s)]
*  the appreciation of it from her. So do you still not look at yourself as an artist? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=847.54s)]
*  I try not to look at myself, period. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=855.06s)]
*  You know, look at myself as a what? I got no time for that. I'm not much for reflection. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=859.38s)]
*  Can I ask you about the piece? I don't have any money. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=865.62s)]
*  That was my next question. Yeah, I know. Go ahead. You're going to ask me about what? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=872.02s)]
*  The first person piece you did for Esquire last year, sort of tied to Gladiator 2. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=878.26s)]
*  You know, you talked sort of almost like a memoiristic piece. You talked about your whole [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=886.9s)]
*  life and your career. And I think that was the first place, at least that I've seen, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=892.58s)]
*  where you really talked about drinking. And in there, you said there's this long period, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=897.3000000000001s)]
*  I think you pegged it as like 1999 to 2014. When you put the beverage down, you were bitter. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=903.46s)]
*  Bitter about what? I was bitter when I put it down or I was bitter when I picked it up. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=910.1s)]
*  I'd be interested to hear what you say now. I was probably bitter when I picked it up. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=914.5s)]
*  I wasn't bitter when I put it down. Yeah. But what were you bitter about? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=919.3s)]
*  Pick something. I don't know. Any excuse will do. And no excuse is good enough. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=925.46s)]
*  Do you feel like you have insight into sort of what the drinking was about? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=932.34s)]
*  Who commanded it? We don't have that much time, brother. Yeah, we don't have that much time. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=936.74s)]
*  Yeah. Is it right that you used to carry around your acceptance letter from the American [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  Conservatory Theater? No, I kept a letter from my English teacher. Oh, why was it something that [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=949.06s)]
*  you kept? He just wanted to get all in my business because it made me feel good. It was a letter of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=957.78s)]
*  recommendation. That's what it was. I'm just trying to fish around for things that might be [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=963.62s)]
*  engaging. I'm not trying to get all up in your business. But you are all up in my business, man. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=972.18s)]
*  Yeah. I apologize. And I don't like it, man. I'm just here to tell you. I'm joking. I'm joking. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=978.18s)]
*  Oh, thank God. That was a joke. He looked so serious. That was a joke. He was. I know how [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=984.74s)]
*  to get you now. You're easy. I'm too easy is the problem. Can I be honest with you? Go ahead. Sure. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=991.94s)]
*  I just want to be honest. I don't know where to go conversationally with you. I feel like I'm just [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=999.46s)]
*  jumping around and I'm not connecting. I don't know if there's a different- [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1005.86s)]
*  Would you like, maybe I should ask you a question? Sure. Why do you feel that way? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1011.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, can I give you two answers to that? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1017.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay. I'll have two answers. Yes. Well, the first answer is why I feel that way is because [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1022.74s)]
*  the answers have been short and often people are a little more expansive. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1028.02s)]
*  And I think- Okay. I'll give you an expansive answer. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1033.14s)]
*  Ask me a question and I'm going to give you an expansive answer. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1035.46s)]
*  Well, all right. So not too long ago, you finished filming a film with Spike Lee. Is that right? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1038.42s)]
*  Yes. That was your answer. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1049.38s)]
*  You tricked me again. No, I did finish one with Spike Lee. Good. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1054.9s)]
*  So, and I think it's your first time- Hi, hello. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1059.54s)]
*  Yes. Your first time working with him since Inside Man, which is almost 20 years ago. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1062.9s)]
*  How has your relationship with him changed over time? What was different about it? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1068.1000000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. Finally. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1074.2600000000002s)]
*  No, no, because I don't know that it didn't feel like 20 years. We had such great success [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1076.42s)]
*  20 years ago. I guess he kicked me to the curb and started working with my son. Actually, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  when I come to think of it. Maybe, yeah, he kicked me to the curb and started working with my son. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1090.2600000000002s)]
*  No, it felt like we picked up where we left off. I mean, Spike is Spike. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1096.18s)]
*  Meaning? Spike is consistent. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1106.02s)]
*  Lee Spike. I love that about him and I love working with him and I'd work with him again. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1109.46s)]
*  I just like the way his brain works. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1118.42s)]
*  Can I tell you the second reason why I'm having a hard time today? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1121.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1124.3400000000001s)]
*  I like to ask philosophical questions about why people do what they do and the meaning of it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1125.3s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1130.58s)]
*  I enjoy it. It seems like when I've asked you those types of questions, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1132.02s)]
*  it just hasn't seemed interesting to you. I think as a result, I feel like I've been flailing a [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1138.6599999999999s)]
*  little. I'd say, what about this? What about that? Well, here's your opportunity to get back [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1144.1s)]
*  on track with your next question. All right, I'll try again. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1150.58s)]
*  I'll try again. Okay. It's not going to work. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1155.3s)]
*  Yes, it will. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1157.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1158.34s)]
*  See, how are you going to say it's not going to work before you even try? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1158.5s)]
*  Okay, I'll try. I'll try. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1162.82s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1166.1s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1168.6599999999999s)]
*  Now you're just liking making me squirm. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1170.34s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1172.02s)]
*  That's fine. That's fine. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1173.06s)]
*  What's the question? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1174.82s)]
*  I'm always curious about the interplay between the life and the work. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1177.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1182.66s)]
*  And I just rewatched Flight, which that's my favorite performance of yours. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1183.22s)]
*  Yeah, in that one, you play an airline captain named Whip Whitaker who, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1191.3s)]
*  struggling with alcohol, managed to save a flight in semi-miraculous fashion. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1198.5s)]
*  The thing that I was thinking about in watching that one was how it fit in with your life at [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1204.66s)]
*  the time because it was in that timeline, I think, when you were drinking. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1210.1s)]
*  And I did wonder, did playing that character show you anything about your own situation or, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1214.4199999999998s)]
*  yeah, stop there. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1222.5s)]
*  Did it show me anything about my own situation? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1225.1399999999999s)]
*  Not that I recall. I mean, first of all, I didn't drink and work. Never have. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1229.6999999999998s)]
*  I'd work and then drink, like maybe when I'm finished the movie or whatever. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1233.86s)]
*  So I wasn't, honestly, I don't even remember whether I was drinking those evenings or not. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1238.74s)]
*  I don't really recall, to be honest with you. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1247.62s)]
*  But what was the question you said, did it affect? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1249.78s)]
*  But you said, did it what? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1251.7s)]
*  Yeah, did you learn anything about yourself from doing a role like that? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1252.5s)]
*  I think when you're in the middle of it, you're not so self-reflective because you're still [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1260.5s)]
*  working out the character. You haven't shot the last scene. You don't know how it ends, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1266.42s)]
*  in a sense, not making light of it, but not when you're in the middle of it so much. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1270.98s)]
*  I think that's with any character. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1277.3000000000002s)]
*  You're saying you sort of gained some understanding maybe after the fact, not when you're doing it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1280.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, if you're thinking about it, which I probably wasn't. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1285.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1291.78s)]
*  What kinds of things do you think I should ask? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1292.58s)]
*  Ask me? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1298.02s)]
*  Ask you. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1298.26s)]
*  I want to know more about you. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1298.82s)]
*  Okay, we can switch roles. I would love to do that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1301.62s)]
*  What do you need to work on more than anything else? If you said to yourself, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  I wish I was better at this, what would that be? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1311.54s)]
*  Aside from interviewing Denzel Washington? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1315.3s)]
*  No, come on, don't deflect. We're talking about you now. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1317.06s)]
*  I'll tell you. The thing that I need to work on more than anything else is I have an assertiveness [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1320.02s)]
*  problem and a problem with conflict. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1326.98s)]
*  You mean you're being assertive or you're too assertive? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1330.18s)]
*  With being assertive. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1332.8200000000002s)]
*  You're not assertive enough. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1333.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not assertive enough and I have a problem with conflict in a way that, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1335.6200000000001s)]
*  because I try and avoid it, the problems end up, rather than getting solved, they just linger. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1340.02s)]
*  And that had something to do with your dad or what? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1345.54s)]
*  Oh, see, I should be taking lessons from you. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1347.94s)]
*  Would you answer these types of questions if I asked you them? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1350.98s)]
*  Ask me. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1353.94s)]
*  What do you need to work on the most? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1354.98s)]
*  Hmm. Othello. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1357.6200000000001s)]
*  No, you're deflecting. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1361.14s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1362.1000000000001s)]
*  You said I can't deflect, so you don't deflect. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1362.58s)]
*  Okay, no, good point. I don't know. What do I need to work on the most? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1364.74s)]
*  Even my answer sounds like a deflection. I was going to mention my faith. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1373.06s)]
*  But that sounds like deflection. I don't know. Maybe that's a good thing. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1378.02s)]
*  I can't think of something I need to really work on. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1381.94s)]
*  I think that means, I mean, nobody's perfect. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe you're not. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1388.1000000000001s)]
*  I didn't say I was perfect. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1388.9s)]
*  Not thinking hard enough. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1390.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'm not thinking hard enough. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1391.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, relationships, you can always do better there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1393.46s)]
*  How? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1397.46s)]
*  Okay, I'm a talker, so I got to work on listening. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1400.26s)]
*  It doesn't feel like you're a talker. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1404.74s)]
*  I guess because I'm listening today. It's a role I'm playing. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1406.66s)]
*  Wait, ask me another one. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1413.14s)]
*  Tell me the second thing that you love, not the first thing. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1415.14s)]
*  The second thing you love the most. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1418.26s)]
*  Well, two things. Can I tell you two? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1420.3400000000001s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1422.9s)]
*  This is going to sound so corny. The second one's not as corny. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1424.66s)]
*  But the first one that came to mind was laughing. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1427.46s)]
*  Oh, that's a good thing. Great. That's a great thing. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1431.3000000000002s)]
*  And then the second thing is intellectual stimulation. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1434.5800000000002s)]
*  I hate being bored. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1439.06s)]
*  I like both of those answers. I'm running with that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1440.74s)]
*  Laughter and intellectual stimulation. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1443.78s)]
*  Stimulation. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1446.5s)]
*  Stimulation. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1447.54s)]
*  Stimulation. What'd I say? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1448.18s)]
*  Stimulation. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1449.22s)]
*  Stimulation. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1450.1000000000001s)]
*  Intellectual stimulation. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1451.3s)]
*  Obviously, I need more intellectual stimulation. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1454.66s)]
*  Okay, your turn. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1458.9s)]
*  The thing that what? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1460.26s)]
*  The thing you love second most, I think, was the question. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1462.02s)]
*  I think the opportunity to lift others up. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1466.1799999999998s)]
*  How have you done that? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1472.5s)]
*  Every opportunity and every which way I can. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1473.86s)]
*  Sometimes with a dime, sometimes with a dollar, sometimes with a good word. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  I love helping people. I love seeing people do well. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1482.1s)]
*  So any opportunity I get to do that is really selfish because it makes me feel good. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1486.9s)]
*  Can I do my version of the kinds of questions you've been asking me? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1494.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1498.8200000000002s)]
*  How do you think evil works in the world? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1499.7s)]
*  It's an opportunity for good to take advantage of it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1503.46s)]
*  Evil is short term. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1506.9s)]
*  Evil always has an end. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1508.74s)]
*  Evil's always revisited on the evil. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1511.46s)]
*  Period. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1516.1000000000001s)]
*  That's all I got to say about it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1517.8600000000001s)]
*  It's always revisited on the evil. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  Where do you think evil comes from? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1523.14s)]
*  We're the only animal on the planet that God has blessed with free will. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1525.78s)]
*  You don't believe me? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1532.18s)]
*  Run from a lion and see if the lion goes, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1533.14s)]
*  ah, I think he's a nice guy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1536.42s)]
*  That's good interviews. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1540.02s)]
*  We're going to let him live today. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1540.98s)]
*  Now, he's going to chase you down. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1542.18s)]
*  He's going to eat you. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1543.46s)]
*  The last question for this time. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1546.18s)]
*  What should I go away and think about in preparation for when we talk again? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1548.02s)]
*  Man goes down to the ocean [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  and tries to fit all the knowledge of the ocean into his little brain instead of just [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1560.3400000000001s)]
*  jumping in the water and enjoying himself. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1567.38s)]
*  Sometimes you just have to have faith in things bigger than our ability to understand them. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1572.02s)]
*  Now, you call it what you want. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1579.46s)]
*  Some call it God. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1580.82s)]
*  You call it what you want. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1582.4199999999998s)]
*  But sometimes you just have to jump in the water and enjoy yourself [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1585.1399999999999s)]
*  and not try to figure it out. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1588.8999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1591.78s)]
*  I think that is something for me to think about for next time. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1592.02s)]
*  For next time. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1596.58s)]
*  Bring your bathing suit. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1597.7s)]
*  We're jumping in the water together next time. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1598.6599999999999s)]
*  After the break, Denzel and I sit down in person and he digs a little deeper into this moment in his career. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1601.3s)]
*  Well, today you didn't get a nomination for an Oscar. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  You're working on Othello on Broadway. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1613.94s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1616.98s)]
*  Oh, I'm so upset. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1618.5s)]
*  Thank you for giving me another run of this. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1631.94s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1637.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1638.58s)]
*  And so we're in this rehearsal space where you're working on Othello. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1639.1399999999999s)]
*  How are the rehearsals going so far? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1644.74s)]
*  It's going well. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1646.4199999999998s)]
*  In fact, we have our first day today, which is day four of rehearsal, where we'll start [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1647.7s)]
*  to just starting to stand it up on his feet. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1653.54s)]
*  Just starting today will be the first day of blocking. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1656.1s)]
*  And how much of our conversation from last week do you remember? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1660.0200000000002s)]
*  Do you remember any? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1663.94s)]
*  None. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1664.66s)]
*  None. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1665.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1665.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1666.16s)]
*  Good. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1666.66s)]
*  So that's helpful for me because I really felt like I was flailing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1667.16s)]
*  But at the end of our conversation, I had asked you if there was anything that maybe [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1671.5400000000002s)]
*  I could reflect on before we spoke again. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1676.3400000000001s)]
*  And you told me this little very short little parable about a man standing at the edge of the water. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1678.8200000000002s)]
*  Man goes down to the ocean. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1685.06s)]
*  I forgot where I got that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1688.26s)]
*  Might have been some yogi. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1689.14s)]
*  I don't know where I got it from. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1691.46s)]
*  But the way I interpret it over the years, the way I've come to understand it is that [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1692.98s)]
*  jumping in the water is faith. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1698.66s)]
*  Just jumping. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1701.46s)]
*  You can't figure it all out. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1703.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1705.94s)]
*  But the way I was thinking about that parable was that I felt like in our first conversation, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1706.58s)]
*  I was too stuck in my own head, wrapped up in expectations of how the conversation [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1712.82s)]
*  was supposed to go rather than just being with you in the moment, you know, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1718.82s)]
*  and sort of meeting you where you were. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1722.4199999999998s)]
*  But my question also is where did you learn that lesson [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1725.3799999999999s)]
*  that sometimes you just got to jump in the water rather than think about the water? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1729.86s)]
*  Well, I've tried everything else. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1734.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I've tried everything else. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1738.74s)]
*  You know, I was reading Matthew today, and it talks about the mustard seed and if you [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1740.34s)]
*  put it in rocky soil, it won't grow and all those things. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1748.34s)]
*  And it talks about faith, you know, that you have to have faith that it will grow. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1752.1s)]
*  And it talked about this. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1758.9s)]
*  You can't even figure out how it grows, or why it grows, or where the sun comes from. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1760.1s)]
*  Man goes down. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1764.82s)]
*  Here's what I mean. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1767.54s)]
*  Man tries to reduce everything down to his understanding, which is the ultimate in ego, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1768.66s)]
*  which is if I don't understand it, it doesn't exist. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1774.66s)]
*  So people don't understand God. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1777.22s)]
*  So some say therefore he doesn't exist, or they say I'm God, because that's what they need. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1778.9s)]
*  Well, I'm like, well, how's that working out? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1784.1000000000001s)]
*  If that works for you, okay. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1787.22s)]
*  I was watching something interesting last night. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1791.38s)]
*  I'm jumping all over the place. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1792.9s)]
*  Yeah, go for it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1793.78s)]
*  I'll give you the next one. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1794.5s)]
*  Sorry, going better the last time. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1795.14s)]
*  I was watching this thing about Herod. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1796.1s)]
*  Man. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1798.82s)]
*  Oh, King Herod. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1799.54s)]
*  Oh, so this long special. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1800.26s)]
*  I was like, man, he was a mess. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1802.02s)]
*  He thought he could think his way to heaven. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1805.2199999999998s)]
*  So he kept building things on higher and higher places, and he's going to be up here looking down [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1808.4199999999998s)]
*  on everybody. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1813.86s)]
*  And obviously he was a genius, but I guess he died in the worst way. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1814.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1817.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1818.58s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1818.82s)]
*  You know, you also spoke last time about the value for you of helping people. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1819.6200000000001s)]
*  Does acting help people? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  At this point, everything I'm doing is through the lens of what God thinks. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1829.14s)]
*  Not what they think. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1833.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what they think. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1835.22s)]
*  That's a whole, you go down that hole, you'll never come out of that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1839.3000000000002s)]
*  I hope they enjoy the show, but I can't. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1844.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what you need. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1847.5400000000002s)]
*  I can't, you know, and we don't do a poll before the screening or before the play starts. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1848.9s)]
*  It's some interesting themes. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1855.7s)]
*  In S.L.O. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1857.14s)]
*  Jealousy and envy and pain and death and Kenny, good, brilliant director. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1858.18s)]
*  He's putting in what he calls the near future. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1865.3000000000002s)]
*  So it's now, let's say, near now. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1866.98s)]
*  So all of those things, jealousy, envy, all of that, it takes on a whole new thing. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  With the information age. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1877.22s)]
*  What's your favorite line from Othello? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1880.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1882.34s)]
*  I got two, you want to hear them? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1883.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1884.6599999999999s)]
*  First is Othello. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1885.1399999999999s)]
*  Are they from him? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1886.1s)]
*  One's from Othello, one's Iago. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1887.46s)]
*  Othello is who can control his fate. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1890.1s)]
*  And then my favorite line of all of Shakespeare is Iago's line, I am not what I am. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1894.1799999999998s)]
*  I am not what I am. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1899.6999999999998s)]
*  He said it yesterday. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1900.4199999999998s)]
*  He's a complicated guy. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1902.34s)]
*  He's going to be brilliant in this. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1903.54s)]
*  Jake Gyllenhaal is playing in the audio. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1904.98s)]
*  He's nuts. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1907.7s)]
*  I love him. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1908.74s)]
*  He's complicated. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1911.06s)]
*  But he's already got a handle on it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1913.22s)]
*  I can see how far ahead people are. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1917.78s)]
*  I'm not worried about that because I don't like to learn the lines too soon. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1920.58s)]
*  I was telling a young actor, why don't you like to learn them too soon? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1924.58s)]
*  I said because then I'm the voice I'm listening to delivering the cues to myself. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1928.5s)]
*  I want to hear it from you and that's going to affect how I say what I say. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  For me that works. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1939.5400000000002s)]
*  And to be quite honest, because I played it before, I still kind of remember it, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1940.42s)]
*  but it's not word for word. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1947.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm seeing where I miss a word here, word there. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1948.3400000000001s)]
*  I learned the first scene last night in about an hour and a half. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1952.3400000000001s)]
*  I ran a little bit with the kid this morning before I saw you. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1955.94s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I'll be all right. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1959.14s)]
*  You just said Jake Gyllenhaal was complicated. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1961.54s)]
*  Do you think... [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1964.02s)]
*  In a good way. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1964.82s)]
*  In a good way. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1965.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, in a great way. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1965.9399999999998s)]
*  Are you complicated? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1967.3s)]
*  I'm sure, yeah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1968.34s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1969.1399999999999s)]
*  Trying to thin the herd, keep it simple. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1970.74s)]
*  My mother used to say that, keep it simple. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1973.1399999999999s)]
*  That's hard to do. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1975.3s)]
*  I'd like to tell you that this morning I woke up and started thinking about God. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1976.58s)]
*  I woke up and started thinking about Othello. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1979.54s)]
*  But then I said, but that's okay. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1982.5s)]
*  You're excited. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1984.02s)]
*  You know, it's an interesting [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1985.7s)]
*  place for me to visit now. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1990.4199999999998s)]
*  48 years after I visited it, the first time on the way to work, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1993.86s)]
*  we were going down 9th Avenue and we passed Fordham University. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=1998.6599999999999s)]
*  And I said, the first day of rehearsal, Tuesday, I said, wow, 48 years ago, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2004.1799999999998s)]
*  I was doing Othello right there at 22. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2007.78s)]
*  And now I'm heading over here to 40, whatever it is, 5th Street, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2011.14s)]
*  to do Othello again. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2016.26s)]
*  Ain't life interesting. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2017.3000000000002s)]
*  And I'm only two blocks away from where we live now, which is, you know, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2019.38s)]
*  and we overlook the park. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2025.0600000000002s)]
*  My wife, I remember saying to my mother, I said, wow, you know, all these years, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2028.8200000000002s)]
*  I only moved two blocks. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2033.7s)]
*  She said, yeah, but you went up 14 stories as only a mother. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2035.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2039.46s)]
*  You know, you said everything now is kind of about seeing it through the lens of [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2040.6000000000001s)]
*  what God thinks. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2045.24s)]
*  Or at least through the lens of faith. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2047.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2048.28s)]
*  How does acting fit into that? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2048.68s)]
*  That's why you pray every day. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2050.76s)]
*  I'm like, okay, Lord, I'm here. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2053.32s)]
*  I think this is what you wanted me to do. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2055.32s)]
*  Now, I'm not sure why, you know, but one can say coincidence and serendipity [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2056.6s)]
*  and all those things. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2063.8s)]
*  I bit my tongue almost half off about a few months ago and it's affecting my speech. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2065.32s)]
*  It forces me to slow down. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2074.84s)]
*  You know, as they say, bite your tongue. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2078.04s)]
*  Othello says, rude am I in my speech. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2080.1200000000003s)]
*  I said, you mean I bit my tongue so I can bear for it? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2084.04s)]
*  Well, the fact of the matter is that is what it is and I got to go forward with it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2088.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2093.48s)]
*  I have to use it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2093.8s)]
*  I have a line. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm just starting to learn it. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2098.6800000000003s)]
*  Where the will you that I go to answer this your charge? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  Where the will you that? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2102.6800000000003s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2104.52s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2105.2400000000002s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2105.88s)]
*  See, hard if your tongue is fine. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2106.36s)]
*  Yeah, my tongue is sore and I got some temporary tooth put in [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2107.7200000000003s)]
*  because my tooth fell out of my head. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2111.0s)]
*  So everything is thicker. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2112.76s)]
*  It's affected everything and I'm thinking that's a bad thing. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2114.36s)]
*  So I don't think it's ever going to heal. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2117.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like I got a little flap in there now. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2119.0800000000004s)]
*  But you just got to use it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2121.5600000000004s)]
*  Jump in the water and enjoy yourself instead of worrying about drowning. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2124.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  I've really been thinking a lot lately about David Lynch who just died. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2130.92s)]
*  David Lynch. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2137.64s)]
*  A movie, man. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2139.0s)]
*  That was a great movie. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2141.16s)]
*  But I loved it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2142.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2143.4s)]
*  I was like this guy's nuts. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2143.64s)]
*  But the thing that one of the reasons I mean I loved his movies, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  but one of the reasons that he was really meaningful to me and why I've been [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2150.84s)]
*  thinking about him so much is that probably about 15 or so years ago, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2154.36s)]
*  maybe in a little long, I was really low, just really struggling. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2158.6000000000004s)]
*  And I thought I got to change something. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2162.92s)]
*  My life can't go on like this. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2165.32s)]
*  And because I liked his movies, I saw that it was in a bookstore [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2166.92s)]
*  and I saw that David Lynch had this book called Catching the Big Fish. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2171.08s)]
*  It was about creativity. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2174.28s)]
*  And in there he has a bit where he's talking about why he meditates. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2175.88s)]
*  He said one of the benefits of meditation is that it helps you become more you. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2180.44s)]
*  And then I started meditating about 15 or so years ago, maybe even longer, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2185.4s)]
*  and it's completely changed my life. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2189.32s)]
*  Just seeing that one little sentence in that one book I picked up one day by David Lynch, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2191.32s)]
*  changed my life. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2195.96s)]
*  Have you ever had an experience like that where just some, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2197.4s)]
*  from afar, someone changed your life? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2200.76s)]
*  Prophecy changed my life completely. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2202.84s)]
*  Now, I wasn't ready. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2205.4s)]
*  Going back to Matthew, it must have been seed planted in, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2206.6s)]
*  I forgot, there's rocky soil and there's the other one where [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2213.24s)]
*  it talks about the cares of the world coming and taking away from you. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2216.6s)]
*  So she planted the seed, but I wasn't ready for it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2222.2s)]
*  Or I didn't understand it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2227.24s)]
*  It's been a 50-year journey from then. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2228.68s)]
*  I was 20 then, I'm 70 now. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2231.56s)]
*  I'm on that 50-year journey to understanding. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2233.88s)]
*  Did an artist ever change your life? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2237.88s)]
*  An artist? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2239.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2240.52s)]
*  So my English teacher, Bob Stone, who was in a fellow with Paul Robeson, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2241.88s)]
*  Robinson Stone, you can look him up, he wrote a recommendation letter for me [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2248.04s)]
*  for the American Conservatory Theater, which I still have. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2252.6s)]
*  And what he wrote was just so, he basically said to them, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2256.92s)]
*  if you don't have the ability to give this young talent what he needs, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  then don't accept him. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2267.72s)]
*  Which was like, wow. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2269.48s)]
*  It's like reverse psychology. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2271.24s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2272.36s)]
*  But yeah, that he was artistically, especially early on, the most important [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2274.04s)]
*  person because he had been there, he understood the game. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2284.12s)]
*  He helped me get introduced, me the first agents and all that while I was still in college. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2287.56s)]
*  You know, then isn't the funny twist of that story that [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2293.88s)]
*  didn't you drop out of ACT after a couple months? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2296.44s)]
*  No, I stayed for a year. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2298.84s)]
*  For a year, okay. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2300.36s)]
*  Politics. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2301.24s)]
*  I could see what was going on and I already... [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2302.68s)]
*  Wait, what was going on? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2304.44s)]
*  I don't need to bother with that, but just politics. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2306.6s)]
*  But more importantly, I had already signed with William Morris. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2309.48s)]
*  I had already done a movie, TV movie, where I met my wife. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2313.7999999999997s)]
*  I didn't need to stay. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2318.7599999999998s)]
*  And it just, I don't say I outgrew it. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2320.92s)]
*  I got enough and the agents would call them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2323.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, I can go back to work. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2326.36s)]
*  I don't need to stay because you would have to stay another two years to get a master's. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2327.4s)]
*  And I'm already signed with William Morris and get in work. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2331.16s)]
*  So I left after a year. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2334.04s)]
*  This is sort of a base question, but did you find that you cared at all about not [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2336.6s)]
*  getting an Oscar nomination for Gladiator 2? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  Did it matter? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2343.48s)]
*  I was sitting there smiling, going, listen, look at you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2344.92s)]
*  The day you didn't get a nomination for an Oscar, you're working on Othello on Broadway. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2354.2s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2359.72s)]
*  Oh, I'm so upset. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2361.24s)]
*  I'm happy for all that did and I'm happy with what I'm doing. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2366.6s)]
*  Listen, I've been around too long and I got, I don't want to say other fish to fry, but [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2373.64s)]
*  there's a reality at this age, going back to what I was saying, the beginning of wisdom [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2385.64s)]
*  is understanding. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2391.24s)]
*  And I'm getting wiser, working on talking less and learning to understand more. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2393.16s)]
*  And that's exciting. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2403.0s)]
*  Is there anything you want people to take away from this interview? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2406.6s)]
*  Believe in something greater than yourself. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2413.72s)]
*  Believe it's a complicated world. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2417.3199999999997s)]
*  There's too much information coming at us from too many places, good and bad, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2423.0s)]
*  for us to think that we can reduce it all to our level of understanding with our little brain. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2427.4s)]
*  We are being forced to have faith. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2437.32s)]
*  However you interpret that, we are being forced by our circumstances. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2441.56s)]
*  Look at the world. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2447.8s)]
*  What does it give you every day? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2449.1600000000003s)]
*  Fires, death, murder, politics, dictators, this, that, division, separation. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2451.24s)]
*  I'm right, you're wrong. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2460.84s)]
*  Look at the world we've created for ourselves. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2463.0s)]
*  That's all I got to say. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2467.0s)]
*  Mr. Washington, thank you for taking all the time to talk with me. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2471.08s)]
*  This was a challenge and I appreciate you making it a challenge. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bISIqXEsFFU&t=2474.04s)]
