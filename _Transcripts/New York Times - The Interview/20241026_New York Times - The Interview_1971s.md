# John Fetterman Fears Donald Trump is Stronger Than Ever
**New York Times - The Interview:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00)
*  And may God bless the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=0.0s)]
*  As I'm sure you've noticed, it is almost election day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And possibly no state is more important to both candidates than Pennsylvania. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=8.52s)]
*  Its junior Democratic Senator, John Fetterman, has been stumping for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=14.48s)]
*  Harrison Walsh is the team that's going to lead our nation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  But he also has some thoughts about Donald Trump's strength in his state. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  It's real. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  In this interview, we discuss Fetterman's own intense support for Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=28.4s)]
*  We can both agree that the misery and the deaths in Gaza is terrible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=33.08s)]
*  Some people blame Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=38.2s)]
*  I blame Hamas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=39.2s)]
*  And where he fits or doesn't fit in his own party. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  And I don't know why that's controversial. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=46.16s)]
*  Here's my interview with Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=47.8s)]
*  Senator Fetterman, thank you so much for speaking with us today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=59.4s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  Before we get started, can you explain a little bit of the technology that you use in order [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=64.8s)]
*  to have these kinds of conversations? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=69.88s)]
*  I mean, it's just like your glasses. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=72.48s)]
*  If somebody needs those glasses to read something on a page, doesn't mean you're illiterate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=75.84s)]
*  It just means that you need a tool to do that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=81.58s)]
*  Or if you need glasses to drive, that doesn't mean you don't know how to drive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=85.2s)]
*  It just means that's a tool to allow you to facilitate the process. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=89.16s)]
*  And this captioning is the same thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=93.2s)]
*  It just allows me to fully absorb what's being said. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=96.16s)]
*  It allows me to provide a response to make sure that I absolutely know what's been what. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=100.36s)]
*  You've been very open about your stroke and also about getting treatment for depression [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=107.04s)]
*  early last year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  How are you doing with both those things? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=112.78s)]
*  Well, fantastic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=115.22s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, the only lingering issue after that was just about using this captioning. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, everything else has been back to even better. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=126.66s)]
*  One of the things that you've hoped for when you had talked about, especially your grappling [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=133.02s)]
*  with mental health, was that you were wanting to destigmatize it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=138.38s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=143.14s)]
*  Because at that point, I thought that it's an important conversation to have that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=146.46s)]
*  And if it's not necessarily for yourself, or it's probably someone that you know, somebody [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=152.46s)]
*  that you love, someone that you work with, or whatever, they have those kinds of issues. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=157.96s)]
*  And at that time, I didn't think that it was going to reach so many people or penetrate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=163.86s)]
*  And I was actually surprised that on a daily times, people reach out and say, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  Actually, I was just at an event last night, and people said, hey, you know, thank you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=176.3s)]
*  for talking about this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  You know, it really was helpful for me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=181.62s)]
*  And even times some people reach out and saying, hey, I got help, or that may have saved their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't take credit for that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=190.66s)]
*  But I will say that that's why I'm continuing to have that conversation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=192.28s)]
*  You've gotten a lot of attention recently for some of your positions since joining the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=197.22s)]
*  Senate last year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  Not only your story of personal struggle, but also your positions politically and your [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=204.7s)]
*  place in the Democratic Party, which has shifted. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=211.54s)]
*  Why do you no longer define yourself as a progressive? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=214.78s)]
*  Well, I haven't done that for years and years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=218.78s)]
*  And I wanted to take this opportunity to say that that was never new news. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, even before my election, even earlier than that, I've been, it's like, hey, the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  label leave me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=234.18s)]
*  I didn't leave it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  And what was originally progressive eight years ago, that was $15 an hour. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=238.78s)]
*  That is now pro-union and legalizing marijuana and just taking the very common sense things. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=244.62s)]
*  And that actually have been co-opted by the mainstream. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  But now and then it continued to adopt really extreme kinds of views. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=257.38s)]
*  And that's why I was like, hey, I'm just a Democrat. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=264.24s)]
*  And then there was a lot of like, well, is that going to be the next mansion or cinema [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=269.42s)]
*  or anything? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=274.5s)]
*  It's like, no, that's ridiculous. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=275.5s)]
*  I'm not leaving my party. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=278.18s)]
*  I just happen to have reasonable views. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know why that's controversial, whether what I've decided to platform about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=282.86s)]
*  my views on Israel or the border or those kinds of issues. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=289.5s)]
*  To me, that's just reasonable. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=294.26s)]
*  I'm not offended if somebody else disagrees with me in the party, but I'm incredibly, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=297.0s)]
*  I guess, disappointed that progressives now are making it more and more about things that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=302.88s)]
*  are incredibly hurtful to particularly like the Jewish communities and things. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=308.68s)]
*  You said just now that progressives have adopted extreme positions which you don't agree with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=315.42s)]
*  anymore. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=321.36s)]
*  What would you say those are? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=322.36s)]
*  Like defund the police, those kinds of things like that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=323.72s)]
*  That was a gift, a huge gift to the Republicans. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  And they've weaponized that into, in fact, Democrats are still getting stick with those [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=331.88000000000005s)]
*  kinds of things. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=336.82000000000005s)]
*  And now just some of these protesting right now, I mean, Colombia, we're all in New York [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=339.16s)]
*  right now and a lot of these views. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=344.12s)]
*  And now they're openly being supportive of Hamas or they're now calling for the infatata [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  and these kinds of extreme absurd things. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=353.04s)]
*  And they are supporting the kinds of regimes that live and impose the kind of values that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=356.14s)]
*  are antithetical to the progressive kinds of way that they would live. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=364.56s)]
*  I want to talk about your positions on Israel, but I do sort of want to stick with first [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=369.0s)]
*  the idea of where you sit in the party. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=374.64s)]
*  What do you say to progressives who funded your campaigns initially and supported you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=378.52s)]
*  and now say that they feel burned by you? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=384.06s)]
*  Well, that's, oh, thank gosh that wasn't loaded. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=387.0s)]
*  Well, it's like, I don't know why they decided to support me. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=394.52s)]
*  And if they can't follow me because I'm very fully supportive of the police or that I'm [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  fully supportive about Israel and now you choose not to vote for me, that's a choice [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=408.24s)]
*  that you have. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=412.44s)]
*  But I would find any votes that I've made as a senator that offends or is antithetical [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=414.6s)]
*  to being a good, strong Democrat. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=421.6s)]
*  And I would remind any one of those saying, we are, you know, my seat is the only reason [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  why it's mathematically possible that we could even retain the majority in this cycle because [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  we were the only ones that flipped in that cycle. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=435.24s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about your own history and your connection to your state. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  When did you start having political aspirations? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=444.04s)]
*  When did you want to become a politician? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=446.8s)]
*  It's still a point I don't consider myself a politician. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=451.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=454.6s)]
*  No, I know that's not me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=455.6s)]
*  That's not, I'm not trying to avoid using the label. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=457.0s)]
*  I just think I'm an advocate for certain issues or perspectives or things and that just happens [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=463.0s)]
*  to be the job that you're in. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=468.16s)]
*  It wasn't like, it wasn't a path or traditional sense, but I don't feel differently, behave [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=471.92s)]
*  differently. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=478.92s)]
*  When I was a mayor, now that I'm a United States Senator, I don't dress differently. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=480.16s)]
*  I still live in Braddock. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=486.76s)]
*  I'm a family guy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=489.96s)]
*  I remain a family guy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=491.28s)]
*  I haven't really changed as a person. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=493.12s)]
*  It's interesting that you said you don't see yourself as a politician. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=497.8s)]
*  What does a politician seem to you when you say that in your head? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=501.84s)]
*  What is that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=506.84s)]
*  That it's a track. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=508.68s)]
*  Everybody's constantly looking for the next job and it's incredibly cynical and transactional [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=510.76s)]
*  and now dysfunctional. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=519.28s)]
*  I've been disappointed on the reality of a part of it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=522.76s)]
*  It's just also astonishing and I can't understand why there's people that are willing to spend [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=526.76s)]
*  tens of millions of their own money to try to hold that office because then you can get [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  there and be like, look at the glamour. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=536.92s)]
*  I'm sitting in a 500 square feet apartment and I'm like, I'm on Grubhub. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=540.88s)]
*  Hey, what do I have? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=546.36s)]
*  I'm watching bad TV on Netflix or whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=548.48s)]
*  I like to ask all of my colleagues, well, hey, is there some kind of secret society [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=551.84s)]
*  or a social life or something glamorous? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=556.2s)]
*  No. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  And even Romney, he's incredibly wealthy and he has a nice house, but I read that he sits [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  on his nice chair and watches Netflix and eats salmon from his friend and actually puts [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=567.1600000000001s)]
*  ketchup on it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=573.72s)]
*  I haven't met that one person that's having that quintessential glamorous life. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  It's been elusive for me, but it's not one that it would even appeal to me. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  I think people all think life is like the West Wing or something, where it's snappy [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=588.28s)]
*  dialogue and it's like, I don't know, whatever. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=593.54s)]
*  But a lot of it comes down to just really bad performance art. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the things that I think has been very distinctive about you is that you dress differently. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=599.54s)]
*  You use language differently. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  Is that important to you, not changing your demeanor to sort of fit into this idea of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=606.4s)]
*  this politician that you seem to reject? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=611.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=614.16s)]
*  It would be exhausting to be anything other than that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=615.16s)]
*  And let's be practical. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=619.4s)]
*  I dress like a bum because it's terrible to try to find clothes. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=621.36s)]
*  I can't find a suit. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=627.28s)]
*  I truly can't afford custom tailor suits. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's really just, it's just practical. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=634.52s)]
*  And it's just like most normal people in Pennsylvania dress like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=637.8s)]
*  And definitely in Western Pennsylvania, people wear shorts through the year. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=641.48s)]
*  And I do that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=646.24s)]
*  Also, it's perfect. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=647.24s)]
*  Your legs never get cold. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=648.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, I don't. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=649.24s)]
*  I don't. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=652.24s)]
*  But again, a lot of that comes back to practical. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=653.24s)]
*  It's just easier in that sense. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=658.72s)]
*  I'm not making a statement. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=660.36s)]
*  I want to understand a little bit about how you've been navigating some of the currents [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=663.16s)]
*  in the party. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=667.12s)]
*  And so I'd like to take you back to some of the biggest moments for Democrats in this [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=668.12s)]
*  very insane presidential cycle. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=673.0s)]
*  After the Biden-Trump debate, at a moment when other Democrats were turning on Biden [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=676.48s)]
*  for his cognitive decline, you went up against them in private and in public. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  And you tweeted that you weren't going to join the Democratic vultures. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=686.8s)]
*  Why did you feel so strongly at the time that the party should have stood behind the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=691.56s)]
*  president? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=696.52s)]
*  So I actually didn't see that debate. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=698.0s)]
*  I was actually flying back from Israel. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=700.1999999999999s)]
*  So I just started seeing some messages about that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  But I really thought that what Joe Biden has done for our nation was remarkable. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=705.4s)]
*  And I live through my own personal kind of a crucible of having hundreds of millions [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=713.04s)]
*  of dollars just destroying you, tearing you apart. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=719.6s)]
*  But he held every line throughout all of that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=722.9200000000001s)]
*  And I just have nothing but have to respect the strength there. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=726.4s)]
*  And then it may not be traditional kinds of strength, but it's kinds of quiet, dignity [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=733.52s)]
*  kind of strength. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=739.8000000000001s)]
*  And a lot of the important things that he's done while he's been a president, he's been [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=741.48s)]
*  an amazing president. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=745.72s)]
*  And I'm not saying that as a partisan. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=746.72s)]
*  I think objectively. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=748.64s)]
*  And people suddenly decided we've got to cut him loose and thrown away and to throw away [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=750.0s)]
*  a man and a 50 year career on a debate. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=756.96s)]
*  And I always believe that he had a path. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=760.48s)]
*  And it's probably reasonable to think that there may not have the path that come through [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=763.36s)]
*  Georgia or Arizona, but it is going to be the blue wall. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  And here we are now that the blue wall remains to be the quickest way to just put to put [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump out. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=780.5200000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you still perhaps regret the fact that Joe Biden is not the candidate. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=782.88s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=790.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't I don't regret that he's not that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=792.88s)]
*  No, Harris has run a magnificent campaign through this. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=794.6s)]
*  Things couldn't have possibly gone any better. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=799.12s)]
*  Truthfully, truly, truly. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=802.36s)]
*  But what I've been saying then is like, I'd like to remind America that this is the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  only living person that's beat Trump. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=809.6400000000001s)]
*  And that's that that means a lot. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=813.1600000000001s)]
*  And Harris has run an amazing campaign since then and everything came together. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=816.24s)]
*  But I've also warned that it's going to continually being very close. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=820.7600000000001s)]
*  So you're now fully behind Harris. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=825.72s)]
*  You've been campaigning for her. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=827.08s)]
*  She is running almost at a tie in your state. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=829.1600000000001s)]
*  You've said that Trump has a special connection with the people of Pennsylvania. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=832.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=836.7600000000001s)]
*  What is it that you you see that he appeals to in your state? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=837.6s)]
*  There's a difference between not not understanding, but also acknowledging that it [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=844.32s)]
*  exists and anybody spends time driving around and you can see the intensity. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=849.24s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=856.6s)]
*  I was doing an event in Indiana County, very, very red. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=858.24s)]
*  And there was a superstore of Trump stuff and it was a hundred feet long and it was [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=862.52s)]
*  dozens of t-shirts and hats and bumper stickers and all kinds of, I mean, it's [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=871.84s)]
*  like, where does this all come from? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=877.6s)]
*  I mean, it was almost like, like Taylor Swift kind of swag. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=879.4s)]
*  It's like of everything. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't just a sign. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=884.4s)]
*  It's the kinds of thing that has taken on its own life on that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=885.84s)]
*  And it's like something very special exists there. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=889.72s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that I admire it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=893.72s)]
*  It's just like, it's, it's real. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=895.56s)]
*  And now, and now you have Musk is now joining him. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, to a lot of people, I mean, that's like, Hey, that's, that's Tony [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=905.64s)]
*  Stark and that's the world's richest guy. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=909.1999999999999s)]
*  And he's obviously, and undeniably, he's a brilliant guy and he's saying, Hey, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=912.64s)]
*  that's my guy for president. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=917.36s)]
*  That's going to really matter. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=918.72s)]
*  You've alluded to the fact that people see Elon Musk as Iron Man, Tony Stark. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=920.2s)]
*  What do you see as the union of these two people? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=925.52s)]
*  Like, what, what do you think it does? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=927.72s)]
*  I was alarmed, but I was truly alarmed about that when he started showing up. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=929.6s)]
*  I mean, I've been there, not at that rally, but when, when they were having [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=937.1600000000001s)]
*  the AI conference in, in Washington at the, he showed up at my building at [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=942.4s)]
*  Russell and senators were like, Oh, Oh, they were like, you know, like I gotta [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  have two minutes, you know, please, whatever. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  So, so if senators are all like, you know, like, then can you imagine what, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=954.7199999999999s)]
*  you know, voters in Scranton or all across Pennsylvania be like, you know, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=960.7199999999999s)]
*  in, in some sense, he's a bigger star than, than Trump is. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  And so like we're in a business, you know, endorsements, they're really [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=968.6s)]
*  not meaningful, often, but this one is, I think that has me concerned. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=973.88s)]
*  I mean, Pennsylvania is a place with a lot of union workers. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=980.48s)]
*  Did it make you nervous that the teamsters, for example, didn't [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=983.52s)]
*  back a Democrat for president? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=988.48s)]
*  Well, I think that's finally making the, the, the grassroots already more official. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=991.12s)]
*  You know, I, I'll never forget. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=998.24s)]
*  I live directly across the street from the steel mill and we were [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1000.6s)]
*  doing an event there for, for Clinton. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1005.12s)]
*  And I asked the, the union president, I'm like, Hey, where are we are on Trump? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1007.84s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, probably half or 60% to two thirds are voting for him. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  And I was like, Oh, that sucks. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1018.84s)]
*  And then immediately there was a guy getting off and he had a truck and he [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1021.12s)]
*  had a truck nuts on it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1026.28s)]
*  You know what truck nuts are? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1028.44s)]
*  Do I look like I know what truck nuts are? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1030.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's balls hung on, on the hitch of a truck and he honked and he [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1031.84s)]
*  was like, go Trump as he drove by. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1037.48s)]
*  And, and it's like, Hey, we're in trouble. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1040.08s)]
*  And, and it's undeniable. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1042.52s)]
*  And some unions like SCI UI, you know, and, and, and the government [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1044.72s)]
*  kinds of unions are still very, very democratic, but, but those others, you [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1049.2s)]
*  know, I think a lot of their membership for a lot of people, you know, Trump has [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1054.4s)]
*  that kind of a connection, some cultural stuff, right? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1059.44s)]
*  Very visceral in that sense. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1062.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1063.92s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's, that's real. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1064.5600000000002s)]
*  And I witnessed that and that's why I'm concerned and that's why polls were [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1067.16s)]
*  inaccurate and that's why now I'm saying we got a fight for every last vote. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1072.44s)]
*  It's going to matter. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  Do you think the polls are inaccurate this time? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, my, my polls in my race all said I was going to lose by one or two points [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1082.04s)]
*  and I carried it by five points and everybody thought that Clinton was going [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1087.0s)]
*  to just kill them and of course, no. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1091.72s)]
*  And people thought that in 2020 Biden was going to have like five, five points. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1095.76s)]
*  And I'm like, no, this isn't going to be a five point race here. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1101.16s)]
*  And it was an end. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1104.76s)]
*  It was incredibly close. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1105.8s)]
*  And that same thing has been replicated now. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1107.48s)]
*  And the only thing that's changed is he's more popular even. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1110.84s)]
*  And Hey, you know, you have Elon Musk standing right next to him too. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not sure what else has changed, except if anything, Trump has become more [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1119.8s)]
*  capable to withstand whatever, you know, whether it was the trials or the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1127.52s)]
*  assassination or all of those things. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1134.32s)]
*  But here he is. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  You were outspoken during the 2020 election ballot counting and challenges. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  Election officials in Pennsylvania are warning now that the ballots [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1144.32s)]
*  could take days to count. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1148.3600000000001s)]
*  Is that something you're worried about? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1149.68s)]
*  Well, that, that, well, I, I, I'm very hopeful and I do think that now four [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1151.48s)]
*  years later, Philadelphia can now process those votes quickly, just like the same [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  thing that Allegheny County has done that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1162.72s)]
*  And then now why there is no, that huge, how many days of like wondering, and now [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1164.9199999999998s)]
*  that allows people to pound, pound, pound, you know, it's rigged, it's rigged, it's [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  rigged, and that was allowed for people to say, you know, set the stage saying bad [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  things happen in Philadelphia and it's gonna dog with Sullivan. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1180.1999999999998s)]
*  And then that's why that allows it to, to, to stir the shit, the shit storm. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1185.36s)]
*  So as long as Philadelphia is able to do the kind of quick around, just like [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1191.12s)]
*  Allegheny, then, then I think you'll have a lot, a lot less opportunity. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1195.52s)]
*  And then also Trump was the sitting president at that time and now he's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1199.76s)]
*  just a private citizen, so he has a less ability to change the weather. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1204.08s)]
*  You mentioned Israel earlier, and I do want to ask you about some of what [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1211.84s)]
*  you said in the past year, because you've become one of the most pro-Israel [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1216.2s)]
*  Democrats in the Senate, where there has been some division within the party over [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  what's been happening in the Middle East. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1228.0400000000002s)]
*  I would love to understand where your affinity with the state of Israel [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1230.96s)]
*  actually comes from. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1234.92s)]
*  Can you explain its origin to me? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1236.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1238.48s)]
*  Well, well, I mean, I don't, I can't say that there is an origin. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1239.0s)]
*  I think it's really about, that's our ally. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1242.3600000000001s)]
*  There's a special relationship. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1246.28s)]
*  And now if anyone that studies history realized that if you're, if you [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1248.4s)]
*  are not willing to stand and protect and support the Jewish community, that can, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1252.16s)]
*  that can end in incredibly terrible, awful ways. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1258.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what history has taught us. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1262.8000000000002s)]
*  And now to anybody that doesn't follow the history and not even aware of a lot [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1266.0s)]
*  of it, you know, like err on the side of democracy, and that is the only democracy [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  in the middle of that region. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1275.16s)]
*  And I've, I had the chance to visit there and that's the kind of society that have [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1277.0s)]
*  the same kinds of values that we live and what we aspire to, especially ironically, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1284.2s)]
*  progressives, especially for, for women and members of the LGBTQ communities. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1289.2s)]
*  And that's why it's so it's for me, it's an easy choice through this. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1295.72s)]
*  In January, you were one of two Senate Democrats. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1300.28s)]
*  The other was Joe Manchin. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  Who didn't sign on to support a measure endorsing the creation of a Palestinian state. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1305.28s)]
*  This was part of a national security package that included military aid to Israel. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1310.96s)]
*  Can you explain that vote to me? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1315.36s)]
*  I really used to believe that it's a, it's a done, it should be a done [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1318.0s)]
*  deal for the, the, the, the, a two state solution. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1321.72s)]
*  I mean, that, that, that became part of the boiler plate for Democrats. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1325.76s)]
*  And I assume that must be true. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1329.8s)]
*  But the way, the way things have things have evolved and where we're at now, I mean, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1331.8s)]
*  that would be ideal. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1338.32s)]
*  I wish there would could be peaceful two states, but the way things continues to evolve. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1339.32s)]
*  I, I'm, I'm unsure if that's even possible. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1347.64s)]
*  I'm hopeful, but I'm now, I'm not convinced that's even viable, but what seems to be [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1350.3600000000001s)]
*  true and one of the enduring truths through this is that Israel continues to confront [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1356.44s)]
*  the kinds of singular evil that really manifests its way in October 7th. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1363.52s)]
*  And they have the, they have the right and, and strategically to destroy Hamas. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  And then now Hezbollah, you know, everybody, experts describe, describe [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1376.4s)]
*  Hezbollah as like the ultimate badass. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1381.0s)]
*  And Israel demolished them over within the next week and a half and there's no [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1384.0s)]
*  leadership left and, and those are the kinds of hard things that needed to finally be [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1390.4s)]
*  confronted if they're ever going to have some more, more enduring peace. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1395.8400000000001s)]
*  I think there's two things going on. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1402.28s)]
*  One is the destruction of Hamas and Hezbollah, which are deemed terrorist [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1403.96s)]
*  organizations by the United States. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1407.6000000000001s)]
*  And then there's how you go about doing that and what is the cost. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1409.48s)]
*  And people would look at the cost of how many people have been killed civilians in [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1414.0400000000002s)]
*  Gaza and say that the cost is too high and that too many civilians have died. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1418.8000000000002s)]
*  So I guess I'm, I'm struggling to, to understand a little bit of the [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1425.24s)]
*  nuance there from you. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1430.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, there isn't any nuance. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1432.2s)]
*  There isn't any nuance. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1434.48s)]
*  You think that the price that's been paid is fair? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1435.76s)]
*  The price is terrible. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1439.04s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1441.64s)]
*  That's, that's history and that's war. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1442.64s)]
*  And Israel was forced to fight an enemy that are cowardly. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1446.04s)]
*  They hide in tunnels. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1452.1200000000001s)]
*  They hide in schools and in refugee camps and they're in those kinds of places. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1454.16s)]
*  And that forces them to, to reach them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1459.88s)]
*  They have to go through these civilians. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1462.88s)]
*  That's why they're so evil. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1464.96s)]
*  And that's why that's designed the death and destruction and the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1466.72s)]
*  misery was designed by Hamas. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1470.6799999999998s)]
*  They understood that that's going to happen. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1473.52s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1475.48s)]
*  So we can both agree that the misery and the deaths in Gaza is, is terrible. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1476.6799999999998s)]
*  And, you know, some people blame Israel. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1482.84s)]
*  Well, I blame Hamas. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1485.84s)]
*  As you mentioned, you, you visited Israel for the first time in June. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1489.0s)]
*  You met with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked you for [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  your courage and your support of Israel. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1496.76s)]
*  How do you see his leadership during this conflict? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was really curious that Democrats felt like they were, they [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1503.8s)]
*  needed to politically to, to criticize Israel, but that would be difficult. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1509.24s)]
*  So they found that, well, I'm going to just, we're going to just focus on Netanyahu. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1516.6s)]
*  And you can think he's a bad leader or a bad person or anything, but that happens [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1521.3600000000001s)]
*  to be the democratically leader of, of Israel and he's on, he's on our side. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1526.8400000000001s)]
*  That's our ally. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1532.3600000000001s)]
*  And if you had to pick who you want to criticize, you should be criticizing Hamas. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1533.8000000000002s)]
*  You should be calling out Iran or she'd be calling out Hezbollah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, certainly not, you know, our ally. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1542.48s)]
*  So that's, that's, I think it was incredibly unhelpful and a bad leader for some people [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1545.56s)]
*  can be doing what I think is necessary. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1553.76s)]
*  And then no one has been able to answer the question. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1556.64s)]
*  It's like, how can you rebuild Gaza if Hamas is functional and still in charge? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1559.2s)]
*  How is that even possible? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1565.52s)]
*  Are you concerned that he's working to get Trump elected? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1567.4s)]
*  I don't, I don't, I don't believe that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1570.88s)]
*  I, I, I don't. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1573.0s)]
*  And if you think that that might be, I don't know why it's helpful to say that publicly, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1574.76s)]
*  you know, like I have to believe all of those college protesting and a lot of those [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1579.56s)]
*  other things, they would give Hamas opportunity to rejoice a lot of this division. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1585.6399999999999s)]
*  But now there's, there's not much left of them anymore to celebrate. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1592.6799999999998s)]
*  I am curious if on that trip you made to Israel, if you went to the West Bank at all [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1597.1599999999999s)]
*  and met any Palestinians there. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1601.7199999999998s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't go to the West. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1604.0400000000002s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  And then, so I didn't have unlimited time to see all the things that I wish I could. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1610.16s)]
*  But I would love to go back. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1617.16s)]
*  But I guess what I'm asking is if you've tried to understand the other side of this [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1619.3600000000001s)]
*  conflict. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1622.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I've talked to a lot of people. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1625.24s)]
*  I would, I would, I would visit and I would discuss members of the Arab and Muslim from [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1627.32s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1635.2s)]
*  I would have open dialogue. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1635.84s)]
*  I entertain that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1637.56s)]
*  I would be happy to, to really understand the other side. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1639.16s)]
*  And I've been unable to, other than it's like, hey, if we can just stop fighting and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1643.28s)]
*  attacking Israel, that's going to make the life, the quality of life for anyone in that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  region to start to get better. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1653.8799999999999s)]
*  I just want to bring it back to your state, though, because you have gotten criticism [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  from both Muslim groups and pro-peace Jewish groups. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1661.5200000000002s)]
*  Last month, the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh chapters of the Council on American Islamic [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1665.48s)]
*  Relations, they issued a joint statement where they condemned you for saying that you [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1669.72s)]
*  loved Israel's pager attacks targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1674.0400000000002s)]
*  I do. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1677.8000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1679.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, they said when our elected officials start condoning the civilian loss [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1681.0s)]
*  of life, our collective moral compass is irreparably harmed. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1684.92s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1687.64s)]
*  And indeed that attack did hurt and maim civilians. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1689.0800000000002s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1692.52s)]
*  It actually, it was targeted for members of Hezbollah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1693.0s)]
*  You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  That was a young child of a... [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1701.72s)]
*  That was a micro targeting to minimize. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1703.48s)]
*  That was a young child who was killed, who was taking the pager to their parents. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1706.04s)]
*  It did, unfortunately, tragically, because daddy was a member of Hezbollah. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1709.16s)]
*  That's tragic. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1713.8s)]
*  You know, he brought that danger and evil into their home. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1716.04s)]
*  And that's what tragically resulted in that poor child's death and that... [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1720.36s)]
*  That's what's so terrible. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1726.9199999999998s)]
*  She paid the price because her father was a terrorist for Hezbollah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1727.96s)]
*  And I grieve for the death of Palestinian children and other innocents there. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1732.12s)]
*  I don't assign any more value to their lives versus my own children's lives. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1738.2s)]
*  And that's why we have to destroy Hamas and we have to find, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1743.72s)]
*  develop a new way forward where people can live in peace. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1748.36s)]
*  So that these kinds of death and misery, it has to stop. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's not being driven by Israel. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1758.36s)]
*  It's driven by Hamas and Iran and that kinds of commitment to destroy the state of Israel. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1760.28s)]
*  And now you have idiots in this nation, you know, talking about and chanting about [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1767.96s)]
*  from the river to the sea and they try to pretend that doesn't exactly what that means. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1772.2s)]
*  And that is Israel is in the middle of the sea and that river and that has to be wiped free. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1776.68s)]
*  And that's at least own your anti-Semitism rather than trying to hide behind a turn on words. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1784.92s)]
*  I do want to ask you at one other place where you've been at odds with your party, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1794.3600000000001s)]
*  which is on immigration. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1797.8s)]
*  You understood that it was something that was going to affect people in your state and beyond. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1799.88s)]
*  It is. It's a huge issue. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1805.72s)]
*  My question is, the party has now embraced enforcement at the border, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1807.24s)]
*  but comprehensive immigration reform means legalization as well. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1811.96s)]
*  What posture do you think the party should be adopting? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1816.84s)]
*  How can the Democratic Party really deal with what has become a very, very divisive issue within it? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1819.96s)]
*  Well, we had to address it. I said that it's like, why is it controversial to say that we're [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1828.44s)]
*  going to need a secure border? And when you started looking at the numbers that were showing up, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1832.76s)]
*  and at some month it was the population of Pittsburgh showing up at the border in a month. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, if we want their own American dream and we would want to provide everyone's American dream, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1844.44s)]
*  that's the promise of immigrants. But how do you, what happens to all of them? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1850.92s)]
*  How can they be okay? And so, I mean, that's a real issue. Democrats can't stop, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1857.0s)]
*  like trying to tell people, well, don't believe your eyes, don't believe your eyes. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1863.16s)]
*  It's going to be okay. It's all working out. It's not, you know, it's like, and I'm the most pro [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1867.56s)]
*  immigration guy there is, but that has to be compatible with, we have a secure border. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1873.88s)]
*  And I will never listen to anyone's other side until you can explain, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1880.52s)]
*  like, how, how do we take care of them? Where do those resources come from? And where do they go? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1884.6s)]
*  Nobody could provide a serious answer to that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1892.12s)]
*  Do you think if the Democratic ticket loses this election, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1896.36s)]
*  it will be off the back of issues like immigration? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1899.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't. I mean, it's certainly in places like Arizona. And I know it is very meaningful in [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1902.9199999999998s)]
*  Pennsylvania as well, too. I don't think it's the defining issue. I think it, I just described that [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1910.92s)]
*  as the choice, the choice, two incredibly stark choices. It's not about a certain policy. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1917.96s)]
*  And it's definitely not going to be about fracking or some of these obscure things. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1927.24s)]
*  It's not a, it's not about that. It's, it's about that stark choice. And it's really much more, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1931.5600000000002s)]
*  it's visceral. And that's why the people that are left that haven't made up their decision [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1936.36s)]
*  are going to have this, you know, what do I want for the next four years? And I do believe enough [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1942.04s)]
*  people will choose Harris, but I do think it's going to be much, much closer than anyone would want. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZRbQlBQ00&t=1948.6799999999998s)]
