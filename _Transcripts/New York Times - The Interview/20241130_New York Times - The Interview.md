Video Description: We’re off for Thanksgiving weekend, but we are excited to bring you a great episode of the Modern Love podcast.


Stories of romantic love are everywhere, but the actor, singer and comedian Bridget Everett says great friendships deserve our time and attention, too. Not just onscreen, but in reality.


On the HBO Original series “Somebody Somewhere” (now in its third and final season), Everett stars as Sam, a character inspired by the actor’s own life. She tells the Modern Love host Anna Martin about how heartbreaking, hilarious and central platonic friendship is in the fictional world of the show, and in Everett’s own relationships.


Everett also reads a Modern Love essay called “When Your Greatest Romance Is a Friendship,” by the novelist Victor Lodato. Lodato was in his 40s when he accidentally found his “person” and became the platonic life partner of an artist in her 80s who lived across the street.


“Somebody Somewhere” is now streaming on Max. To listen to more episodes, please search Modern Love wherever you get your podcasts.

# From Modern Love Bridget Everett Says a Best Friend Can Be Your Greatest Love
**New York Times - The Interview:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY)
*  Hi there, it's Lulu. We're taking this week off for Thanksgiving, but we'll be back with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=0.0s)]
*  a new episode next Saturday when David interviews actress Tilda Swinton. In the meantime, I [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=5.82s)]
*  wanted to share with you a conversation I deeply enjoyed from our colleagues at the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=12.3s)]
*  Modern Love Podcast. Host Anna Martin spoke with Bridget Everett, who stars in the HBO [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=16.22s)]
*  series Somebody Somewhere, about the power of platonic love. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  Love now and always. Love stronger than anything. Love. And I love you more than anything. There's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=25.54s)]
*  still love. Love. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=37.46s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. Every week we bring you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=41.18s)]
*  stories and conversations inspired by the Modern Love column. We talk about lovers, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=45.5s)]
*  families, friends, and all the messiness of human relationships. Today, I talk to the actor, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=50.58s)]
*  singer, and comedian Bridget Everett. On the Peabody Award-winning HBO series Somebody [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=56.9s)]
*  Somewhere, now in its third and final season, Bridget stars as a 40-something woman named [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=63.42s)]
*  Sam. Sam has always loved to sing, but over time she's lost her self-confidence, and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=68.38s)]
*  she's given up on music entirely. It's only after Sam becomes best friends with a sweet, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  supportive man named Joel that she starts to build herself back up. He even pushes her [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=80.58000000000001s)]
*  to sing again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  One of my favorite singers in the entire world is here with us tonight. Sam Pyer, come on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=85.66000000000001s)]
*  up here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  No! [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  In this proud land we grew up strong. We were wanted all along. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  The two of them become so close, they even call each other from the toilet after eating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=107.98s)]
*  a questionable hors d'oeuvre called St. Louis sushi. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  To watch Somebody Somewhere is to fall in love with these two friends and to hope that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=128.62s)]
*  nothing gets in the way of what they share together. So I wanted to talk to Bridget about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=132.7s)]
*  how central a best friendship can be if we're willing to make the space for it in our lives. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=137.6s)]
*  And Bridget reads an essay about two friends with a bond so close, maybe we need a new [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=142.96s)]
*  word to define it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Bridget Everett, welcome to Modern Love. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=153.0s)]
*  Hi! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm so happy you're in the studio with us. So the show you star on, Somebody Somewhere, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  is currently on its third and final season. I love this show, but I'm really struggling [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=160.0s)]
*  with something. I hope you'll help me out. I find it tough to categorize the show in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=165.72s)]
*  terms of genre. I'm like, I want to call it a romantic comedy, but it's also sort of like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=169.56s)]
*  an ensemble slice of life. At times it's a musical. How would you describe the show? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=175.24s)]
*  Well, I have a terrible time describing it too, so maybe that's why we have such an intimate [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=180.16s)]
*  audience. I don't know, I think of it as, you know, people say dramedy, but kind of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=184.04s)]
*  just a slice of life, some tender moments, some, you know, and maybe a fart. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=189.4s)]
*  I was going to say some tender moments and then like a big diarrhea scene in season two. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=195.52s)]
*  Yeah, because that's real life. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=199.8s)]
*  Of course it's real life. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=200.88s)]
*  Maybe not for you, but for people I know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=201.88s)]
*  St. Louis sushi. Is that a real thing? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, my friend Larry Crone, it's one of his signature dishes at parties. You know, he [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=206.24s)]
*  always passes around his little can of pay or whatever, but it's basically ham wrapped [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=210.72s)]
*  around cream cheese wrapped around a pickle. And you know what, it's always a hit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  No, it sounds so good is the thing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=219.12s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, the show we had to kind of, you know, make it fun. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=221.28s)]
*  You had to make it fun by that. You had to fill it with a lot of farts. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=224.4s)]
*  OK, your character on Somebody Somewhere is a woman named Sam, who is somewhat inspired [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=227.96s)]
*  by your own life. Like you, Sam grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, where the show takes place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=233.0s)]
*  Sam loves singing, but she has a lot of fear and self-doubt around it. Whereas you, Bridget, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=239.52s)]
*  have a cabaret song where you proudly describe all the shapes and sizes boobs come in. I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=246.6s)]
*  love that song. You just seem fearless on stage. Have you ever had any of Sam's self-doubt [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=253.04s)]
*  in your own life? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=260.76s)]
*  Oh, sure. I mean, a lot of what I have in common with Sam is, you know, obviously the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=261.76s)]
*  love of singing and, you know, Sam really comes alive when she sings. And I feel the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=266.56s)]
*  same way. I feel like I connect, I kind of plug into life when I'm singing. There's a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=270.92s)]
*  way that I can connect to my emotions when I'm doing that that I can't sometimes do otherwise. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=274.36s)]
*  And I also struggle with the self-worth like she does. So over the course of these three [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=280.36s)]
*  seasons, as she is acknowledged kind of to herself what she's working through, I mean, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=285.24s)]
*  she doesn't say, oh, I'm Sam and I have self-doubt. You know, we sort of see her trying to push [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=291.04s)]
*  through some of that. And I've learned a lot from her. Like sometimes we write the scenes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=295.36s)]
*  and I'm like, man, I wish I could be like Sam. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Have you ever applied, I mean, I know it's like loosely autobiographical, but of course [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=303.0s)]
*  the show is a work of fiction, but you're saying that you've learned things from Sam. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=307.12s)]
*  Have you ever found yourself quite literally applying like a lesson that she's learned [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=310.8s)]
*  in the show to your own life? Like, do you ever do something in your life and think, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=315.8s)]
*  wow, I learned this from Sam, my character and somebody somewhere? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=319.12s)]
*  Absolutely. There's something that Sam says in season two, she's like, NNP, No New People. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=321.76s)]
*  And that's kind of like me. I have a lot of friends, my life is full enough. And I just, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=326.52s)]
*  I'm socially anxious, you know, like many people are. So I just like, I just rather [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=332.0s)]
*  not. But Sam, especially in season three is allowing more people into her life and into [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=335.64s)]
*  her heart. And I think that I have honestly been trying to work on that myself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=342.52s)]
*  Interesting. Okay. So what you're saying is in season two, Sam kind of adopts this, yeah, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=348.2s)]
*  life ethos, I don't know, mantra, No New People, meaning No New Friends. But then in season [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=353.36s)]
*  three, we see her sort of open back up again. And you're saying that you're trying to do [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=357.58s)]
*  the same thing in your life right now? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=361.72s)]
*  Because I think for me and for Sam, it's like, you know, if you're somebody that does struggle [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  with self worth, every time you meet somebody or like, they're going to see the cracks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, totally. Or that they'll just see what I don't like about myself. You know, and I [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=372.24s)]
*  think Sam feels that way. So she's like, I've got this person that makes me feel good. This [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  person makes me feel safe. And that was why it was so devastating in season one while [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  why her sister died, because her sister loved her warts and all, you know, and, and Joel, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=384.68s)]
*  he loves her warts and all. And, you know, I think it's just something that not everybody [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=390.08s)]
*  walks into a room and thinks people are going to like them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe most [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=397.12s)]
*  people don't. I really don't know. I don't think most people do. I certainly don't. But [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=403.0s)]
*  you're so right. In season three, this this current season of Somebody Somewhere, we see [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=406.88s)]
*  that that sort of protective shield start to crack in the best way. Yeah. And she's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=410.96s)]
*  terrified. But it's but she does it anyway, which is the theme of the season is growth [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=415.24s)]
*  against all odds. And I think that that is that. Is that something you said in like the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=419.36s)]
*  writers room growth against all odds? And I do have the necklace now and I'm not wearing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=424.2s)]
*  it right now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=427.76s)]
*  Wait, stop. You should have worn a necklace that says growth against all odds. That's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=428.76s)]
*  a lot to put on a necklace. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=431.76s)]
*  No, it's GAO. I have on one necklace. I also have a golden toilet, which is obviously from [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=432.76s)]
*  season two. And then from season one, I have a one because I'm number one on the call sheet. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, this may never happen again. So I bought myself a necklace. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=440.16s)]
*  I am so sad that you didn't wear all three. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=442.56s)]
*  I know I normally do, but I just I don't know. I don't know why I didn't do it today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=445.92s)]
*  I was, you know, I got my day started kind of early. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  You got a lot of things going on. I also want to say I love it. There's a lot of acronyms. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm realizing no new people. NNP. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  There's AGG. There's all glory to God, which is something that kind of goes by pretty quick. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=459.24s)]
*  But but I talk that way. That's that's kind of my you're an acronym gal. Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=463.48s)]
*  D.D.H.D. is my theme. You know, I got that from LL Cool J. Dreams don't have deadlines. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  This is such a fun thing to figure out about you. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=472.76s)]
*  Mary Hill and I text each other every day. R.F.B. Ready for bed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=474.56s)]
*  Murray Hill also stars on the show as as Fred. I love ready for bed. R.F.B. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=477.08s)]
*  Yeah. You've talked a bit about the relationship between Sam and her best friend, Joel, played by Jeff Hiller. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  For people who have not had the pleasure of seeing somebody somewhere, how would you explain who Sam and Joel are to each other? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=489.32s)]
*  It's a friendship, but there's there's so much more there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=496.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, Sam has lost her sister and and it was everything to her. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=499.72s)]
*  And then Joel kind of sneaks in and he's so undeniable. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=504.88s)]
*  He's so charismatic and charming and smile just like smile lights everyone up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=508.04s)]
*  Yeah. And he's got a great giggle. And and he's kind and she's kind of like a little like, you know, got a little more of an edge. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Most importantly, there's a really wonderful warm chemistry between the two of them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=518.76s)]
*  And and even when she kind of gets reactive or reactionary, he still loves her. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=524.08s)]
*  He's not going to dump her what she thinks that he's going to do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=530.72s)]
*  So and and she's so. You know, she's such a raw nerve. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=533.6s)]
*  And I don't know, just the way that Joel takes care of her is very moving to me. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=538.72s)]
*  And what I love about the relationship is, you know, sometimes you don't expect that you're going to meet such a. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=544.24s)]
*  Central relationship to your life in your 40s. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=552.56s)]
*  And I think that's incredible. Goes against the NNP. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  No new people. But I just I just love it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=558.16s)]
*  And I also love that it's a real primary thing for Sam, like her friends are her people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=561.04s)]
*  Right. And it's not like she's looking for a romantic love. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=566.16s)]
*  She's she's looking for her person. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=570.16s)]
*  And and that's kind of what she is finding in Joel. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=572.64s)]
*  Yeah. Her person. I mean, I think it's a really. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=576.64s)]
*  I don't know if I'll say like kind of radical reframe, the idea that your person can be a friend. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. And it doesn't mean that you can't have, you know, romantic relationships and you can't, you know, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=585.52s)]
*  have a couple of roles in the hay and a little, you know, a little smoochy smooch in the alley after a couple of drinks in a bar. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=591.12s)]
*  But but I think that for me, it was really important that this show be about the friendship and not about like girl meets boy boy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  In the way that you meet a guy and, you know, all of a sudden he thinks you're beautiful. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=605.84s)]
*  You fall in love in that way. This is a different kind of love, which is, you know, why I love the essay that we're going to be talking about later. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  But yeah. Yeah. And we're going to go to the essay reading in just a bit. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  But before we do, I want to talk about a moment on the show that I think is the epitome of this kind of love between friends that you're talking about. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  Early in this new season, Sam helps Joel's boyfriend, whose name is Brad, write a love song as a as a secret surprise for Joel. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=630.88s)]
*  And first of all, that's already a nice enough gesture from Sam. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=640.8s)]
*  But it means even more because we've seen her really struggle with the fact that Joel is now in a couple and isn't around for her as much. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=644.48s)]
*  Can you tell us what happens when they're all at the party and Brad gets up to sing this love song for Joel? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=655.44s)]
*  Yeah. The character of Brad played by the wonderful and underutilized Tim Bagley, the place Joel's boyfriend gets up to sing the song. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=662.8800000000001s)]
*  And he loves Joel, but he hasn't really been able to or had the need to say that publicly. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=674.12s)]
*  And he's doing it in front of Joel's friends and his church friends. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=680.88s)]
*  And as soon as he starts to try to speak, he's so overwhelmed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=684.08s)]
*  And it reminds me of a very it's a very Midwestern thing and probably other places, too. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=689.08s)]
*  But when my brother did the toast at his daughter's wedding, he was like, OK, I just want to do it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  And he like it's just like, you know, that thing like and he couldn't talk. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=704.48s)]
*  It was just like, you know, we got huge. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=708.12s)]
*  The emotion is caught in the throat. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=709.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's exactly the thing when it's too much. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=711.4s)]
*  Yeah. And and what I love about it is like that Sam is right there with him and she's like, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=714.04s)]
*  I'm going to help you get through this because she knows what it's going to mean to Joel. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=719.4799999999999s)]
*  And she jumps in and she starts singing for him. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=723.28s)]
*  Yeah. She knows how special Joel is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=725.92s)]
*  And so anytime that she can communicate that, share that, especially through music, she's going to do it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=730.5999999999999s)]
*  Bridget, would you mind if you want? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=737.48s)]
*  It would be amazing to hear like a line. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=740.24s)]
*  But I don't know if you're prepared to sing today. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=743.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you like the beginning of the song? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=746.32s)]
*  I would love to. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  OK, sure. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  I wake in the morning and I see your face. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=752.72s)]
*  I'm the luckiest guy in the entire human race. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=757.6s)]
*  A cup of coffee or a trip to the store. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  I'll take forever and then I'll take some more. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=766.64s)]
*  But oh, the way you look at me, I can't explain it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=771.4s)]
*  But I know it's love. Oh, love, love. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=778.4s)]
*  That's first one. Oh, my God. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=786.16s)]
*  Don't do this to me right now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=788.04s)]
*  I don't know. It is so God. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=789.96s)]
*  And you wrote these lyrics. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=792.72s)]
*  It is so simple and it's perfect. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=795.0s)]
*  Of course, this is a love song, ostensibly for one man to another man, you know, between two men who love each other. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=797.88s)]
*  But also, I don't know. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, I was also Sam's love for Joel and the way that she's looking at him. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=804.84s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, I 100 percent agree. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=808.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for singing that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=812.08s)]
*  I really feel grateful to be in the room when you do that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=814.24s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=816.96s)]
*  OK, that is that's tough act to follow. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=818.76s)]
*  You are also here to do us another favor, which is to read a modern love essay. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=821.16s)]
*  Do you want to say anything about this essay before you get into it? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=825.76s)]
*  Why you chose it? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=827.88s)]
*  Well, I chose it because, you know, the title, When Your Greatest Romance is a Friendship, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=829.32s)]
*  because it's something that I can relate to. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=835.04s)]
*  And I read it. I thought it was such a sweet and moving examination of two people, not romantically linked. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=838.44s)]
*  I don't know. I just thought it was really special. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=849.8s)]
*  We'll be back in just a minute with Bridget Everett reading today's modern love essay. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=852.92s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=858.0s)]
*  OK, Bridget, you are about to read a modern love essay for us by the novelist Victor Lodato. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=869.92s)]
*  Whenever you're ready. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=876.24s)]
*  When your greatest romance is a friendship. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=878.48s)]
*  Is this your grandson? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=883.08s)]
*  People sometimes ask Austin when she's out with me. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  No, honey, he's my friend. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=888.48s)]
*  At this point, folks usually smile tightly and turn away, perhaps worried there is more than friendship going on between the old lady and the younger man seated at the bar, giggling like teenagers. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  Why we're giggling, I couldn't tell you. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  Often our mirth seems fueled by some deep-selled delight at being together. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  When I met Austin, I was in my early 40s and not looking for a friend. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=913.7199999999999s)]
*  I'd come alone to the small Oregon town to finish a book. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  So when a bony, blue-eyed stranger knocked at my door, introducing herself as the lady from across the way and wondering if I might like to come over and see her garden, maybe have a genitonic, I politely declined. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  Watching her walk away, though, in her velvet slip-ons and wrinkled blouse, I felt a strange pang, a slow pin of sadness that I suppose could be best described as loneliness. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  Suddenly, I was dashing into the dirt road to say that I was sorry that she had caught me in the middle of work, but that yes, I would enjoy seeing her garden. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  Not the genitonic, she said. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=956.6s)]
*  Oh, sure, that too, I answered, blushing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=958.52s)]
*  And before I could suggest a visit the next week, she said, so I'll see you in a few hours then, shall we say 430? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=961.2s)]
*  I had to admire her sense of time. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=967.8s)]
*  Next week is for someone who can afford to put things off. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=970.24s)]
*  Austin, in her 80s, surely felt no such luxury. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=973.88s)]
*  I liked your face, she admitted later, telling me she had spotted me at the mailbox. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=979.52s)]
*  As she poured the gin, I told her that I'd seen her at the mailbox as well, and I liked her face too. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=984.8s)]
*  I wish I had better eyebrows, she said. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=991.52s)]
*  They used to be fabulous. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=994.0s)]
*  Her garden was astounding, like something dreamed rather than planted, a mad hatter gothic in which a lawless grace prevailed. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=996.76s)]
*  At dusk, the deer arrived, nibbling the crabapple blossoms. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1005.64s)]
*  We had been talking for hours, slightly tipsy, and then we were in the kitchen cooking dinner. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1009.24s)]
*  A retired psychologist, Austin had traveled extensively, spoke terrible Spanish and worse French, and was a painter now. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1015.76s)]
*  She had two husbands, the second of whom died in this house, in a small bed in the living room. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1024.04s)]
*  That's what I'll do, Austin told me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1030.84s)]
*  This room gets the best light. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1033.92s)]
*  We turned to the windows, but the light was already gone. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1038.08s)]
*  That we could be quiet together so soon and without strain felt auspicious. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1041.6s)]
*  So you've run away from home, she said at one point. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1049.04s)]
*  There was something about our interaction that reminded me of friendships from my childhood, in which no question was off limits. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1052.24s)]
*  On religion, she claimed to be an atheist. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1059.24s)]
*  I admitted to being haunted by the ghosts of a Roman Catholic upbringing. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1062.24s)]
*  She said her sisters believed in hell and worried about her soul. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  Austin, though, seemed afraid of nothing, least of all death. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  I said I was still afraid of the dark. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1075.6399999999999s)]
*  Living alone, she said, it can make you funny. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  I laughed, but changed the subject, telling her I would like to see her paintings. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  Later, crossing the road back to my Craiglist sublet, I wondered what I was doing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1091.6399999999999s)]
*  I reminded myself of my plan, hiding out, staying in the dream of the book. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1096.68s)]
*  I wasn't here to socialize. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1101.68s)]
*  I could finish a draft in a few months and head back home. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1103.68s)]
*  Besides, if I wanted a friend during my retreat, I would find someone my age to throw back beers with. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1107.68s)]
*  Gin and tonics with an old lady in her garden, that was not the plan. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1112.68s)]
*  But there I was the next weekend having dinner with her, and then it was every weekend. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1117.68s)]
*  Austin's older friends seemed good, but they were not. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1122.68s)]
*  I was confused. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1126.68s)]
*  Is he helping you with a computer? one asked. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1128.68s)]
*  When I first started talking about Austin to my out of town friends, they assumed I'd found a new boyfriend. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1130.68s)]
*  Austin's a woman, I would say. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1136.68s)]
*  Besides, she's in her 80s. She's just a pal. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1138.68s)]
*  Even as they replied, that's cool, I could almost hear them thinking, must be Slim Pickens out in Oregon. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1142.68s)]
*  What was perplexing, I suppose, was not that two people of such different ages had become friends, but that we had essentially become best friends. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1147.72s)]
*  Others regarded our devotion as either strange or quaint, like one of those unlikely animal friendships. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1156.72s)]
*  A monkey and a pigeon, perhaps. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1162.72s)]
*  Admittedly, when I would spot us in a mirror, I saw how peculiar we were. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1164.72s)]
*  And I was surprised to see that we were not just friends, but also friends of the same age. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1169.72s)]
*  When I would spot us in a mirror, I saw how peculiar we were. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1174.76s)]
*  This vivacious, white-haired imp in her bright colors and chunky-style jewelry, sitting with a dark-haired man in his drab, earth-tone sweaters and Clark Kent glasses. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1177.76s)]
*  Maybe I looked like some nerdy gigolo or this woman's attentive secretary. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1187.76s)]
*  If we made no sense from the outside, it didn't matter. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1192.76s)]
*  We were mostly looking at each other. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1195.76s)]
*  One night, Austin chatted about her life as a middle-aged wife in academia. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1199.76s)]
*  I completely missed out on the wildness of the 60s, she said. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1204.76s)]
*  I told her I'd missed out, too. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1208.76s)]
*  You weren't born yet, she said, or hardly. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1211.76s)]
*  Often we cooked together, as we had that first night, after which she would show me whatever painting she was working on. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1214.76s)]
*  At her request, I also started reading to her from my book in progress. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1221.76s)]
*  We gave each other feedback. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1227.76s)]
*  Our work improved. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1229.76s)]
*  When my six-month lease was up, I renewed it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1230.8s)]
*  The novel wasn't finished, plus I couldn't imagine a better neighbor. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1233.8s)]
*  Before I knew it, three years had passed. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1239.8s)]
*  I was writing seven days a week and spending most evenings with Austin. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1243.8s)]
*  Sometimes she had spells of vertigo now, and when we walked together she held my arm. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1247.8s)]
*  Often she couldn't find the right word for something. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1252.8s)]
*  When she wanted to keep away visitors so she could paint, she would hold my arm. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1255.8s)]
*  She hung a sign on her studio door, Do not destroy. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1260.8s)]
*  Soon the headaches came, and more jumbled language. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1264.8s)]
*  I need to screw my calls, she said, meaning she needed to screen them. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1268.8s)]
*  We laughed, then sobered. Tests were scheduled. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1274.8s)]
*  Now she is eight months into what the doctors say is a quick ravaging illness deep in her brain. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1278.8s)]
*  They say there is no stopping it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1284.8s)]
*  A year more if she's lucky. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1286.8s)]
*  Even as I refuse to believe this, I prepare for it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1290.8s)]
*  How? By keeping my promise to her. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1294.8s)]
*  A few months before her diagnosis, Austin had attended a wedding. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1298.8s)]
*  She showed me a copy of the vows, which had been distributed at the ceremony. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1302.8s)]
*  A detailed list. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1306.8s)]
*  I read it carefully at Austin's bidding. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1308.8s)]
*  We were sitting in a car waiting for our favorite Thai restaurant to open. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1311.8s)]
*  I never had anything like that with the men in my life, she said, pointing to the vows. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1315.8s)]
*  We loved each other, but we didn't have that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1320.8s)]
*  She was crying now, something she rarely did. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1324.8s)]
*  I took her hand and said, well, you have it with me, everything but the sex. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1327.8s)]
*  At which point the monkey kissed the pigeon. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1333.8s)]
*  That night I had an odd realization. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1340.8s)]
*  Some of the greatest romances of my life have been friendships. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1343.8s)]
*  And these friendships have been in many ways more mysterious than erotic love, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1346.84s)]
*  more subtle, less selfish, more attuned to kindness. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1351.84s)]
*  Of course, Austin was going to die long before I did. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1356.84s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1360.84s)]
*  This, I have come to understand, is a love story. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1362.84s)]
*  Austin continued to paint for several months more, fractured psychedelic self-portraits and stuff. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1370.84s)]
*  She painted her paintings in scorching colors, her best work. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1376.84s)]
*  Lately, though, she is tired and hardly leaves the couch. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1380.84s)]
*  I sit with her at the opposite end, our legs intertwined. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1384.84s)]
*  Read to me, she says. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1388.84s)]
*  When I tell her the book is finished, she tells me to read her something new. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1390.84s)]
*  But whenever I do, she promptly falls asleep. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1395.84s)]
*  I don't leave, though. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1402.84s)]
*  I stare out the window. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1404.84s)]
*  Austin was right. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1406.84s)]
*  This room does get the best light. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1408.84s)]
*  Recently, her hair is thinned, but she has a shock of white up front [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1411.84s)]
*  that a friend's daughter has died with a street Cuffecia. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1415.84s)]
*  She looks like some punk girl I might have dated in high school. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1418.84s)]
*  She had a bit more energy the last time I came to visit and said, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1424.84s)]
*  Oh, Victor, I had the most wonderful dessert today. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1428.84s)]
*  Peaches in Connecticut. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1431.84s)]
*  Have you ever had it? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1433.84s)]
*  No, I said smiling. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1434.8799999999999s)]
*  I love the idea of it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  Two things that don't seem to go together. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  Monkeys and pigeons. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  Peaches in Connecticut. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  Unlikely, yes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  But delicious beyond measure. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  Such a beautiful, beautiful essay. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  Tell me your thoughts. How did that feel to read? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1460.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that for me, as I mentioned before, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1462.92s)]
*  when you read about great loves, it always seems to be about a romantic relationship. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1471.92s)]
*  And I just love that these are two people that have found each other [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1478.92s)]
*  and they're the one for each other. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1485.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1490.96s)]
*  I think what's so great about this relationship is they just sort of slip into kind of a life together. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1491.96s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1497.96s)]
*  I want that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1501.96s)]
*  I'm surrounded by people in romantic relationships. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1503.96s)]
*  And it's not what I'm looking for, at least not right now. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1507.96s)]
*  And so when I see somebody that finds, first of all, it gives me hope that you can always find somebody. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1512.0s)]
*  They may not look like what you think you're going to want or what you're going to need. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1519.0s)]
*  It reminds me to stay open. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1525.0s)]
*  You know, the part where they talk about sitting on the couch and their legs intertwined is like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1530.0s)]
*  to have that kind of intimacy with somebody without the expectation of the other person. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1535.0s)]
*  To have that kind of intimacy with somebody without the expectation of a romance is, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1539.04s)]
*  it just hits me right in my heart. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1547.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1550.04s)]
*  I'm moved and I have this new neighbor and she's great. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1552.04s)]
*  And I can tell that she really misses the person that lived there before me. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1556.04s)]
*  And not that she's Austin or anything like that, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1560.04s)]
*  but I just think about the possibility of keeping yourself open [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1564.04s)]
*  and not running away from it because look at the great reward. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1567.08s)]
*  Look at the great reward between Victor and Austin. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1573.08s)]
*  And it is a thing, it's just like when all your friends are in relationships, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1576.08s)]
*  and you're like nobody's emergency contact, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1581.08s)]
*  it can feel a little lonely. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1584.08s)]
*  But there are other people out there that might be the same and looking for this. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1588.08s)]
*  There might be a lid for my pot. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1593.08s)]
*  I hate that expression. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1595.08s)]
*  But maybe my lid comes in the version of a lady with some comfortable slip-on shoes [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1597.08s)]
*  that's checking me out at my mailbox. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1605.08s)]
*  I was going to say that the fact that you are keeping yourself open [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1607.08s)]
*  to this friendship with your neighbor lady. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1611.08s)]
*  No, I'm trying. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1613.08s)]
*  But that's breaking the no new people rule. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1615.08s)]
*  You're breaking the no new people rule, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1617.08s)]
*  which is beautiful and amazing and brave and human and all of those things. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1619.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I just love that she's like, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1622.08s)]
*  okay, 430. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1624.12s)]
*  She's bringing him in. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1626.12s)]
*  And what she's saying, you don't have the luxury, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1628.12s)]
*  like later is for people who have time. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1631.12s)]
*  And honestly, the amount of loss I've experienced over the last few years, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1634.12s)]
*  we don't always have time. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1640.12s)]
*  So have the gin and tonic. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1642.12s)]
*  Have the gin and tonic while you can, absolutely. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1646.12s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1654.12s)]
*  You know, you're speaking about this neighbor and I want to ask too, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1672.12s)]
*  like reading this essay, obviously, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1676.12s)]
*  the friendship between Victor and Austin feels very similar to the, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1678.12s)]
*  or not similar, but it reminds me it has resonances of the friendship [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1681.1599999999999s)]
*  between Sam, your character, and somebody somewhere, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1685.1599999999999s)]
*  and Joel, her best friend. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  And I wonder too, like, is there anyone in your real life [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1689.1599999999999s)]
*  where you read this essay and you're thinking about, you know, this friend? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1692.1599999999999s)]
*  Specifically, no. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1698.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's somebody when it comes to Joel that reminds me, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, I did have what I thought was this person [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  and then, you know, they, and they're still, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1707.2s)]
*  we're still very close, still one of my best friends. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1711.2s)]
*  But, you know, I miss that, you know, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1714.2s)]
*  because then, you know, he's in a relationship now and it just changes [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1717.2s)]
*  and Sam says that to Joel, like, it's never going to, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1720.2s)]
*  it's not going to be the same. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1723.2s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you can't, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1725.2s)]
*  you know, we still have a very valuable relationship, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1727.2s)]
*  but I just think this was that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1730.2s)]
*  Huh, and it changed. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1734.2s)]
*  And it changed. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1735.24s)]
*  You know, it's so interesting that you said, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1737.24s)]
*  and that's okay. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1739.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, how did you, yeah, of course it's okay and, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1741.24s)]
*  I was awful when it did, but, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1743.24s)]
*  It's so interesting what you're saying because as much as you're willing to share, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1745.24s)]
*  I feel like that's something I can relate to, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1748.24s)]
*  I think many listeners can relate to, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1750.24s)]
*  and you said it's really freaking hard. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1752.24s)]
*  How did you get through that? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1754.24s)]
*  Like, what did you tell yourself? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1756.24s)]
*  I mean, it took me a long time. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1758.24s)]
*  I was really reactive, you know, reactionary and immature, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1760.24s)]
*  and like, but he, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1763.28s)]
*  and you know, and at first they kind of disappeared together, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1765.28s)]
*  and that's also okay. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1769.28s)]
*  Like, I understand both sides of it, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1771.28s)]
*  like why you want to get lost in a romantic relationship, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1773.28s)]
*  and you know, you think your friends are always going to be there, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1777.28s)]
*  but I've kind of always been that person for people. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1779.28s)]
*  I've always kind of been like, she'll be there. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1782.28s)]
*  And after a while you start to kind of, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1784.28s)]
*  it affects you, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1788.28s)]
*  and like, it's like, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1790.32s)]
*  you don't want to feel like the second or third string, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1792.32s)]
*  you know, it's just like, you can't help but feel that way. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1796.32s)]
*  But I also don't think that, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1798.32s)]
*  that just because somebody's in a romantic relationship, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1800.32s)]
*  that that means that you can't be a focal, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1803.32s)]
*  you know, a, I'm trying to think of the right word. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1807.32s)]
*  Yeah, a focal point in their life. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1809.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're just not the only one anymore. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1811.32s)]
*  Yeah, and so you have to kind of acclimate and adjust, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1813.32s)]
*  and sometimes you need your friend to let you know [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1816.32s)]
*  that, you know, they have this new wonderful romantic relationship [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1820.32s)]
*  and great, and I am happy for my friend, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1825.32s)]
*  and Sam is happy for Joel, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1829.32s)]
*  but like, you know, sometimes you need to know [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1831.32s)]
*  that you matter, you know? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1835.32s)]
*  It's accepting that you might not always be as primary to someone [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1839.32s)]
*  as they are to you. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1843.32s)]
*  Yeah, and the truth is, a lot of my friendships are like, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1845.32s)]
*  you know, if I ask them to do something, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1847.32s)]
*  they're like, well, let me check with, you know, so and so first, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1848.36s)]
*  and I understand that you have a life together. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1851.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1853.36s)]
*  But it does make, if everybody's around you is kind of like that, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1855.36s)]
*  then you start to feel like, well, I'm just like, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1858.36s)]
*  you know, I'm here when it's convenient for other people, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1860.36s)]
*  and it hurts. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1863.36s)]
*  So seeing something like this is like, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1865.36s)]
*  it just is, it's a dream, and it gives me a lot of hope. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1867.36s)]
*  I love what you said that, you know, I asked you, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1870.36s)]
*  what can you do as the friend who feels like the backup or whatever, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1873.36s)]
*  and what you said is, it's really good for them to let you know [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1876.3999999999999s)]
*  you matter. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1880.3999999999999s)]
*  It's to be reminded. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  It feels like it's always up to the person that's like, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1884.3999999999999s)]
*  unattached, that's unattached to kind of adapt and sort of, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  and you do, and you should, obviously. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1889.3999999999999s)]
*  But I don't know, I'm probably being selfish, but I, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1893.3999999999999s)]
*  I do not think you're being selfish at all. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1897.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's not all these people and refresh it. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, put it on, be like, I said it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1902.3999999999999s)]
*  No, but I think that's so, it's kind of a perfect distillation. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1903.44s)]
*  I mean, a simple one, but I think a true one of what friendship can be. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1908.44s)]
*  It's just looking someone in the eyes and saying, you matter. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1912.44s)]
*  You matter to me. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1916.44s)]
*  You will always matter to me. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1918.44s)]
*  Yeah, that feels to me like that is what friendship is. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1920.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there, you know, something like that happens [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1922.44s)]
*  in the season with Sam and Joel and Mike, and, and she needs it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1925.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1929.44s)]
*  And can you describe a moment where you really felt sure that you matter to a friend? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1930.48s)]
*  Like, was there something someone did or said where you felt that? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1938.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think my friends know that I, you know, they, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1942.48s)]
*  they tell me they love me. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1947.48s)]
*  I know that they do. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1950.48s)]
*  But it's also up to me to hear it, you know, and that's... [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1956.48s)]
*  So what do you mean by that? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1960.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1962.48s)]
*  I have to be able to take it in. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1967.48s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's, it's challenging sometimes. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1970.48s)]
*  I was just with Mary Katherine who plays Trisha, my sister on the show, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1976.48s)]
*  and we used to be roommates and, you know, and, and she said something to me. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1979.48s)]
*  She's like, she's like, you know, I love you, right? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1983.48s)]
*  And I was like, it's like, you know, I'd had a couple of margarinis [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1985.48s)]
*  and I was like, don't, don't try to unpack my, me right now. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1988.52s)]
*  But she's, you know, she's a great friend and she's always done a lot. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=1994.52s)]
*  My friend Zach has really invested a lot of time into making me hear it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2000.52s)]
*  So, and I think that's kind of the most important part that you have to, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2007.52s)]
*  you have to let it in. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2013.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not easy. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2016.52s)]
*  You know what I'm thinking too with, with, you know, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2018.52s)]
*  people have expectations when we get older and we enter into romantic relationships [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2021.52s)]
*  that like friendship will become less important, right? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2026.52s)]
*  It's just like lower down on the hierarchy. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2029.52s)]
*  It's less important than, you know, your spouse or your kids or your job or whatever. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2031.52s)]
*  A whole host of things. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2036.52s)]
*  Right? How can we cultivate close friendships in our adulthood [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2038.52s)]
*  when there's so much else competing for our time or for our friend's time? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2041.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2045.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2046.56s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that the, you know, my dream is to, to be, to have a central, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2048.56s)]
*  you know, be central in a friend's life again. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2055.56s)]
*  And, and I don't know, I just, I love all my friends. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2058.56s)]
*  I don't want them to listen to this and think anything, you know, less than that. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2064.56s)]
*  But, well, my friends are making me a priority. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2069.56s)]
*  It matters. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2074.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2076.6s)]
*  Because it is like all those things you say, like, there's just, life sweeps people up [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2078.6s)]
*  and, and sometimes the friendships, you know, they become a backseat [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2083.6s)]
*  and it's not that way for Sam and Joel. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2089.6s)]
*  And that's what I love. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2091.6s)]
*  I feel like it's fantasy. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2093.6s)]
*  And it's so true that it's, it's so clear, rather, that it's, it's not that way. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2095.6s)]
*  For you. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2100.64s)]
*  And I think, I mean, not together, you know, but cheesy with it, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4qFviPInY&t=2102.64s)]
