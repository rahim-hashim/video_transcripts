# Nancy Pelosi Insists the Election Was Not a Rebuke of the Democrats
**New York Times - The Interview:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594)
*  LULU GARCIA-NEVARRO From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia-Nevarro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=6.28s)]
*  Perhaps no Democratic politician has been a greater antagonist of Donald Trump than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=12.16s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=17.6s)]
*  As the leader of the House Democrats between 2007 and 2023, she participated in two Trump [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=19.3s)]
*  impeachments, memorably ripped up a copy of Trump's last State of the Union after he delivered [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=25.6s)]
*  it and had an angry mob on January 6th hunting for her inside the Capitol. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=30.44s)]
*  And over the summer, it was Pelosi who was reportedly a key voice in convincing Biden [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=36.52s)]
*  to step down and give another Democrat a shot at beating Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, we all know now how that story ended. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=46.28s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a stinging loss in Tuesday's election. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=49.24s)]
*  Democrats regained control of the Senate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=54.28s)]
*  And even though the House has yet to be called for either party, the strength of the GOP's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=56.52s)]
*  turnout is undeniable, as Republicans made inroads in heavily Democratic areas across [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=67.56s)]
*  Now Trump is the president-elect, with a sweeping mandate and promises to undo many of Pelosi [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=69.08s)]
*  and the Democrats' legislative achievements. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=75.16s)]
*  In her first extended interview since her party's defeat, Pelosi sat down with me at [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  the Times offices in Washington, D.C. on Thursday evening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=82.68s)]
*  You know, we're trying to win the House right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  And she seemed to still be coming to terms with what had happened. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  So, oh my gosh, it's wild. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Even as Democrats point fingers over who exactly is to blame, Pelosi seemed unwilling to concede [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=96.5s)]
*  that her party had been handed a crushing electoral rebuke, and she rejected criticism [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  of the Democrats' direction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=107.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's my interview with Speaker of Merida, Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=110.12s)]
*  First of all, obviously a huge disappointment for you and the Democrats. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=119.92s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=124.68s)]
*  On the presidential level, I feel sad for the American people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=126.48s)]
*  The policies that have been put forth by the president-to-be are some that are very, shall [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=130.44s)]
*  we say, if the first term is any indication, it's going to favor the very rich at the expense [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=137.12s)]
*  of working families. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=142.52s)]
*  From a political standpoint, I'm very proud of Kamala Harris. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=144.16s)]
*  I think she did an excellent job putting forth an agenda for the future. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=149.44s)]
*  A person that is not only a to-do list, but a substantial to-do list for the American [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=154.72s)]
*  people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=161.8s)]
*  And she gave us hope with dignity and grace, and I'm very proud of her candidacy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=162.94s)]
*  The people have spoken. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=169.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has won. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=171.38s)]
*  And now we will have a peaceful transfer of power in our country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  You were at Harris's concession speech on Wednesday afternoon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=178.92s)]
*  Have you spoken to her since the election, and what was that conversation like, and what [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  is she feeling at this moment? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=186.5s)]
*  Yes, I've spoken to her. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=188.38s)]
*  I've told her how proud we are of her, and thank her for again giving us hope with great [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=189.78s)]
*  dignity. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=194.1s)]
*  Obviously, it takes time to absorb an election. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=195.1s)]
*  It takes actually a while to understand how certain things have happened, but they did [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=201.4s)]
*  happen and she accepts that, and she's my personal friend as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=207.44s)]
*  For me, it was emotional to have to have the conversation in a way that was praiseworthy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=214.38s)]
*  of her patriotic leadership, but sad for her personally. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=220.48s)]
*  When you say emotional, what does that mean exactly? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=225.78s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=229.94s)]
*  We're talking about the presidency of the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=230.94s)]
*  We're talking about a person who is a good person, a person who cares about people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=233.62s)]
*  That's why she's in the civic arena. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=241.1s)]
*  Then politically, very astute, you don't get to be the nominee of the party unless [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=243.6s)]
*  you know your politics. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=248.64s)]
*  We are on the verge. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=250.44s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=251.44s)]
*  I know that it looked like a very red outcome yesterday, but we are on the verge of perhaps [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=252.44s)]
*  winning the House and making Hakeem Jeffries the Speaker of the House. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=257.48s)]
*  There are votes to be counted in Arizona, Oregon, and California, and we're optimistic [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=261.4s)]
*  that we can win. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=268.68s)]
*  You might win the House, but you definitely lost the presidency. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=270.92s)]
*  You lost the Senate. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=274.44s)]
*  There is a good chance that the GOP remains in control in the House. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=276.56s)]
*  There's already been a lot of parsing of what happened, and I know that there's going to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=282.48s)]
*  be a lot to come. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  What is your main takeaway from that terrible night for the Democrats? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=289.22s)]
*  Well, it was not a good night for the Democrats, but as I say, I don't accept right now, and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=293.56s)]
*  we won't even know by the time this goes to print what the outcome is of the House races. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=299.8s)]
*  But understand this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=306.2s)]
*  The big assault that was made, this big red map across America, we lost two of our incumbents, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=307.76s)]
*  maybe three. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=315.72s)]
*  We're still waiting to hear from one in Alaska, but that was a big save. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=316.72s)]
*  I mean, what we call our frontline candidates, by and large, won in places where the Republicans [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=321.0s)]
*  were raging with their vote for the president and the Senate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  The House members did very well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=333.92s)]
*  As I say, it's still a possibility that we can win, but just that it's a possibility [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  tells you that the House ran against the tide. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Already we have started organizing for the future. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=347.26s)]
*  We don't agonize over what happened. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=350.32s)]
*  We organize about what comes next. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=352.14s)]
*  But I do think it's important to discuss a little bit about what you think could have [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=355.08s)]
*  been done differently. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=360.2s)]
*  And a lot of the discussion has centered around how much President Biden's delay in deciding [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=362.08s)]
*  to leave the race following the debate in June hurt the VP's campaign. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=368.96s)]
*  You were very involved in encouraging him to leave, and there's reporting that you were [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=374.08s)]
*  concerned about him being the candidate well before the debate in June. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=378.56s)]
*  And polls were showing that the American people were very concerned about President Biden's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=383.16s)]
*  age and his ability to lead into another term. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=388.68s)]
*  Do you wish you'd gotten involved earlier than you did? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  No, I, well, the president made his own decision to step aside and to endorse Kamala Harris, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=396.12s)]
*  who made a patriotic, selfless decision for which we are all very grateful. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=404.48s)]
*  I think that was one of the reasons we were able to save so many House seats. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=409.92s)]
*  So I thank him for that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=414.8s)]
*  I had no reason to earlier say anything to the president. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=416.56s)]
*  I would have wished that they had in the first two years of the president's term been more [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=421.64s)]
*  out there about what we had accomplished. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=428.16s)]
*  The rescue package, money in people's pockets, shots in their arms, people back to work, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  children safely back to school. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=437.44s)]
*  The Biden child tax credit, all those things, there would have been more of presentation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=439.08s)]
*  of that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=444.0s)]
*  I was not asking the president to step aside. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=445.28s)]
*  What I was asking the president to do is to have the campaign be more clear. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  Do you think he should have ever run for a second term? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=452.56s)]
*  Well, that's a whole other conversation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=456.0s)]
*  The decisions that people make, I just say this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=461.64s)]
*  The president is the president. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  The candidates for president have their campaigns. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=468.24s)]
*  But we, as the rest of us, have to mobilize at the grassroots level to own the ground [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=471.44s)]
*  so they win. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=475.64s)]
*  We have to have a message that has clarity and unity to it and not divisiveness just [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=476.88s)]
*  in terms of alienating people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  And third, the money to get the job done. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=487.76s)]
*  We did all that we needed to to win the House as well as the White House. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=490.24s)]
*  It's up to the candidate for president to make his or her own decision about timing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  policy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=500.0s)]
*  Do you think the timing hobbled Kamala Harris because she had a hundred days to get a campaign [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=501.0s)]
*  off the ground, to mobilize people, to get her message across, to get her self-known? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this was an incredibly truncated campaign. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=513.0s)]
*  And many people think that maybe she was set up to fail just by the timeline alone. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=518.84s)]
*  Oh, I don't think she was set up to fail. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=522.84s)]
*  But let me just say this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=524.48s)]
*  We are only a couple of days since the election. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=525.48s)]
*  There will be many reviews of timing and the who, what, when and why and where as we go [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=528.48s)]
*  forward. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  And books will be written about it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=536.96s)]
*  The fact is, she did a great job with the time constraint that she had. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=539.1600000000001s)]
*  Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  Kamala, I think, still would have won, but she may have been stronger having taken her [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=550.2s)]
*  case to the public sooner. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=555.2s)]
*  You've talked about your interest in having had an open primary. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=558.76s)]
*  And as you know, it would have uncovered her weaknesses or strengths. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  It would have tested her electability. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=567.52s)]
*  That's what the primary system is intended to do. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=569.36s)]
*  And it would have also perhaps resulted in a nominee that wasn't so tied to an unpopular [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=573.16s)]
*  president. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=577.92s)]
*  It's interesting that you say those things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't think that any review of the election should be pedicated on weaknesses, but strengths [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=582.12s)]
*  of Kamala Harris. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  She gave people hope. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=592.0s)]
*  She caused a great deal of excitement in all of this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=594.0s)]
*  It's about winning. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  You don't have to tell me that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  But the fact is, we're set up for what comes next. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=600.16s)]
*  Should there have been an open primary, though? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=603.4s)]
*  See, we thought that there would be. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=605.08s)]
*  The anticipation was that if the president were to step aside, that there would be an [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=608.12s)]
*  open primary. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=614.48s)]
*  And as I say, Kamala may have... [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=615.48s)]
*  I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=618.48s)]
*  But we don't know that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=622.04s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=624.28s)]
*  We live with what happened. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=625.48s)]
*  And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=627.48s)]
*  impossible to have a primary at that time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=633.84s)]
*  If it had been much earlier, it would have been different. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=637.04s)]
*  But we're not here to agonize. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=639.68s)]
*  We're here again to organize on how we go forward. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=641.88s)]
*  We're going to have fresh, new talent, perhaps Kamala among them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=645.04s)]
*  That's up to her to go forward for the next election. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  But I think people need a little rest from elections right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=653.6s)]
*  We're still fighting to win the House, so we're not finished with our race. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=656.64s)]
*  It's a pretty exciting road ahead, and time goes by quite quickly. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=661.6s)]
*  I'm sympathetic to the desire to move on from what is a very difficult moment. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=667.36s)]
*  I do, though, feel like the Democratic electorate is looking for some reflection now and some [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  understanding of how things ended up the way that they did. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=678.52s)]
*  And when you look at what happened on Tuesday, you can see it in two ways. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=682.72s)]
*  You can see that the country embraced Trump, or you can see that they rejected the Democratic [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=689.2s)]
*  Party more broadly and the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=695.48s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't see the Democratic Party more broadly. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  We lost two seats in the House, and we expect to pick up some more to offset that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  Right now, we're about even. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  So I don't think whatever you said, with all due respect, applies to the House Democrats. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=709.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, though, that the way that the House runs is different than you run a national [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  campaign, right? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=719.0s)]
*  House races are run very locally. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=720.0s)]
*  They message specifically for their district. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=722.96s)]
*  But the brand of the Democratic Party overall seems to have been hurt this election cycle. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=726.44s)]
*  Well, I think we lost the presidential election, and in many cases, our Democrats in the House [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=732.08s)]
*  ran ahead of the presidential ticket. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=738.64s)]
*  So you're branding that we all got rejected. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=742.4s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=745.24s)]
*  We're still in the fight right now, and it's going to be a very close call. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=746.24s)]
*  I don't see it as an outright rejection of the Democratic Party. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=751.16s)]
*  Now, I do have a discomfort level with some of the Democrats right now who are saying, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=755.04s)]
*  oh, we abandoned the working class. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=761.0s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=764.12s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=765.12s)]
*  We are the kitchen table working class party of America. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=766.52s)]
*  That's why we're a close call in the House right now in a year where the map is a bright [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  red across the board. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=777.44s)]
*  I want to pick up on this working class issue because in a statement after the election, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders said it should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=787.36s)]
*  which has abandoned working class people, would find that working class people have [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=791.08s)]
*  abandoned them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=794.96s)]
*  Joe Manchin, who's now an independent but was an important moderate Democrat for years, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=796.32s)]
*  also weighed in and had a similar diagnosis of what went wrong. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=802.1600000000001s)]
*  That was that the party doesn't stand for what it used to. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=806.96s)]
*  I just completely disagree. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=809.88s)]
*  In fact, you might notice that Kamala Harris ran ahead of Bernie Sanders in Vermont. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=811.6400000000001s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  It tells you that the fact is that what we do, what our purpose is in the Democratic [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  Party, is for America's working families. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  So I think you pursue it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  Go ask Bernie Sanders. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=831.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has not won. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  Let me, with all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him, for what he [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=839.0s)]
*  working class families. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=844.8s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  For example, under President Biden, you see the rescue package, money in the pockets of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  people, shots in the arm, children in school safely, working people back to work. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  What did Trump do when he was president? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=860.64s)]
*  One bill that gave a tax cut to the richest people in America. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=864.52s)]
*  In fact- [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=868.56s)]
*  Then why did voters who earned less than $100,000 go for Trump in such large numbers? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=869.56s)]
*  Well, there are cultural issues involved in elections as well. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=875.92s)]
*  Guns, gods, and gays. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=879.3599999999999s)]
*  That's the way they say it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=881.28s)]
*  Guns? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=882.88s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=883.88s)]
*  Gays? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=884.88s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=885.88s)]
*  Now they're making the trans issue such an important issue and their priorities. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=886.88s)]
*  In certain communities, what they call God, what we call a woman's right to choose. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=893.68s)]
*  So you feel like it was the culture war issue that- [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=898.68s)]
*  I think that's part of it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=902.84s)]
*  Nothing is it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=904.52s)]
*  It's part of it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=905.52s)]
*  Because it's really hard to understand how someone would vote for somebody like Trump [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=906.52s)]
*  for the wealthiest people. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=911.88s)]
*  And again, I think the message that Bernie Sanders has put out is not the winning message [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=913.88s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=919.96s)]
*  I love him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=921.24s)]
*  I think he's great. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=922.24s)]
*  He's been a wonderful, shall we say, champion for his point of view. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=923.56s)]
*  But for his point of view is not correct when he says the Democrats have abandoned the working [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=929.52s)]
*  families. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=936.28s)]
*  Same thing with Manchin. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=937.28s)]
*  I love Manchin. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=938.28s)]
*  We have our Italian-American Catholic connection and we've worked together, but we have not [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=939.68s)]
*  abandoned working families. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=945.4s)]
*  Most of the voters though said that they voted on the economy and inflation and immigration. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  These were the main issues. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=954.64s)]
*  Those aren't cultural issues. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=955.64s)]
*  Those are policy issues. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=956.64s)]
*  Well, immigration is a cultural issue. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=957.64s)]
*  There's immigration a cultural issue when the candidate for president is saying that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=960.64s)]
*  these people coming in are murderers, rapists, thieves, and all the rest of that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=964.12s)]
*  He made that a cultural issue. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=969.84s)]
*  The immigration issue. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=971.96s)]
*  But there were millions of people that came in through the border at a time. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=973.96s)]
*  And he said there were criminals and they weren't. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=980.32s)]
*  People felt quite strongly that they didn't want to see immigrants sleeping in police [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=981.32s)]
*  stations at airports. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=986.6s)]
*  I don't think we were clear enough by saying fewer people came in under President Biden [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=987.88s)]
*  than came under Donald Trump. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=992.76s)]
*  See that it's clarity of the message. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=995.48s)]
*  And if that's what Bernie's talking about and that's what Joe Manchin is talking about, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=997.36s)]
*  we weren't clear in our message as to what things are, then I agree with that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1001.0s)]
*  And that was one of the concerns I expressed about saying we haven't put forth what was [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1005.76s)]
*  done. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1012.32s)]
*  It's our legacy too. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1012.88s)]
*  The rescue package. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1015.8000000000001s)]
*  Infrastructure bill. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1018.72s)]
*  The CHIPS Act. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1020.44s)]
*  But that didn't come across as well as it should have. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  So I think if you're talking about messaging, you're talking about communications, that's [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1025.36s)]
*  one thing. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1029.36s)]
*  If you're talking about what we stand for versus what they stand for, the public's in [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1030.24s)]
*  for a big surprise. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1034.6s)]
*  I didn't come here today to go through the list of grievances against Donald Trump. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1036.08s)]
*  He's now the president. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  We wish our country well under the leadership of any president. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1044.36s)]
*  But we will disagree with him where we disagree and try to find common ground where that exists. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1048.44s)]
*  We have that responsibility to the American people. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  But there's nothing in evidence of what he has done before when he says Obamacare sucks [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1058.28s)]
*  and he's going to get rid of that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1063.4s)]
*  They might even get rid of the CHIPS Act, which is a big jobs issue in our country. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1064.88s)]
*  So we have, again, I'm not here to take him down. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1069.96s)]
*  He won the election. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1073.4s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1074.76s)]
*  Good luck to him there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1076.16s)]
*  But hopefully we can find common ground. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1077.44s)]
*  I do just want to make sure I'm understanding where you're at in this moment. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1080.96s)]
*  You say the Democrats had a strong case for working class voters. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1085.52s)]
*  And do you say Kamala Harris was not especially weighed down by Biden's record? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1089.64s)]
*  And I didn't say that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1096.6000000000001s)]
*  So do you feel that Kamala Harris was weighed down by Biden's record or the perception of [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1097.4s)]
*  Biden's record? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that any vice president is, like it or not, tied to the record of the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1101.72s)]
*  president. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1107.2s)]
*  I think what Biden did was great. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1108.2s)]
*  And being tied to his record is a great thing, but not the way the record was perceived. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1111.6000000000001s)]
*  This is a record of job creation, 16 million jobs, as opposed to the record of her opponent, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  who had the worst job creation record since Herbert Hoover. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1123.84s)]
*  Yes, 16 million jobs. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1128.2s)]
*  Turning around inflation, all the things that we did to build the infrastructure of [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1131.52s)]
*  America, to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1135.84s)]
*  Should she have taken a page out of your book, which is, I remember when you were Speaker [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1138.76s)]
*  of the House, you would always tell all of the people running, you can run against me, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1143.52s)]
*  you can cuss me out, you can disavow me as long as you win your race. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1149.48s)]
*  Do you think she should have taken that tack with Biden? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1154.24s)]
*  Let me just say this about the presidential. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1157.2s)]
*  The presidential is a very special banner to carry. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1159.92s)]
*  I never advise presidential candidates on what they should be doing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1167.24s)]
*  The presidency is a different initiative. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1172.76s)]
*  So I have never, I'm not going to start today giving presidents advice. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1176.64s)]
*  Many things can be said about you, but you are a brilliant tactician and a brilliant [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1182.04s)]
*  political mind. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1186.6000000000001s)]
*  I would rather say strategist than technician. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1187.6s)]
*  Okay, strategist. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  So then as a strategy, should she not have tried to differentiate herself? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  She was tagged as being an extension of President Biden. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1197.8s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1204.32s)]
*  Do you think that the Republican candidate for president and his campaign would have [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1205.9599999999998s)]
*  let it, oh, okay. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1212.9199999999998s)]
*  No, they were going to be advertising against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1215.0400000000002s)]
*  So it's not a question of what she would do. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1221.7600000000002s)]
*  It's a question of how they would present it anyway. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1225.0s)]
*  That's why I leave it up to them. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  They have the intelligence from the campaigns. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1230.74s)]
*  They have the talent out there to do the job. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1235.6200000000001s)]
*  And I respect Kamala Harris as our candidate for president. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1240.08s)]
*  What does it say to you that many parts of the electorate didn't find the argument put [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1245.08s)]
*  forward about democracy being so important, about what happened on January 6th being disqualifying, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1250.36s)]
*  about many of the egregious examples of Trump's rhetoric being offensive. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1257.0s)]
*  Ultimately, it didn't change their vote. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think it was a question of changing their vote. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1265.76s)]
*  I think that's where they were. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1267.8s)]
*  Now, the fact of January 6th, that was an assault on our Congress, assault on the Capitol, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1269.56s)]
*  the beacon of democracy to the world, an assault on the Constitution of the United States. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1276.12s)]
*  It was an insurrection instigated by the president of the United States. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1281.8s)]
*  They knew how bad it was. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1285.34s)]
*  That's why they had to have revisionist history to change the story. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1287.08s)]
*  And that's really shameful. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1291.6s)]
*  I bless Liz Cheney for speaking out on Adam Kinzinger and speaking out on all that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1293.12s)]
*  Why do you think, though, the American voters didn't care? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1299.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, you have to ask the American voters because I think sometimes I think when I'm [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1301.8s)]
*  talking, listening to them, that they're saying American democracy is very strong. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  It can withstand anything. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1311.6s)]
*  Well, I hope they're right. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1312.9599999999998s)]
*  And that's what I've listened to. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1314.8s)]
*  How Americans have never experienced democratic backsliding as you've seen in other countries [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1316.56s)]
*  and they just sort of discounted the argument? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1324.2s)]
*  Some of them. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1328.04s)]
*  I have great confidence in the American people. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1329.04s)]
*  I believe by and large, they're patriotic. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1331.36s)]
*  They care about our Constitution and that they are good people. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  And an election is an election, but I do believe that we'll have an opportunity now to show [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1338.36s)]
*  a distinction when they see what comes down the pike and hopefully it'll be not so harmful. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1345.48s)]
*  And so I don't know that we can label everybody as saying everybody thought that democracy [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1351.6s)]
*  was not at risk. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1358.52s)]
*  No, plenty of people did. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1359.52s)]
*  Plenty of people did. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1361.52s)]
*  A lot of Democrats stayed home. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1363.68s)]
*  That's what the numbers show, that there wasn't as robust turnout as had been hoped. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1365.92s)]
*  Why do you think that was? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1370.98s)]
*  Well, in some places it was because there weren't really races. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1371.98s)]
*  In other words, they use example of some big cities. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1375.0s)]
*  There were no races that mattered in terms of who would be president. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1377.9599999999998s)]
*  It was clear in their state and that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1382.0s)]
*  And also in terms of Congress and other races, there was clearly going to be democratic. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1384.72s)]
*  So some people were not motivated to turn out. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1391.76s)]
*  But that's not unusual. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1395.12s)]
*  Do you worry though about what you're seeing in California, New York, big democratic strongholds? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1396.9199999999998s)]
*  It saw quite a bit of erosion. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1402.36s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the competitive house races are in California. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1404.2s)]
*  Does that, when you look at the map, does it concern you? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1407.52s)]
*  New York picked up four seats in the past nine months. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1409.56s)]
*  Picked up four democratic seats in the last nine months. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1413.0s)]
*  Tom Swasey to begin with earlier in the year, but three Tuesday night picked up three democratic [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1415.8s)]
*  seats in New York. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1421.3999999999999s)]
*  So no, I'm not worried about that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1422.3999999999999s)]
*  But President Trump performed 20 percentage points better in the Bronx and Queens than [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1424.6s)]
*  he did in 2020. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1430.02s)]
*  So I guess my question is, is this the Trump effect that he is just a uniquely popular [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1431.52s)]
*  person or is this something that the Democrats aren't doing right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1437.48s)]
*  No, we did it right. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  We won four seats in New York. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1445.12s)]
*  But I'm asking you about this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1447.2s)]
*  And that means you focus where you need to focus to win. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1448.2s)]
*  And the focus was in those seats. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1452.54s)]
*  And state of New York knew it was going to go for the Democrat. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1455.48s)]
*  It was going to go for Kamala Harris. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1459.64s)]
*  So within the state, we were focusing on how we increase the number of house races. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  So we go to those districts and we go to those districts and we won those districts. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1468.5800000000002s)]
*  But what does that shift, it doesn't concern you in the Bronx and Queens? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1475.0800000000002s)]
*  From one race to the other, it just depends on what the issues are that are there. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1479.88s)]
*  I think what we were told in the last election in New York is that safety was a big issue [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1484.84s)]
*  and the emphasis was not as strong as it should have been. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1491.12s)]
*  But you have to talk to the New Yorkers about their district. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1495.52s)]
*  I'm just so proud of them. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1498.8s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, he will be speaker either in a few days or in a couple years. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1500.1999999999998s)]
*  But I think it will be in a few days. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1505.9599999999998s)]
*  And he did a masterful job in New York in this election. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1508.1s)]
*  After the break, I talked to Speaker Emerita Pelosi about the mood of the party and the path forward. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1515.84s)]
*  Yeah, we don't like losing. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  And there are people who professionally go around saying what Bernie said and what some [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1525.56s)]
*  press say. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1530.32s)]
*  But I don't think it's ugly in the Democratic Party now at all. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1531.32s)]
*  You yourself were re-elected on Tuesday. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1544.84s)]
*  Congratulations to your 20th term, which is extraordinary. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1555.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm very proud of that. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1562.9199999999998s)]
*  Is it your last term? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1564.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not here to talk about that. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1566.04s)]
*  I'm here to fight the fight so that we win in the next election. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1568.1999999999998s)]
*  I must have thought I've had a last term over and over again in time myself. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1572.84s)]
*  But as fate would have it, the mission called. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1577.6399999999999s)]
*  Some of Trump's actual last words on the campaign were about you. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1583.12s)]
*  He called you evil, sick, crazy. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1587.08s)]
*  He called you the B-word and then stopped himself. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1591.22s)]
*  He's promised to prosecute you and other Democrats if re-elected. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1595.48s)]
*  Are you concerned that he's going to make good on his threat? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1600.7s)]
*  I'm concerned about what his presidency means to the everyday life of the American people. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1603.26s)]
*  That is why we're here, for the people. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1609.8600000000001s)]
*  So again, if I was concerned about what he said about me, that's been going on since [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1613.38s)]
*  what 2016. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1618.7s)]
*  What I am concerned about is what it means when he says with his project 2025 that he's [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1622.38s)]
*  going to eliminate the Department of Education, that he's going to take over the Department [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1627.98s)]
*  of Justice, that he's going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1635.14s)]
*  And now they're saying even the TIPPS Act. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1640.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what concerns me. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1644.5800000000002s)]
*  If I were concerned about what he says about me, what would be my worth if I cared about [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1645.76s)]
*  what he said about me? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1653.38s)]
*  Well, we should say that your husband, Paul Pelosi, whom I know a little because we serve [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1655.46s)]
*  on a university board together, and he was the victim of political violence. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1660.5s)]
*  So I imagine that threats against you ring differently now because of that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1665.1599999999999s)]
*  The thing that's so sad about that is they violated the sanctity of our home, the safety [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1668.4199999999998s)]
*  of my husband, looking for me. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1677.12s)]
*  Where is Nancy? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1680.02s)]
*  Where is Nancy echoing what was said on January 6th in the Capitol when they were coming after [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1681.22s)]
*  me to put a bullet in my head? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1687.02s)]
*  And he was going to punish me for what I had said about Donald Trump. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1690.68s)]
*  So yeah, that's of concern. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1695.78s)]
*  It's concerned to me because of what happened to my husband when they were looking for me. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  What was sad about it, too, for my children, my grandchildren, my husband, and for me was [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1704.18s)]
*  that President Trump thought it was funny. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1709.78s)]
*  He made a joke of it, as did his children, as did the Republican governor of Virginia, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1712.66s)]
*  as did Elon Musk. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1718.66s)]
*  They thought that was really funny, that he would get almost murdered by somebody hitting [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1720.42s)]
*  him over the head over the hammer. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1726.3s)]
*  And they thought that was funny. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1728.3s)]
*  And it's not funny, whether he thinks so or not. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1730.36s)]
*  It's not funny. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1733.94s)]
*  But it is serious. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1735.7s)]
*  And politics and government are the peaceful resolution of disagreement. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1738.42s)]
*  And disagreement is what a democracy is about. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1744.8400000000001s)]
*  So we don't expect everybody to think the same. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1748.38s)]
*  That's not what this is. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1751.22s)]
*  It's about having your differences of opinion. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1753.78s)]
*  As President Thomas Jefferson said, every difference of opinion is not a difference [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1758.14s)]
*  of conscience. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1762.8400000000001s)]
*  When you have a difference that is, then you have to stand your ground. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1764.6s)]
*  President Trump has promised to use the Justice Department and the Attorney General to go [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1769.28s)]
*  after his perceived enemies. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1774.8999999999999s)]
*  He has said that over and over again. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1776.56s)]
*  And you're one of them. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1778.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, you would think that that would be enough reason for people not to vote for him. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1779.48s)]
*  But that's what he said. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1783.72s)]
*  So when people say to me, why do you think our democracy is in danger, I'll say, well, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1785.12s)]
*  let's define our democracy. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1791.8s)]
*  What is democracy? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1794.0s)]
*  Free and fair elections, peaceful transfer of power, independence of the judiciary, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1795.32s)]
*  the rule of law, all of those kinds of things are part of a democracy. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1802.72s)]
*  So if he's going after those things, and thank God, the only, shall we say, peace of mind [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1809.8s)]
*  that we have today is that we don't have the assault on the system that it would have [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1818.64s)]
*  been there had Kamala Harris won. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1823.5200000000002s)]
*  That isn't right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1826.3200000000002s)]
*  It shouldn't be that way. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1827.72s)]
*  And that he would say, he would say, maybe thought it, might even want to do it, but [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1829.92s)]
*  to say it and the American people would say, that's okay with me. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1836.0400000000002s)]
*  But they did say it's okay with them because that's who they elected. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1841.4s)]
*  So I wonder if this has been a moment for you to reevaluate whether you think you actually [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1844.88s)]
*  understand this country. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1852.16s)]
*  No, I do. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1853.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1855.0400000000002s)]
*  I understand what was happening out there. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1856.0400000000002s)]
*  I've traveled the country quite a bit about it and see what is, look, I've been the target [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1857.0800000000002s)]
*  not just of him, but a lot of these people who are out there who don't like the fact [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1863.74s)]
*  that I criticize him. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1869.42s)]
*  But I think that we make a very big mistake if we underestimate the greatness of the American [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1871.62s)]
*  people and the greatness of our democracy and the greatness of our country. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1877.6999999999998s)]
*  So no, I don't think that at all. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1882.36s)]
*  We have elections, people make decisions, we go on to the next thing, and then we show [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1884.76s)]
*  the difference between the two parties and the other party that is involved in it and [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1890.26s)]
*  with great pride of what we stand for. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1896.9399999999998s)]
*  And that's what we have to point out is the difference. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1899.4s)]
*  And that's why I had my concerns earlier this year, that there wasn't enough clarification [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1901.96s)]
*  in the public mind as to what we set out to do. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1908.3600000000001s)]
*  We have to do that better next time. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1913.44s)]
*  I don't have to tell you that right now it's pretty ugly among Democrats. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1917.16s)]
*  There's a lot of blame going around. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1920.8200000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of reflection happening. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1924.7s)]
*  And there's a lot of discussion about how the party rebuilds after this and how does [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1927.8600000000001s)]
*  it not tear itself apart? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1931.7s)]
*  Well, I disagree. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1933.42s)]
*  I don't think it's very ugly among Democrats now. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1934.5s)]
*  Yeah, we don't like losing. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1937.1000000000001s)]
*  I was on a meeting this morning, which is I don't talk about what happens at a caucus [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1938.94s)]
*  meeting, but I can say it was unified and respectful of what the responsibilities that [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1943.22s)]
*  we have to go forward, praiseworthy of our leadership. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1950.3s)]
*  It was long and people took their time to tell how they saw things. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1954.18s)]
*  And it was, in my view, as unifying as I've ever seen it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1960.46s)]
*  It wasn't without concern. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1965.8200000000002s)]
*  It wasn't without wisdom and intelligence about what happened. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1968.02s)]
*  It wasn't Pollyanna-ish, but it was productive. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1971.6200000000001s)]
*  And it was about how we go forward to be bipartisan where we can, be transparent in all things [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1975.94s)]
*  and all cases, accountable to the public, but prepare to win the next time. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1984.14s)]
*  So yeah, we don't like losing. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1990.1000000000001s)]
*  And there are people who professionally go around saying what Bernie said and what some [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1992.3000000000002s)]
*  press say, but I don't think it's ugly in the Democratic Party now at all. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=1997.5800000000002s)]
*  I've traveled a lot and worked a lot in other countries. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2003.46s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of populist leaders. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2007.72s)]
*  And populists have this warping effect on the body politic because the opposition to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2010.82s)]
*  them gets distilled into just being against the populist leader as opposed to standing [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2018.9399999999998s)]
*  for something bigger. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you worry that the Democratic Party could be transformed into simply the anti-Trump [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2027.86s)]
*  Party? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2032.4199999999998s)]
*  And do you think that is what happened in this election? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2033.4199999999998s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2037.26s)]
*  I think some people perceived it that way, but that's perception. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2038.7s)]
*  I don't think that at all. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2043.1399999999999s)]
*  That's not our purpose. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2044.62s)]
*  Now I will say this in terms of your question. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2046.18s)]
*  Populism in this country and in some of those countries now is not just about populism in [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2049.98s)]
*  terms of an economic approach or something. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2056.18s)]
*  It's about xenophobic religious populism. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2059.54s)]
*  So there's something more, shall we say, to be concerned about, about what they're saying. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2066.18s)]
*  They're saying a religious Christian nationalist country. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2072.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, all of those words are a problem. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2076.7s)]
*  A religious country? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2079.54s)]
*  A nationalist country? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2081.02s)]
*  No. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2082.58s)]
*  So right now your question is a really important one because populism is one thing. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2083.58s)]
*  Xenophobic religious nationalist populism is dangerous. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2089.8599999999997s)]
*  That is what we have to make sure the public sees the difference in. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2094.98s)]
*  And you can't just say we have to accept religious populist xenophobic populism because food [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2099.66s)]
*  prices are lower. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2107.42s)]
*  If that's what this is about, where it's bad, as the richest people in America are saying, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2109.14s)]
*  I know Trump is whatever he is, but I just care about my tax return. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2114.14s)]
*  Billionaires, not all of them, of course. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2118.82s)]
*  I don't paint everybody with the same blood. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2121.06s)]
*  You're talking about Elon Musk and others. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2122.54s)]
*  You're talking about the conspicuous ones, but not only them. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2124.86s)]
*  So in any case, this is America's a great country. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2127.7000000000003s)]
*  The American people deserve the best we can give them. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2134.2200000000003s)]
*  The election was disappointing, heartbreaking in some ways because of not seeing what was [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2138.06s)]
*  really at stake. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2144.6200000000003s)]
*  But we don't blame them for that. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2146.1s)]
*  We have to be clear in our message. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2148.08s)]
*  And I'm a big believer in mobilization. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2151.2200000000003s)]
*  You can maneuver in Congress and government all you want. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2154.14s)]
*  And that's important. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2159.2999999999997s)]
*  But you cannot succeed unless you mobilize outside so that the people weigh in. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2160.72s)]
*  What is the plan with the Trump administration? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2167.14s)]
*  Would you advise Democrats to try and fight and be oppositional? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2169.54s)]
*  Or are you going to try and work with Republicans? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2176.3399999999997s)]
*  No, it's not a question of that. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2179.66s)]
*  We always try to work with Republicans. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2181.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a responsibility that we have. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2183.26s)]
*  It used to be that way until recent times, but it used to be that way that we always [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2185.5800000000004s)]
*  tried to find our common ground. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2191.6600000000003s)]
*  That was our responsibility and it still is. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2194.42s)]
*  But I will say this, where we disagree, we disagree. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2197.1000000000004s)]
*  He's twice impeached. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2199.94s)]
*  He's been legally tried. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2204.5800000000004s)]
*  I have to say the Supreme Court has been an embarrassment to our founders, just to have [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2207.18s)]
*  immunity for any president, whoever it might be, and to do so and take forever to do it [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2213.3399999999997s)]
*  so that justice could not be addressed one way or another. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2219.7s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2223.66s)]
*  I'm not here again. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2224.66s)]
*  My thoughts about Donald Trump are well known. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2227.14s)]
*  I'm not an admirer of his lack of patriotism and the rest. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2230.94s)]
*  But I'm not here to go into that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2235.1s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2237.06s)]
*  We all want the president to succeed. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2238.06s)]
*  We wanted him to succeed in 2016 until he went down a path that we had to disagree with. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2239.9s)]
*  But again, let's give this a chance and see where we can find our common ground. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2249.14s)]
*  We'll see what is rhetoric and what is real. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2253.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's see what materializes and we'll fight every fight along the way. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2255.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's no use going into his personal situation. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2260.7s)]
*  The public has ignored that, or enough of them have. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2266.62s)]
*  So that's that. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2270.74s)]
*  Let's just move on. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2271.74s)]
*  But we want to show the difference. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2273.42s)]
*  You're going to see it's going to be pretty exciting for what comes next in the Democratic [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2275.3s)]
*  Party. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSK2AR594&t=2280.86s)]
