# Isabel Allende on Grief, Fear and Her New Novel ‘My Name Is Emilia Del Valle’
**New York Times - The Interview:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA)
*  One thing has been always in my life, writing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=0.0s)]
*  At 82, Isabel Allende is one of the world's most beloved and best-selling Spanish language authors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=4.0s)]
*  Her work has been translated into more than 40 languages, and 80 million copies of her books have been sold around the world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=14.0s)]
*  Allende's newest book is called My Name is Emilia del Valle, and it's about a dark period in Chilean history. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=22.0s)]
*  It's the 1891 Chilean Civil War. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=28.0s)]
*  I look back all the time to what happened before in order to explain what's happening today in our lives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=31.0s)]
*  It's not that far off from Allende's own story. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=38.0s)]
*  She was raised in Chile, but in 1973, when she was 31 and working as a journalist with two small children, her life was upended forever. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=41.0s)]
*  It was then that a military coup pushed out the democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, who was her cousin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=50.0s)]
*  When I crossed the Andes in the plane, I cried in the plane because I knew somehow instinctively that everything had changed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=57.0s)]
*  She fled to Venezuela, where she wrote her first book, The House of the Spirits, which evolved from a letter she had started to her dying grandfather. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=66.0s)]
*  That book became a runaway bestseller, and it remains one of her best-known works. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=74.0s)]
*  I think that my way of getting over things, of understanding, of exploring my own soul, is writing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=79.0s)]
*  I'm Gilbert Cruz. Guest hosting this week, filling in for Lulu. Here's my interview with Isabel Allende. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=88.0s)]
*  Hello, Gilberto. Do you speak Spanish? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=99.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=101.0s)]
*  A little bit? With that name, you should speak Spanish. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=103.0s)]
*  Please, it is my great shame. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=107.0s)]
*  I know, you should be really embarrassed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=108.0s)]
*  Whenever I go back to see family in Puerto Rico, they give me the business all the time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=111.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=116.0s)]
*  I obviously want to talk to you about your new book, about your personal history, and of course about writing and creativity. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=118.0s)]
*  I think for you, all of these things, they all intertwine in many of your books, and they certainly do in your new novel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=126.0s)]
*  This is a book that is set in the 1890s. Your main character heads down to witness the Chilean Civil War that is happening there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=135.0s)]
*  I'm wondering what was going through your mind when you said, this is the time period, this is the event, and this is what I want my character to see. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=145.0s)]
*  I'm fascinated with history. Most of my schooling was done abroad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=154.0s)]
*  I studied very little Chilean history, but I have studied it as an adult. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=159.0s)]
*  I look back all the time to what happened before in order to explain what's happening today in our lives. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=167.0s)]
*  There are some parallels between what happened in 1891 when the president, José Manuel Balmaceda, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=174.0s)]
*  he was challenged by his economic and political enemies of the conservative party. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=184.0s)]
*  The Navy went with the opposition, and then they had a civil war. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=190.0s)]
*  It was brutal, brutal, bloody. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=195.0s)]
*  And it has some parallels what would happen in 1973 in Chile with Salvador Allende. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=198.0s)]
*  And so there was no civil war. There was really a brutal military coup, as we know. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=205.0s)]
*  But both presidents committed suicide. In both circumstances, many Chileans died. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=212.0s)]
*  So there were some historical parallels. So it was a fascinating idea to explore. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=219.0s)]
*  The main character, Emilia, she shares a last name, of course, with several other characters across your body of work, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=227.0s)]
*  including several in your first book, The House of the Spirits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=235.0s)]
*  Why does this name resonate with you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=239.0s)]
*  What are you trying to say by sort of threading this name or this family line throughout several of your books? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=242.0s)]
*  You know, some characters, like some people, never leave you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=249.0s)]
*  I wrote The House of the Spirits inspired by my relatives from my grandmother's side mostly. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=254.0s)]
*  And they were all lunatics and wonderful extravagant people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=263.0s)]
*  I call them Del Valle, but really their last name is Barros. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=268.0s)]
*  And so I picked up those characters, some of them, and there were many others there that I didn't have enough pages for them. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=273.0s)]
*  So they came back in other books. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=283.0s)]
*  Look, with relatives like mine, you don't need to invent anything. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=285.0s)]
*  So the Del Valle family will be haunting me forever. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, speaking of relatives, so your protagonist, Emilia, she doesn't have a relationship with her birth father. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=295.0s)]
*  She goes looking for him. I know you did not have a relationship with your birth father. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=302.0s)]
*  I'm curious about how your mother, Panchita, talked about your father when you were young and how you thought about him, if at all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=307.0s)]
*  She never spoke about him. All the photographs in which he appeared were destroyed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=316.0s)]
*  And there was never a mention of his name. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=322.0s)]
*  And when we asked, she would always say he was a very intelligent man. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=325.0s)]
*  That's it. She wouldn't say why he left, why we couldn't see him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=331.0s)]
*  No explanation. At some point, when they were teenagers, my brothers wanted to meet him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=337.0s)]
*  And it was a big disappointment for them because my father had absolutely no connection with them and no interest in them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=343.0s)]
*  But I never looked for them. And many years later, when I was working as a journalist, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=351.0s)]
*  I was called to the morgue to identify a body of a man that had died in the street. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=357.0s)]
*  And I couldn't identify him because I had never seen a picture of him. That was my father. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=363.0s)]
*  First of all, that sounds terrible. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=369.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't terrible because I mean, it was terrible to see a corpse for the first time. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=371.0s)]
*  But I didn't feel anything, any connection, any compassion, any longing of any kind. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=377.0s)]
*  Emilia, the reason I ask, also doesn't have a connection to her father for much of her life. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=386.0s)]
*  However, the scenes in the book when Emilia does finally meet her father, not to give away too many details, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=393.0s)]
*  I found quite moving. And I was wondering what it was like to write those scenes for you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=399.0s)]
*  I could put myself in her place. I suppose that if I have met my father and he was an old man, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=405.0s)]
*  sick, anxious, depressed, sad, fearing death, I would feel compassion and I would feel close to him. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=416.0s)]
*  But I never had that chance. So I don't know. But it was easy for me to imagine that she would behave like that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=426.0s)]
*  Because also she was very open-minded, Emilia. She was open to everything. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=433.0s)]
*  Emilia, well, she not surprisingly, given who you are, she bucks a lot of convention for women of her time period. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=438.0s)]
*  She writes gory dime novels about murder and vengeance. She goes on to become a war reporter. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=445.0s)]
*  You have written and you've said many times that you've been a feminist since you were a child [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=455.0s)]
*  because of the way that you saw your mother and women of your mother's generation treated when you were growing up in Chile. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=461.0s)]
*  And I wonder, over the course of your career, has it been purposeful to write your female characters in this way? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=470.0s)]
*  Or is it just like, this is the only way I know how to write women? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=482.0s)]
*  You know, it would be very hard for me to write a novel about a submissive wife in the suburbs that waits for her husband to come back from the job. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=486.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no story there. You really want your character. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=495.0s)]
*  Look, you cannot have characters with common sense. You cannot have characters who are like everybody else, who don't suffer. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=499.0s)]
*  The story is in the tragedy, in the drama, in the struggle, in the hero's journey. That's where the story is. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=507.0s)]
*  I write about women who are always challenging convention and get a lot of aggression for that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=514.0s)]
*  But they stand up and they are able to fend for themselves. Those are the characters I love. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=524.0s)]
*  And I write about them because I know them so well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=530.0s)]
*  And in many ways I can connect to that because I was born in a Catholic, conservative, authoritarian, patriarchal family in the 40s, in the middle of the Second World War. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=534.0s)]
*  Women of my generation and my social class were supposed to marry and have kids, and that's it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=548.0s)]
*  So to get out of that prison, really, of the mind was very challenging. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=555.0s)]
*  I belong to the first generation of women who were able, some of us, to do it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=565.0s)]
*  How old do you think you were when you realized it was a prison of sorts? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=570.0s)]
*  Teenager. When I was little, I didn't want to be dependent. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=575.0s)]
*  My mother says that when I was five or six, they would ask me, what would you like to do when you grow up? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=581.0s)]
*  And I would say, support myself. That was my answer. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=587.0s)]
*  Support myself. Because I realized that because my mother could not support herself, she depended on her father, her brother, other people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=592.0s)]
*  And that made her very vulnerable. I didn't want that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=602.0s)]
*  But then later, I sort of targeted male authority. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=606.0s)]
*  I realized that authority was always in the hands of men, the priests, the police, my grandfather. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=613.0s)]
*  It was always male. And then I rebelled against that, but it didn't have a name. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=621.0s)]
*  I didn't know that there was something called feminism. I had never heard the word. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=627.0s)]
*  And when I was in my late teens, then I heard about feminism and about the women's movement. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=632.0s)]
*  And I started reading a few things that gave me a more articulate language to express the anger that I had been feeling all my life. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=639.0s)]
*  Did you have other female friends who you could sort of talk to about this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=648.0s)]
*  Not about this. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=655.0s)]
*  This is not great. What's going on here? We got to break free. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=656.0s)]
*  I didn't because girls were into, I don't know, trying to catch a husband, I suppose. I don't know. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=660.0s)]
*  I found a community of women who thought alike when I started working as a journalist in a women's magazine called Paula. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=668.0s)]
*  And it was a fascinating time because this was the first time in Chile there was a magazine that dared publish [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=678.0s)]
*  topics that had never been touched before. So we talked about abortion, divorce, infidelity, all those things plus politics. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=689.0s)]
*  So we got involved also in what was going on in the streets among people, you know. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=702.0s)]
*  So it was, but we also had fashion and beauty and decoration. It was a glossy women's magazine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=708.0s)]
*  But with all this information that women had not had before, it caused quite a stir. It changed the culture. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=716.0s)]
*  Now, many years later, 50 years later, we are considered, that magazine is considered an icon in the culture in Chile. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=726.0s)]
*  So that's how important it was. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=735.0s)]
*  That must have been so exciting. I mean, how? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=737.0s)]
*  It was fascinating. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=741.0s)]
*  How was it to find a place that you felt finally? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=742.0s)]
*  To find a place and this young, all these women were young. They were all beautiful. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=746.0s)]
*  They were so daring. It was great. It was just great. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=752.0s)]
*  So early in your career, you were a journalist, you worked for this magazine, Paula, as well as several other places. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=759.0s)]
*  And the story goes that you met one of the most famous Chilean writers of all time, the great Chilean poet. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=766.0s)]
*  Pablo Neruda. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=774.0s)]
*  And he said, Isabel, maybe this isn't for you. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=775.0s)]
*  Well, he was living in the beach in Isla Negra. He was sick and he already had won the Nobel Prize. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=781.0s)]
*  And he invited me to his house and I thought he wanted me to interview him. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=790.0s)]
*  This was such a huge honor. I mean, everybody was so jealous in the magazine because he had chosen me to go and interview. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=794.0s)]
*  It was winter and I drove raining all the way to that place. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=802.0s)]
*  And he received me very kindly. He had lunch for me, a bottle of white wine. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=806.0s)]
*  He showed me his collections. His collections now are considered art. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=814.0s)]
*  Then it was junk. And then I said, OK, Don Paulo, I really need to do the interview because it's going to get dark soon and I need to get back. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=819.0s)]
*  What interview? He said. Well, I came to interview you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=829.0s)]
*  Oh, no, my dear, I would never be interviewed by you. You are the worst journalist in this country. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=834.0s)]
*  You put yourself always in the middle of everything. You lie all the time. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=839.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that if you don't have a story, you make it up. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=843.0s)]
*  Why don't you switch to literature where all these defects are virtues? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=846.0s)]
*  I should have paid attention, but I didn't. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=851.0s)]
*  And many, many years later. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=855.0s)]
*  Let's just take a step back. You're in the home of this literary genius. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=858.0s)]
*  And he tells you something that to most people would be crushing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=866.0s)]
*  I was crushed, too, of course. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=870.0s)]
*  Of course I was crushed. But he said it very kindly. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=873.0s)]
*  And I asked him then why he had invited me if he didn't want me to interview. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=876.0s)]
*  He said because he liked what I wrote. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=881.0s)]
*  And sometimes he would make copies of my humorous articles and send them to his friends. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=884.0s)]
*  And that's why he wanted to meet me. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=889.0s)]
*  But you did not listen to him at the time. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=892.0s)]
*  No, and no, I didn't. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=894.0s)]
*  And then. Two months later, we had the military coup. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=897.0s)]
*  So forget about any plans for the future. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=902.0s)]
*  Everything was disrupted forever. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=905.0s)]
*  And it was one of those crossroads in your life in which you have to take a new direction that was completely not planned and not expected. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=908.0s)]
*  And my career as a journalist ended there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=918.0s)]
*  You had to go to Venezuela because there was a military coup. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=922.0s)]
*  What was the moment you knew it's it's time for me to go? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=927.0s)]
*  It took months and months because although in Chile, the brutality started in 24 hours. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=933.0s)]
*  The Congress was dismissed indefinitely. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=941.0s)]
*  There was censorship for everything. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=944.0s)]
*  The all civil rights were suspended. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=946.0s)]
*  There was no obvious corpus, which means that a person can be arrested and they don't have to give you any explanation. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=952.0s)]
*  And there is no hearing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=960.0s)]
*  There is no court. You just go to jail or disappear. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=962.0s)]
*  You can be tortured and nothing happens. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=966.0s)]
*  No one is accountable. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=968.0s)]
*  But although things happen very quickly in Chile, we got to know the consequences slowly because they don't affect you personally. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=970.0s)]
*  Immediately. Of course, there were people who were persecuted and those were affected immediately. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=980.0s)]
*  But most of the population wasn't. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=987.0s)]
*  So you think, well, I can live with this. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=989.0s)]
*  Well, it can't be that bad. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=992.0s)]
*  No, it's impossible. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=994.0s)]
*  So you are in denial for a long time because you don't want things to change so much. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=995.0s)]
*  And then one day it hits you personally. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1001.0s)]
*  And then it's the time when you say, OK, I'm done. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1006.0s)]
*  For me, it was several things. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1010.0s)]
*  I was at the beginning, I was hiding people in my house because we didn't know the consequences. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1012.0s)]
*  We had no idea that if that person was arrested and forced to say where they had been, I would be arrested. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1020.0s)]
*  Maybe my children would be tortured in front of me. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1028.0s)]
*  But you learn that later. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1032.0s)]
*  And then by the time I was directly threatened, then I said, OK, I'm leaving. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1034.0s)]
*  And my idea was that I was going to leave for a couple of months and then come back. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1041.0s)]
*  So I went I went alone to Venezuela. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1046.0s)]
*  And then a month later, my husband realized that I shouldn't go back. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1050.0s)]
*  And so he left. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1057.0s)]
*  He just closed the door, locked the entrance door of the house with everything it contained and left to reunite with me in Venezuela. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1058.0s)]
*  We never saw that house again. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1070.0s)]
*  And everything it contained was lost, which doesn't matter at all because I don't remember what was in there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1072.0s)]
*  But I do remember the moment when I crossed the Andes in the plane and I cried in the plane because I knew somehow instinctively that that this was a threshold, that that everything had changed, definitely changed. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1078.0s)]
*  How did you explain it to your children? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1101.0s)]
*  I didn't. And that's my crime. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1105.0s)]
*  We did. We tried to protect the children from fear. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1108.0s)]
*  We were living in fear. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1113.0s)]
*  And fear is a very pervasive thing that changes a society and changes the way people behave with each other and changes you inside. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1115.0s)]
*  Something breaks inside you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1127.0s)]
*  And I did with we didn't want our children to know about torture, about people disappearing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1131.0s)]
*  But they were aware it was suddenly the teacher, two guys would come into the classroom and take the teacher away. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1138.0s)]
*  So the children would see it, but there was no explanation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1148.0s)]
*  And so when we left, the idea was, oh, we are going to Venezuela. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1152.0s)]
*  That's what my husband said. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1156.0s)]
*  We are going to Venezuela to see mommy. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1158.0s)]
*  So it took a while for them to understand that we were staying, that we were refugees, and that probably we would not go back. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1161.0s)]
*  And they had to adapt. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1172.0s)]
*  They had to get along with everybody else and just forget about what was behind. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1174.0s)]
*  So you wrote your first novel at the House of the Spirits at the age of thirty nine. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1180.0s)]
*  And I and I think a lot of people have a feeling that at a certain point, maybe it's too late for doing the thing that they want to do. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1186.0s)]
*  They were meant to do. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1198.0s)]
*  They've always dreamed of doing. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1199.0s)]
*  When you got to that point where you started to write a letter to your grandfather that then turned into this incredible novel, did you think, what am I doing here? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1202.0s)]
*  Like this is not I'm thirty nine years old. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1214.0s)]
*  I'm not going to become a novelist at this age. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1217.0s)]
*  I didn't think about age. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1220.0s)]
*  I was I was feeling that my my life was going nowhere, that I had lived for thirty nine years, almost 40 years, and I had nothing to show for it except my two children. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1223.0s)]
*  And I was very bored administering a school in a country that was not my own country, feeling very alien in many ways, like a visitor and a visitor in life in a way. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1237.0s)]
*  And so this letter that eventually turned into the book was like opening a vein and bleed out all all that that that I was holding. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1252.0s)]
*  And it was I think it was an exercise in longing. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1265.0s)]
*  I wanted to go back. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1269.0s)]
*  I wanted to recover the country I had lost my friends, my job, the life I had before. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1272.0s)]
*  And in that attempt of of recovering things that I had lost, I started bringing in the anecdotes of my grandfather, my country, the family. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1279.0s)]
*  And and they started this. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1295.0s)]
*  These people were it was a whole village that came to the kitchen counter where I was writing and populated the pages. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1297.0s)]
*  I wasn't thinking I didn't have a plan. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1308.0s)]
*  I didn't have an outline of any kind. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1310.0s)]
*  I didn't know how to edit anything to the point that when the book was finished and my husband, who was a civil engineer, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1316.0s)]
*  read it, he said the only thing that he noticed was that the dates didn't match. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1324.0s)]
*  And then you had a character in page 20 that was 18 years old and in page 300 was still 18 years old. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1331.0s)]
*  What happened? This person didn't age. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1338.0s)]
*  So he created a sort of map on the wall with the dates and the characters and what was happening. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1341.0s)]
*  And then I could organize it a little bit. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1348.0s)]
*  But I knew nothing about what I was. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1350.0s)]
*  I didn't have an idea. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1352.0s)]
*  You say you had a feeling that your life was going nowhere. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1355.0s)]
*  You had nothing to show for it other than than your two children. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1360.0s)]
*  I think if I felt that way, I would I would be overwhelmed. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1363.0s)]
*  And I don't know that I would be able to start anything. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1367.0s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could talk about that feeling a little bit more. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1370.0s)]
*  I was lost. I was bored. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1374.0s)]
*  I think I was somehow depressed. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1376.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't want that kind of life. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1380.0s)]
*  But one thing has been always in my life, writing, writing as a journalist, writing letters to my mother, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1386.0s)]
*  writing, writing to my grandfather, always writing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1395.0s)]
*  I think that my way of getting over things, of understanding, of exploring my own soul, my past, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1399.0s)]
*  and also most important of remembering is writing. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1408.0s)]
*  When my daughter died, I was that was the worst time in my whole life. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1413.0s)]
*  And it was a very long time. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1422.0s)]
*  Also lasted more than a year. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1424.0s)]
*  The only way that I could understand it and cope with it was writing. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1426.0s)]
*  And I wrote a book. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1431.0s)]
*  It's been a little more than 30 years since you published that memoir that you just referred to, Paula, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1432.0s)]
*  which is named after your daughter. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's about your life with her and the situation you found yourself in, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1442.0s)]
*  where she was in a coma for quite a long time and then she eventually passed. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1447.0s)]
*  I'm curious how your grief has changed after or evolved in the 30 years since you lost your daughter. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1453.0s)]
*  I feel my daughter like a companion. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1463.0s)]
*  I have her photograph on her wedding day and my mother in a wedding dress when she put it on when she was 80. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1466.0s)]
*  I have these two photographs on the sink where I brush my teeth every morning and every night. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1475.0s)]
*  So I said, good morning, good evening. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1480.0s)]
*  They are always with me. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1483.0s)]
*  And I am constantly in touch with Paula. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1485.0s)]
*  I don't believe in ghosts. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1490.0s)]
*  I don't see her as an apparition. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1491.0s)]
*  And I don't believe that after I die, I will go through a tunnel of light and I will find her at the other end. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1494.0s)]
*  But she lives in me. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1502.0s)]
*  And there's a continuation. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1505.0s)]
*  The grandmother, the mother, the daughter, the granddaughter. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1509.0s)]
*  We're all linked in a chain. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1513.0s)]
*  And we all live in each other in a way. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1517.0s)]
*  I get the impression, I think you've said this maybe before, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1521.0s)]
*  that it's a book that still resonates greatly with people after all this time. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1524.0s)]
*  I have written 30 books. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1530.0s)]
*  And this is the one that has had in time the greatest response from the readers. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1533.0s)]
*  Everybody has losses. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1539.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a child. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1541.0s)]
*  It can be divorce. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1543.0s)]
*  You lose your job. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1545.0s)]
*  You lose your health, your parents. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1546.0s)]
*  And people connect to the loss. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1550.0s)]
*  No matter what loss it is. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1557.0s)]
*  In this case, it's Paula. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1558.0s)]
*  I get the most extraordinary letters. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1560.0s)]
*  So that's the kind of reward that very few writers get. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1563.0s)]
*  I've been very, very lucky. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1567.0s)]
*  Speaking of letters, your first novel, of course, started as a letter. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1569.0s)]
*  Your memoir was a letter to your daughter. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1572.0s)]
*  And I'm wondering if you talk about the exercise of writing letters for you. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1575.0s)]
*  It's just not something that people do anymore. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1579.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's a lost art. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1583.0s)]
*  Language has shrunk to nothing because of the email. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1587.0s)]
*  And we write like a telegram. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1592.0s)]
*  We communicate with very few words and very poor imagery. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1595.0s)]
*  But I grew up writing to my mother every single day [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1603.0s)]
*  because my mother was married to a diplomat. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1607.0s)]
*  And when I was 16, we separated and we never lived together again. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1609.0s)]
*  So we got the habit of writing to each other every single day. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1615.0s)]
*  I would go through the day noticing what I would write to my mother in the evening. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1619.0s)]
*  So I was present in the day taking mental notes of what I was living. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1626.0s)]
*  I was seeing, I was thinking, I was dreaming of the conversations, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1632.0s)]
*  the encounters of everything so that I would have some material [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1637.0s)]
*  for the evening letter to my mother. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1641.0s)]
*  Now, she died in 2018. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1644.0s)]
*  I tried for a while to keep on writing to her as if she was alive, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1646.0s)]
*  but it didn't work. It was very artificial. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1650.0s)]
*  But since then, I go through life like in a state of daydreaming. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1653.0s)]
*  I don't notice anything anymore because I don't have to write about it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1660.0s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1664.0s)]
*  I have collected my mother's letters and my letters since 1987. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1666.0s)]
*  And they are separated in boxes by year. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1671.0s)]
*  Some of the boxes have 600, 800 letters. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1675.0s)]
*  So in total, we have calculated that I have around 24,000 letters. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1679.0s)]
*  Can you imagine the volume of that? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1686.0s)]
*  That's so many words to have exchanged with another person. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1690.0s)]
*  But what did you learn about her from these letters? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1696.0s)]
*  You know, it's very interesting because we were very intimate [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1700.0s)]
*  and open, absolutely open in the letters. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1704.0s)]
*  And when I went to visit in a week, we would feel like uncomfortable [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1708.0s)]
*  with each other because in person we didn't have the same openness [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1713.0s)]
*  that we had in writing. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1718.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1721.0s)]
*  Things got in the way when we were together. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1723.0s)]
*  That didn't when we were writing. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1726.0s)]
*  So I got to know my mother in ways that I don't know anybody else, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1729.0s)]
*  not even my children. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1735.0s)]
*  Everything about her, her health, her dreams, her longings, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1738.0s)]
*  her disappointments, her fights with my stepfather, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1744.0s)]
*  the reconciliations, everything. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1748.0s)]
*  We talked about money, sex, religion, you name it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1751.0s)]
*  She had a sort of Chilean sarcasm that I loved. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1755.0s)]
*  And we connected through that too. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1760.0s)]
*  But that works in a letter. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1763.0s)]
*  And then in person can be offensive. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1765.0s)]
*  Do you feel like there's just something inherent in, as you say, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1769.0s)]
*  the intimacy of letter writing, the access you have to someone's inner feelings [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1776.0s)]
*  that just cannot be replicated when you're with that person for the most part? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1781.0s)]
*  Well, maybe some people can. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1787.0s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1790.0s)]
*  I married Roger. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1792.0s)]
*  We've been together for six years. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1794.0s)]
*  This is your third husband. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1797.0s)]
*  My third husband. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1799.0s)]
*  Not the last one, but the third. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1801.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1803.0s)]
*  And so when we are separated physically, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1805.0s)]
*  he writes to me the most tender and beautiful text, and I can do that too. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1808.0s)]
*  But when we are in person, I just can't say it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1813.0s)]
*  It feels awkward. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1816.0s)]
*  It feels awkward. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1818.0s)]
*  In Spanish you say, for example, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1819.0s)]
*  Tú eres la luz de mis ojos. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1821.0s)]
*  You are the light of my eyes. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1823.0s)]
*  In English it sounds awful. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1825.0s)]
*  I can't say that in person to anybody, but I can write it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1827.0s)]
*  Is it true that Roger reached out to after hearing you on the radio by writing you a letter? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1832.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1842.0s)]
*  Well, an email. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1843.0s)]
*  An email. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1845.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1846.0s)]
*  I was seeing him sitting down, taking out a piece of paper, writing a letter. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1851.0s)]
*  An email. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1852.0s)]
*  He sent me an email, sent an email to my foundation saying that whatever, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1853.0s)]
*  and very brief, and at the end it said that he was willing to go anywhere, anytime to meet me. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1858.0s)]
*  But I answered politely because I receive many emails daily, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1865.0s)]
*  and I don't keep a correspondence with everybody. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1869.0s)]
*  I just answer the first one. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1872.0s)]
*  But he kept writing every morning and every evening for six months. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1873.0s)]
*  I mean, really stubborn, the guy. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1878.0s)]
*  And he didn't sound like the normal stalker. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1881.0s)]
*  He sounded like a very transparent guy, actually. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1884.0s)]
*  So when I went to New York, I went to a conference for reproductive rights. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1888.0s)]
*  I met him. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1896.0s)]
*  And in two days he proposed and said that he would marry me eventually no matter what. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1897.0s)]
*  But he was living in New York and I was living here. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1904.0s)]
*  So he at some point sold his house, gave away everything he had, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1907.0s)]
*  and moved to California with two bikes, his clothes, and some crystal glasses for some reason. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1912.0s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1919.0s)]
*  That's quite powerful. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1921.0s)]
*  You convinced a man to just get rid of his entire life and move across the country. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1922.0s)]
*  He did. I didn't ask him to do it. He did it. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1926.0s)]
*  No, you didn't need to, clearly. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1928.0s)]
*  But you know what is interesting, Gilberto, is that shortly before that, a couple of years before, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1931.0s)]
*  I divorced from my second husband, Willie Gordon, and I sold my house and gave away everything also [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1939.0s)]
*  because I moved to a very small house with my dog and I didn't need anything. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1947.0s)]
*  So we both, in a way, started from scratch together, which was a very good thing to do. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1952.0s)]
*  No baggage. At least material baggage. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1958.0s)]
*  Yeah, no material baggage. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1961.0s)]
*  I read an interview with you where you said that when you got a divorce in your early 70s, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1964.0s)]
*  some people around you thought maybe this is a little crazy. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1971.0s)]
*  How did that feel to you at that stage in your life? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1975.0s)]
*  Well, I was 74 years old. We had been together for 28 years. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1979.0s)]
*  I had loved that man a lot. But you never know why love ends at some point. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1984.0s)]
*  And it isn't sudden. It was a slow deterioration that took years [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1992.0s)]
*  and a lot of therapy to try to fix it until we realized we couldn't fix it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=1997.0s)]
*  And so we divorced and many people say, well, you've invested all these years. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2002.0s)]
*  What's wrong? What is so bad that you can't... [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2007.0s)]
*  Be together. Nothing was really very bad. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2014.0s)]
*  But I thought that it takes more courage to stay in a bad relationship than to start anew alone. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2018.0s)]
*  You really have to be very courageous to decide that you are going to spend the rest of your... [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2026.0s)]
*  of the few years you have with a man that doesn't love you and in a relationship that is not working. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2031.0s)]
*  It's much better to just be alone. So that's what I did. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2038.0s)]
*  You grew up in Chile, lived your young adult life there, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2043.0s)]
*  and then you've been in America for several decades. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2049.0s)]
*  You said during a speech you gave in 2018 when you accepted an award from the National Book Foundation, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2054.0s)]
*  but I was in the audience that night, you said, although I am critical of many things about this country, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2060.0s)]
*  I am proud to be an American citizen. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2066.0s)]
*  I'm wondering how your thoughts about your citizenship have changed if they have at all. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2070.0s)]
*  They have not changed. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2076.0s)]
*  Over the past year, I am really critical. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2079.0s)]
*  I am disgusted at a lot of stuff that is happening today, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2083.0s)]
*  and I'm willing to stand and work to make this country what it should be. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2086.0s)]
*  I want this country to be compassionate and open and generous and happy as it has always been, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2092.0s)]
*  a beacon for the rest of the world. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2100.0s)]
*  Since 2016, I believe, your foundation has worked with refugees, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2104.0s)]
*  especially those along the southern border of the United States. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2109.0s)]
*  Has the work that your foundation does, has it become more difficult in recent months? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2115.0s)]
*  Yes, very difficult. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2122.0s)]
*  And there is a lot of really cruel things happening at the border that most of the American public doesn't know about, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2124.0s)]
*  doesn't know the extent or the brutality. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2133.0s)]
*  And my foundation works with that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2136.0s)]
*  We work with women mostly and children, the most vulnerable people. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2138.0s)]
*  And it's very sad. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2143.0s)]
*  And I don't know for how long we will be able to do this. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2145.0s)]
*  What would stop you? What would get in your way? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2149.0s)]
*  Well, of course, if the work is forbidden, if the people whom we help are targeted, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2154.0s)]
*  and their safety in any way is at risk, then that's as much as you can do. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2163.0s)]
*  You have this humanitarian work that you're doing over here, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2171.0s)]
*  and then over here every day for eight, ten, however many hours you're in front of the keyboard and you're writing. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2175.0s)]
*  Are those two things connected in your mind or do they exist in separate worlds? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2182.0s)]
*  They exist separately because I don't do any social preaching, let's say, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2186.0s)]
*  or political activity in my writing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2194.0s)]
*  I write fiction. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2201.0s)]
*  If I write a nonfiction book, then I feel that I am allowed to say whatever I want, to preach, to teach, to whatever. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2203.0s)]
*  But if it's fiction, I just want to tell a story. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2212.0s)]
*  And I don't want the storytelling to be tinted by ideology. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2216.0s)]
*  I try to separate activism from literature. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2222.0s)]
*  And that's a conscious decision? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2227.0s)]
*  Because I imagine given what you care about, what you're passionate about, the types of stories that you tell, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2230.0s)]
*  that even if you're writing historical fiction or fiction set in the past, something will make its way in. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2236.0s)]
*  There will be parallels, even if that's not your intention. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I try to avoid it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2246.0s)]
*  Sometimes things filter between the lines. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2249.0s)]
*  But the best way to ruin a good novel is by trying to deliver a message. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2252.0s)]
*  You've said that you write sometimes as an act of nostalgia, clearly as an act of remembering. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2259.0s)]
*  What, as you look to the future, what do you think you want to remember now? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2265.0s)]
*  Right now I'm trying to be very present in the process of aging. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2272.0s)]
*  Because I think it's a fascinating time. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2278.0s)]
*  And it's sort of taboo in this society where we live. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2282.0s)]
*  People don't want to hear about aging. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2286.0s)]
*  It's like ugly. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2288.0s)]
*  And it can be, of course. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2290.0s)]
*  But it can also be very liberating and a very wonderful journey. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2292.0s)]
*  So I am trying to keep a record of this right now. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2297.0s)]
*  But I'm very interested in what's happening in the world also. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2301.0s)]
*  So I think that political events like what we are living today in the United States [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2304.0s)]
*  cannot be analyzed or explained or understood in the moment. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2310.0s)]
*  You have to look at it with a distance of time. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2315.0s)]
*  That gives you some perspective. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2318.0s)]
*  And I know this because I remember that I could not write about the military coup in Chile when it happened. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2320.0s)]
*  I had all the information, but I couldn't write about it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2329.0s)]
*  I wrote The House of the Spirits many years later. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2332.0s)]
*  So I think that I hope to have enough time to be able to see what we are living today with some perspective. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2336.0s)]
*  Isabel Allende, thank you so much for joining us here at the interview. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2343.0s)]
*  Thank you, Gilberto. Thank you. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXvHxQgFvoA&t=2348.0s)]
