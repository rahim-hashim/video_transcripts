*  for listening. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  I spoke to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York twice last week in what turned out to be quite a week [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=92.16s)]
*  for the Senate minority leader. In our first conversation, we talked about a lot of things, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=98.0s)]
*  the direction of his party, how Democrats are communicating their opposition to President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump, and also on a more personal note, his fears about the rise of anti-Semitism in America. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=107.44s)]
*  Schumer's written a new book on that topic. It's called Anti-Semitism in America, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=114.32s)]
*  a Warning. It's part history, part memoir, and in it he tracks the long record of prejudice [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=119.12s)]
*  against Jews in the world and its recent surge here at home. That was Monday. When we spoke [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=124.96s)]
*  again on Saturday afternoon, it was after an extraordinary few days in Congress where Democrats [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=132.24s)]
*  had to decide whether or not to vote for a Republican federal spending bill or allow a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=138.16s)]
*  government shutdown. House Democrats had voted in near unanimity against the bill. Schumer [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=142.96s)]
*  initially said that he would as well, but in a shocking about face on Friday, he joined Republicans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  and it passed. The aftermath has been brutal and led to open warfare in the party and questions [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=154.56s)]
*  about Schumer's future as its leader. So when I called him back, we had a lot to discuss. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=161.76s)]
*  Here are my two conversations with Senator Chuck Schumer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=167.92s)]
*  Senator Schumer, in your book, you write that you rarely faced anti-Semitism when you were growing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  up in Brooklyn. What was the moment that you felt that things changed in this country that made you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=182.0s)]
*  want to write the book now? So I was born in 1950, and for the first 50 years, it was sort of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=187.6s)]
*  what you might call the golden Medina, the golden age for Jewish people, not only in America, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=194.48s)]
*  but forever, because we had never seen such acceptance. We were accepted in ways we never [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=200.0s)]
*  thought. I was so proud when I was, I guess, about 12 years old that Sandy Koufax, a Jewish [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=208.88s)]
*  pitcher, not a scientist or a teacher, didn't play ball on Yom Kippur, and that made us so proud. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=214.48s)]
*  I experienced a little anti-Semitism. There was a moment, for instance, when I was eight years old [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=223.44s)]
*  and we were driving home from my grandma's house, and someone rolled down the window and said to my [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=228.0s)]
*  nice, decent father, you fucking Jew. I think of that almost every week, but it didn't happen very [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=233.2s)]
*  much. And the Jewish people, all the kinds of discrimination that we had seen, Jews couldn't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=239.2s)]
*  work here, Jews couldn't do that, even the sort of innuendos went away. And there was one reason [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=245.92s)]
*  above all, the Holocaust hung over a curtain, not only for Jewish people, but of course us, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  we always thought about it. I get a little emotional. People on my block, older ladies [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=256.96s)]
*  would come and roll up their sleeves and show us the numbers on their arms that the concentration [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=262.96s)]
*  camp made them do because they were just a number, probably scheduled to die. Okay. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  When did that change? It began changing in the beginning of the 21st century. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  And what I've written in the book is when things get bad or a little rough, that's when anti-Semitism [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  sort of bubbles up and then can get worse. Conor Cruz O'Brien, the great Irish poet, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=288.32s)]
*  said anti-Semitism is a light sleeper. So in 2001, for the first time after 9-11, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=294.96s)]
*  we saw these conspiracy theories. Oh, the Jews did it, all the Jews evacuated the building, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=301.92s)]
*  et cetera. But okay, it was not good, but it didn't lead to a huge spread of anti-Semitism. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=306.56s)]
*  2008 got a little worse because of the financial crisis and the international conspiracy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=313.12s)]
*  And there were all kinds of theories, George Soros. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=319.76s)]
*  30 years earlier, they never would have dared use George Soros as the sort of way to talk about the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  international conspiracy because he was Jewish and because of the Holocaust. But it was October 7th [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=330.4s)]
*  that changed it all. And all of a sudden, anti-Semitism explodes in ways we've never seen, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  and overt anti-Semitism. Jewish bakeries being called Zionist bakeries and rocks thrown through [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=341.36s)]
*  their windows. People who are yarmulkes or Jewish stars being screamed at, yelled at, vilified, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=347.36s)]
*  even punched and cursed. All the kinds of things that we had not seen in America for a very long [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=353.44s)]
*  time. And it shocked us. For the first time, Jews I know, I'm part of this generation, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=359.68s)]
*  started saying, oh God, maybe it could happen here. No one thought it would happen here, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=366.64s)]
*  but for the first time, the thought, maybe it could happen here. And as the highest ranking [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Jewish elected official, not only now, but ever in America, I felt an obligation [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=377.36s)]
*  to do what I could to combat this rise in anti-Semitism. So I felt I had to write the book. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=383.84s)]
*  I had to write the book, and hopefully it'll do some good. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=390.8s)]
*  I'm also not sure that everyone understands the important relationship between Jews and the United [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=394.56s)]
*  States itself. What did you want people to understand about the way American Jews feel about [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=399.52s)]
*  their place here and the way that that's changing? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Very good question. That's your job. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=408.48s)]
*  I appreciate the endorsement. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=412.08s)]
*  I appreciate the endorsement. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=414.88s)]
*  I think the American people think the Jews have had it very good. And we have. I used to say [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=419.28s)]
*  when I was younger, oh, America's been so good to the Jews and the Jews have been so good to America. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=427.84s)]
*  The Jewish values and the American values are a very good mix and potent combination and have [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  yielded a lot of success for the Jewish people. But I think people don't realize how [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=440.48s)]
*  fragile we think that success can be because of our history through the generations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  The Jewish holidays are all about escaping being killed. There's a joke. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=453.6s)]
*  How do you sum up the Jewish holidays in three sentences? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=461.12s)]
*  They tried to kill us. We survived. Let's eat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if I wrote that in my book. I hope I did. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=467.68s)]
*  You did write it in your book, but it's true. It is a very good summation of Jewish holidays. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=470.72s)]
*  We seem to be at a moment in American life where issues of identity have become very charged. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=477.92s)]
*  When you were entering politics, how did you navigate how much to make Jewishness part of your [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=484.88s)]
*  brand in your life? Not that much. Jewishness was always [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  part of me. People know I'm Jewish. You know, when a new candidate comes to me [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=496.16s)]
*  and says, what's your advice? I say, my best advice is be yourself. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  The public may not know the difference between your education platform and your opponents, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=504.88000000000005s)]
*  but they can smell a phony a mile away. And then I say, I'm from Brooklyn. Sometimes it helps me, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=509.44000000000005s)]
*  sometimes it hurts me, but I know one thing. If I tried not to be from Brooklyn, I'd be worse [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=515.28s)]
*  than whatever I am. Well, that's a synonym for Jewish. So I was always Jewish, and I enjoyed [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=520.56s)]
*  telling the stories of my family to my caucus and things like that, but it was never that vital to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  my career. And when I ran in 1998, I would go to upstate. You know, before that I was from Brooklyn [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=532.4799999999999s)]
*  and Queens. I was wondering, how would I be accepted as somebody who was obviously Jewish, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=540.0s)]
*  although I didn't go talk about it a lot. I was. I was. It was very gratifying. You know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=547.28s)]
*  very little anti-Semitism. And when I got to Congress, the same. There was some anti-Semitism. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=553.92s)]
*  One of the senior guys when I got on the Judiciary Committee said, Schumer, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=560.16s)]
*  welcome to the Judiciary Committee. So there was some of that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=569.76s)]
*  Can't say. He's dead. He's from Texas. That's all I'll say. You can figure it out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=570.72s)]
*  Um, but, uh, it was not the thing that I was most known for in any, in any way at all. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=574.88s)]
*  You just mentioned this idea of inauthenticity when you were talking about recruiting. And you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=583.12s)]
*  wrote that in the book. You said voters can smell inauthenticity the way blood hounds track ascent. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=597.2s)]
*  And it did bring to mind the situation Democrats find themselves in at the moment. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=598.72s)]
*  Um, do Democrats have an authenticity problem? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=603.6s)]
*  I don't think we have an authenticity problem. We have a real direction now. I feel good about it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=607.68s)]
*  It's this. First, you got to look at who the Democratic party is and who the Republican party [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=614.64s)]
*  is, who they really are. We are the party of working people. We feel that very, very strongly. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=619.92s)]
*  That's who we have always been. The Republican party is a dramatic contrast to that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=625.92s)]
*  In the last 20 or 30 years, in my judgment, they have been taken over by a cabal of greedy, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=632.4799999999999s)]
*  very wealthy people. And their whole goal is to reduce taxes, cut their own taxes, even though [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  they're extremely rich, and, um, uh, get rid of any government regulation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=645.28s)]
*  But you know, that's not how the American people views the Democratic party right now. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=651.76s)]
*  That's right. And that's where we're on. That's where we're moving. That's where we have to move. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=655.52s)]
*  So the contrast is real. What are we saying? And this is not just Chuck Schumer. I've talked [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  to my whole caucus. I've talked to Hakeem in his caucus. I've talked to Martin, the new head of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=665.84s)]
*  DNC. I've talked to some of the others. It's a sort of a simple, it's a simple little phrase. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=670.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is making the middle class pay for tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=676.8s)]
*  And then you can add things to it. Is making the middle class pay for tax cuts for billionaires [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=683.84s)]
*  by cutting your healthcare, your Medicaid, by adding in tariffs and raising your prices, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  by cutting education so your kids don't get an education. That has a number of, I think, virtues. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=693.6s)]
*  I've heard this from Democrats before, though. This isn't new. I mean, I think that that is [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=702.08s)]
*  something that has always been the rallying cry. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=707.44s)]
*  We lost it. Yes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=711.28s)]
*  The rallying cry of Democrats against Republicans. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=712.1600000000001s)]
*  Correct. But it unifies us. In my caucus, from Bernie to Fetterman, everyone in each [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=715.2800000000001s)]
*  believes in this. Second, the public understands it. 80% of the public doesn't like tax cuts for [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=722.32s)]
*  billionaires to hurt the middle class. 60% of Republicans. It's true. So what happened? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=730.88s)]
*  Because you asked, that's your question. Well, I think we always cared. I'm sorry. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=737.44s)]
*  We always cared about the working people. But in the last few years, while we did a lot for [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=741.6s)]
*  working people, here's what we didn't do. We didn't tell people about it. We thought just by [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  legislating, people would know about it. They don't. I am glad you brought this up. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=753.12s)]
*  What I'm hearing you say is that you need to get back to the original message the Democrats have [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  had. Yes. There is a sense, though, that whatever messaging Democrats are doing right now is either [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=764.4s)]
*  too late or, to use a little bit of internet speak, a little cringe. I mean, I've noticed [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=771.6s)]
*  a discernible increase in the way of party leadership, including you, is attempting to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=777.68s)]
*  use social media since the election. Yeah. With more direct-to-camera videos, more explainers. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  It feels so that it's coming from consultants. I use that word again, authenticity. Is it? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=788.96s)]
*  No. We feel it, but we never – we talked about legislation and passing legislation. Now, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=794.0s)]
*  one of the liabilities we have is a lot of the good things that will come out of this legislation, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  take a few years to happen, to build the road, to build a bridge, etc. But frankly, when we did talk [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=805.28s)]
*  about it, it worked. We had five battleground states that we had to win in the Senate. And every [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=811.52s)]
*  week I met with each of the senators about implementing – we called it implementation. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=818.64s)]
*  If we said that to the public, that would be a bad idea, but it was a concept. And they did. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=825.36s)]
*  So Jackie Rosen was in Las Vegas saying, that infrastructure bill, I am now getting you the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=832.08s)]
*  thing we've dreamed of in Nevada for a long time. Las Vegas has about three-quarters of their [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=839.12s)]
*  population, a high-speed rail from Los Angeles to Las Vegas so people could get on the train, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=844.16s)]
*  spend their money in Las Vegas and go home. Tammy Baldwin delivered this bridge that northern [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=849.36s)]
*  Wisconsin had been dying for for 30 or 40 years. So all these things helped them win. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=854.88s)]
*  We won. We won in four of those five. I don't think the presidential campaign did enough of it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=860.16s)]
*  And I don't think Democratic Party as a whole did enough of it. We just assumed we were on the side [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  of working people so they would just naturally assume it. And it didn't happen. We lost them [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=870.64s)]
*  because they didn't think we cared about them enough. We always did care about them, but we [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=876.64s)]
*  didn't convey it. So now, as you said, we're learning to convey in different ways. I put [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=880.8s)]
*  Cory Booker and Tina Smith in charge of the social media. We had like 60 influencers at the State of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=885.36s)]
*  the Union. And again, learning how to communicate. Not just Chuck Schumer talking about the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  legislation we passed, but I brought people there who were affected by what's happening. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=897.04s)]
*  I brought a veteran and they went on all the social media and, according to the people tell [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=902.48s)]
*  me because I get all these reports, it had millions and millions of views. And the bottom line is, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=907.92s)]
*  I think the party as a whole neglected how the social media has become so much more important, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=913.28s)]
*  but we're learning it quickly and we're doing it much better and we're going to do it better still. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=918.64s)]
*  LW. As you know, you got a rough ride because of your protests that you had. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=923.12s)]
*  CM. I know. Yeah, that's in the past. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  LW. What did you think about that? Whose idea was that? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  CM. It just happened. I got excited. I wanted to tell people I didn't do it right. But it's one [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=935.2s)]
*  day. You can't get, because a bunch of people on the social media attack you. And most of the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=942.24s)]
*  attacks on me, even on that, were from the right wing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  LW. Former Ohio representative Tim Ryan called it depressing, wrote it on X. Is it Saturday night [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=952.16s)]
*  live or real life? CM. Look, there's always going to be people [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=957.36s)]
*  who take a shot at you. That's how it is. You just got to move forward. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=959.12s)]
*  LW. I guess it brings in just this wider concern that I've heard from Democratic voters. There's [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  real grief, anxiety, worry. I don't have to tell you that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=971.04s)]
*  CM. Absolutely. LW. And many feel that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=973.84s)]
*  Democratic leadership are operating with an old playbook. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=977.36s)]
*  CM. I don't think it is. I think, first of all, talking about the difference between the two [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=980.48s)]
*  parties is what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to give the contrast. And we have a [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=985.52s)]
*  unique opportunity now. When Trump ran, he could say anything. He said, I'll lower your costs on [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=990.0s)]
*  day one. And once he's not running and he has to govern, and he is so enthralled by tax cuts for [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=997.44s)]
*  billionaires, it gives us an opening to talk to the people who were listening more to Trump [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1003.76s)]
*  before because we didn't talk to them. The negative that Trump is doing, A, is spreading, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1009.2s)]
*  but gives us an opportunity to regain the ear of the working people and middle class people [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1014.16s)]
*  so that we can connect with them the way we always used to. And it did succeed in the past. It even [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1021.28s)]
*  succeeded, even a long time ago, different media world, of course. But 2005, Nancy and Harry, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1027.36s)]
*  I was at Harry's side. I was this little lieutenant in those days. We said, we're going to wait for [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1034.08s)]
*  the issue to pounce on, and then we're going to do it every day. George W. said, we're cutting [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1039.52s)]
*  Social Security. They don't change, the Republicans. And we pounced, and we had huge success. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1044.7199999999998s)]
*  LW. You describe yourself as an institutionalist. You've been a Democratic leader through a period [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1050.8s)]
*  of American politics, though. Were the rules were understood? Politicians on both sides of the aisle [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1057.28s)]
*  operated under mostly agreed upon norms? And I think it's fair to say that that no longer feels [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1063.44s)]
*  true. Especially with the Trump people, absolutely. So are you the right person to lead the party at [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  this moment as someone who basically championed the rules-based order, which is now fundamentally [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1076.32s)]
*  offensive? Look, we have lots of, let me put it this way first. I don't think there's anybody, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1081.68s)]
*  well, I think I know how to win seats back in the Senate, which I've proven. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1086.0s)]
*  I proved it in 2005 when we gained. I proved it in two, three, four years ago. They said, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1090.8s)]
*  you'll never get back to Senate. I said, we're going to. We won the two seats in Georgia, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1095.68s)]
*  everybody's surprised. So one of the talents that I have, and I miss some and have some, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1100.08s)]
*  is how to get the right candidates, get the right campaigns, and win back. And even this year, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1106.24s)]
*  winning four out of those five seats against big headwinds was trouble. But basically, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1111.2s)]
*  I'm not the only person, nor should I be. This idea we need one person, that's a residue when [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  you have a president. We don't. I'm sort of like an orchestra leader. And there's a great deal of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1120.4s)]
*  talent in the orchestra. And my job is to highlight all those talents and emphasize those talents and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1126.56s)]
*  get Chris Murphy out on television and get Bernie out doing the rallies and get everyone to talk to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1131.68s)]
*  their constituencies. So that's my job. All right. I want to talk a little bit about [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1137.28s)]
*  the Democrat strategy more broadly. Last month, you said in an interview that Trump will screw up. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1143.68s)]
*  Yes. He can't help himself. Do you really think, though, that there's something that will move [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1149.84s)]
*  the needle for either Republican legislators or voters? I ask because that feels like [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1154.24s)]
*  a familiar argument against the president. Surely this will be the final straw for someone. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1159.6s)]
*  There's no final straw. It's all the things he is doing. But let me say this. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1163.84s)]
*  Last time he was president, which is the closest experience we have with him, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1170.32s)]
*  admittedly the world has changed some, particularly on the media side, how it works. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1173.84s)]
*  We kept pushing and pushing and pushing and chipping away. And when he went below 40% [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  in the polls, the Republican legislators started working with us. He was at 51. He's now at 48. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1185.04s)]
*  We're going to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it until he goes below 40. Look, I talk to a lot [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1191.2s)]
*  of these Republican legislators. I've worked with them. Some of them are Trump devotees and advocates [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1196.24s)]
*  and all that. But many of them don't like him, don't respect him and worry about what he's doing [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1202.24s)]
*  to our country. Right now, he's so popular, they can't resist him. I mean, so many of them came to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1206.96s)]
*  me and said, I don't think Hexseth should be defense secretary or RFK should be HHS. But Trump [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1213.6s)]
*  wants him. He won. Let's give him. That's not going to be the same. The Republicans would like [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1222.32s)]
*  to have some freedom from Trump, but they won't until we bring him down in popularity. That [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1229.04s)]
*  happened with Bush in 2005. It happened with Trump in 2017. When it happens, I am hopeful [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1235.4399999999998s)]
*  that our Republican colleagues will resume working with us. And I talked to them. One of the places [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1242.56s)]
*  I told them to go in the gym, you know, when you're on that bike and your shorts panting away next to [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  a Republican, a lot of the inhibitions come off. I'm sure. It's not a sight you want to see. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1251.28s)]
*  Before we move on from this, I do want to ask you about the last election, especially around [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1261.12s)]
*  President Biden's decision to run for a second term. Did you know about President Biden's [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1268.64s)]
*  declining faculties before that disastrous debate? No. Let me tell you a little. I dealt with Biden [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  and his staff often. And whenever I dealt with him, you know, the right wing was saying, oh, he's [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1282.0s)]
*  mentally declined. He wasn't. He had rational, good, strong conversations. Did he ramble from [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  time to time? He's done that when I knew him when he was 45 years old. Did he sometimes forget a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1293.36s)]
*  name? Who doesn't? But he was fine. I didn't realize, I didn't, because of my dealings with [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1298.56s)]
*  him, we're just fine. And we worked on many things and had a lot of success. 2022 was regarded as one [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1304.8s)]
*  of the greatest legislative sessions we had. And we did it together, Senate and him, until the debate. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1310.24s)]
*  And then I realized he couldn't win. Now, I did think the fact that he spoke lower a little bit, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1317.28s)]
*  and he walked slower, allowed the right wing to portray him incorrectly as, you know, not competent. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1325.52s)]
*  But I didn't find that. And if you didn't know, why didn't you know? Was it because they were [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1332.3999999999999s)]
*  keeping him secluded? I can't give you the answer to that. When I dealt with him, he was fine. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1337.76s)]
*  There have been allegations of a cover up. What do you say to those allegations? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1343.2s)]
*  They're just BS. Just BS. There was no cover up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1346.48s)]
*  I want to come back to your book. That's good. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1352.88s)]
*  Senator, Jews in America have always been closely allied to the Democratic Party. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1357.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1362.64s)]
*  But Trump, in this past election, clearly saw an opening to win some of them over. And it does [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1363.28s)]
*  seem like the events of the past year and a half have shifted things for American Jews. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1369.92s)]
*  Do you think the political landscape has changed in a lasting way when you look at sort of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1376.64s)]
*  that alliance? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1381.68s)]
*  There are different polling numbers, you know, the exit polls. But most of them show, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1382.72s)]
*  the ones that are most reliable show that still like, you know, a very high percentage, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1387.44s)]
*  70, something like that, of the Jews voted Democratic this year. Okay. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1391.84s)]
*  Some of the more vocal people are on the right. And the Republican Party has made an attempt [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1396.96s)]
*  to make Israel and even anti-Semitism a political issue, which is horrible for Israel. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1403.52s)]
*  I told that to Netanyahu actually years ago, not to make it a political issue, but he did. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1408.24s)]
*  He embraced Trump and did it. But I do think the progressive values of the Jewish people, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1413.6s)]
*  the fact that we've been oppressed for so long, we've always had a sympathy for the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1419.76s)]
*  underdog, that doesn't go away. Obviously, with the situation in Israel, there are some people [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1423.6s)]
*  who felt, you know, the Democrats weren't strong enough, but Biden was. He's stuck by Israel very [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1430.24s)]
*  strongly and most everyone recognizes that. And it cost him. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1436.64s)]
*  It cost him a little. I'm not sure how much, but okay. I think that basically, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  the rank and file Jewish person who is not that political, you know, no more than anybody else, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1448.8s)]
*  is fundamentally a Democrat and will stay that way. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1454.96s)]
*  There is this big debate, though, about where the line is between anti-Semitism and legitimate [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1460.32s)]
*  criticism of Israel's government. I mean, where is that line for you? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1466.96s)]
*  First, I've criticized the Israeli government. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1471.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1474.08s)]
*  And I've criticized Netanyahu, as you know. So, criticism of Israel and how it conducted the war [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1475.36s)]
*  is not anti-Semitic. But it begins to shade over. And it shades over in a bunch of different ways. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1481.52s)]
*  When you use the word Zionist for Jew, you Zionist pig, you mean you Jewish pig. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1488.48s)]
*  There's an incident on the New York subway and a bunch of people got on, you know, protesters or [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1494.8s)]
*  whatever and said, all the Zionists, get off the, who's the Zionist? Raise your hand. Get out of the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1500.08s)]
*  subway car. When the head of the Brooklyn Museum, who was Jewish, or the chairman of the board she [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1504.9599999999998s)]
*  was, but the Brooklyn Museum had nothing to do with Israel or taking positions on Israel, her house [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1510.8s)]
*  is smeared in red paint. That's anti-Semitism. And a lot of the slogans that people use [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1516.08s)]
*  either are or slide into anti-Semitism. Okay? So, from the river to the sea, which is a Hamas [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1526.08s)]
*  expression. Well, what does Hamas believe? People don't pay enough attention to the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1533.9199999999998s)]
*  evilness of Hamas in this whole discussion. What does Hamas believe? That there should be no Jews [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1540.08s)]
*  living from the Jordan River to the ocean. And their view, in their charter, they cite an old [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1545.28s)]
*  Arab proverb, is that a Jew behind the tree? Chop him down and shoot him. So, when people say from [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1551.52s)]
*  the river to the sea, it edges on anti-Semitism, even though some of them may not know it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1557.92s)]
*  How about by any means necessary? Does that mean kill any Jew by any means necessary? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1564.24s)]
*  Okay? And the one that bothers me the most, which I want to take a minute on, is genocide. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1570.16s)]
*  Okay? Genocide is described as, this is the definition, a country or some group [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1575.68s)]
*  tries to wipe out a whole race of people, a whole nationality of people. So, if Israel was not [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1588.08s)]
*  provoked and just invaded Gaza and shot at random Palestinians, Gazans, that would be genocide. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1594.0s)]
*  That's not what happened. In fact, the opposite happened. And Hamas is much closer to genocidal [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1601.04s)]
*  than Israel, even when you have disagreements. And again, I told Netanyahu, you gotta, I told, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1606.96s)]
*  I said to him what I thought, you gotta reduce the number of casualties and make sure aid gets [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1613.2s)]
*  in and stuff like that. Here is the difficulty. Hamas has a different way of waging warfare, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1617.92s)]
*  of using innocent Gazans as human shields. And they do. They put rockets in hospitals. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1625.76s)]
*  They put their military supplies in schools. What is a country supposed to do when rockets [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  are being fired from a school? Sinwar, the head of Hamas who was killed, you know what he said? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1638.64s)]
*  Dead Palestinians and maimed Palestinians are a necessary sacrifice, his words, according to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1647.76s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal, which got his documents. So, Israel's been in a much more difficult [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1652.8s)]
*  position because of what Hamas did. And it's not that Israel is above criticism. Of course it is, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1657.68s)]
*  not above criticism. But Hamas, well, I just, Hamas is never, wait, can I just finish? I'm sorry, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1664.1599999999999s)]
*  it matters so much to me. I feel so deeply about it. Sorry. No, please. Hamas made it much, and no [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1670.8s)]
*  one blames Hamas. I mean, the news reports every day for a while showed Palestinians being hurt and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1678.96s)]
*  killed. And you know, I see the pictures of a little Palestinian boy without a leg or I saw, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1686.56s)]
*  one sticks in my head, there was a little girl, like 11, 12 crying because her parents were both [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1690.56s)]
*  killed. I ache for that. But on the news reports, they never mentioned that so much of the time, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1694.96s)]
*  Hamas used the Palestinian people as human shields. And so, when these protesters come and accuse [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1701.44s)]
*  Israel of genocide, I said, what about Hamas? They don't even want to talk about Hamas. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1710.3200000000002s)]
*  Wait, one final thing. This is very important. Jewish people were subject, at least in my judgment, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1714.64s)]
*  to the worst genocide ever. I put in the book, on the day they got Kiev, the Nazis asked 33 [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1721.68s)]
*  thousand Jews to line up by a trench, strip naked, and they shot them all dead. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1730.96s)]
*  Every day, Auschwitz killed 20 thousand people. My family was killed from a place called Short Kiv in [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1736.32s)]
*  Western Ukraine. And this was vicious and horrible. And it is vicious of the opponents to call it [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1743.04s)]
*  genocide. Criticize it, for sure. Say Israel went too far, for sure. And you know what it does? It [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1750.32s)]
*  increases anti-Semitism because they're making Israel and the Jewish people look like monsters, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1757.04s)]
*  which they are not. I can see how passionate you feel about this issue. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1762.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, my great-grandmother was the wife of a well-known scholar in Short Kiv. The Nazis rolled [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1767.52s)]
*  in in 1941 and said to the Jewish people of Short Kiv, gathering in the town square, and then my [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1772.72s)]
*  great-grandmother, who had a house on the town square, they said, your greater family should come [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1780.3999999999999s)]
*  to the porch. About 35 people from age 85 to three months came to the porch. The Nazis, in front of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1784.0s)]
*  all the Jews in Short Kiv, said, you're coming with us. She said, we're not moving. They machine [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1790.8s)]
*  gunned every one of them down. I was in China on the night of October 7th, and the Israeli ambassador [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1794.88s)]
*  came in and told me what happened in the kibbutz of Be'erih. And they took like a hundred from the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1801.84s)]
*  elderly to the children on a stage and shot them all dead. So, yes, it's very emotional, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1808.48s)]
*  and to almost all Jewish people, we all have relatives, and we know about this has happened. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1814.96s)]
*  Again, genocide is a vicious, vicious word to use. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1822.0s)]
*  I will say it's a word that a UN special committee has used. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1827.6s)]
*  Please, the UN has been anti-Israel, anti-Semitically against Israel, double standard. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1831.84s)]
*  Moynihan was my idol. He became famous when in 1976, they tried to pass a resolution, Zionism is [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1839.6s)]
*  racism. To say that the Jewish people should not have a state when every other people should have [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  a state is anti-Semitism, the old double standard, ipso facto. And the international organizations, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1853.52s)]
*  I have no faith in them being fair. These same international organizations, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1860.64s)]
*  when horrible things go in in Darfur or China or wherever, they look the other way. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1864.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious how you think about how protests then should be addressed, considering the context of [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1870.64s)]
*  what you just said. The Trump administration just announced they're pulling $400 million in funding [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1878.3200000000002s)]
*  from Columbia University, giving the reason as quote, relentless violence, intimidation, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1883.44s)]
*  and anti-Semitic harassment. I'm wondering what you make of that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1888.32s)]
*  Columbia did not do enough. I criticized them. And believe me, I believe in free speech. I believe [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1891.84s)]
*  in the right to protest. As you read in my book, I started my career protesting the Vietnam War. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1897.28s)]
*  I say to some people, if I were your age, the younger people protesting, I'd be protesting [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1903.76s)]
*  something or other. So I get that. And I love it. And it's about America. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1908.56s)]
*  Protest. But when it's shades over to violence and anti-Semitism, the colleges had to do something. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1912.8s)]
*  And a lot of them didn't do enough. They shrugged their shoulders, looked the other way, et cetera, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1920.8s)]
*  Columbia among them. Okay. So what did they do? They took away $400 million. I'm trying to find out [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1924.24s)]
*  where that $400 million, what they took away. Are they taking away money from cancer research [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1933.1999999999998s)]
*  at Columbia, you know, at New York Presbyterian, which is part of Columbia, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1940.8s)]
*  or Alzheimer's, which are doing good things? What is the $400 million? It could be hurting [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1944.88s)]
*  all students. Students who go there who have nothing to do with the protest, students who [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  might have protested peacefully, or Jewish students who were victims of some of those protests. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1956.08s)]
*  So I think we have to see. My worry is that this $400 million was just done in typical Trump fashion [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1961.68s)]
*  indiscriminately without looking at its effect. And what do you make of what happened over the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1970.56s)]
*  weekend when ICE arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate who is Palestinian, an activist, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1975.36s)]
*  and a green card holder, who was one of the few participants in last year's campus protests to [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1981.12s)]
*  identify himself publicly. And apparently, Trump has made good on his campaign pledge and is set [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1985.84s)]
*  to deport him because of his participation. Look, I don't know all the details yet. They're trying [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1995.28s)]
*  to come out and there'll be a court case which will determine it. If he broke the law, he should [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=1999.52s)]
*  be deported. If he didn't break the law and just peacefully protested, he should not be deported. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2003.92s)]
*  It's plain and simple. What does breaking the law mean to you in this context? You know, it's a [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2007.76s)]
*  legal issue and it's what are Columbia's rules and what does it mean breaking them and what are the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2014.08s)]
*  legal rules about what did he do? I don't know what the charge against him is. So it's a little [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  premature to make a decision except if he didn't break the law, he should not be deported. If he [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2024.48s)]
*  broke the law, he should. That sounds easy, but when we're talking about the right to protest, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2030.0s)]
*  which you were a part of, breaking the law, not breaking the law, those things can be weaponized [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2036.24s)]
*  for political purposes, right? You can arrest political protesters, put them in prison, but [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2042.24s)]
*  they're actually taking part in what is their constitutionally protected right. Well, if they're [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2047.6s)]
*  just protesting and they're arrested, they shouldn't be arrested for protesting as long as [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2052.96s)]
*  they go by the rules. Look, I get protests in front of my house all the time, but they have to [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2057.12s)]
*  have a permit and they have to obey certain rules. There are rules, but the bottom line is we have [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2061.6s)]
*  courts and Khalil will go to court and I have a lot of faith that the judge will give a fair ruling. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2068.16s)]
*  It's not the Trump administration. It's an independent federal judge. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2076.48s)]
*  I want to ask about your own state, which has been seen as a bit of a bellwether these days [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2079.6s)]
*  for some of the political currents in the country. As you know, this past election, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2087.2s)]
*  Trump improved on his 2020 numbers by six points in New York state, including a seven-point shift [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2092.16s)]
*  in New York City. What do you make of that drift? I think that there is a feeling in New York on [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2096.88s)]
*  certain issues that New York is not doing a good enough job. Crime, now crime is actually lower, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2105.44s)]
*  but I talk to lots of people that go on the subway and almost inevitably there's someone there who's [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2112.8s)]
*  not hurting people, but disruptive and frightening them because they read in the paper that some [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2118.88s)]
*  people were hurt, the pushing of people onto the tracks. And so I think that above all, I think [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2123.28s)]
*  that influenced New Yorkers. New Yorkers are willing to put up with a lot to live in New York, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2132.0s)]
*  but they want to be safe. And I think that's the number one reason we lost a percentage vote. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2137.04s)]
*  Throughout your career, you've talked about this fictional couple. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2143.52s)]
*  Yes, the Bailey's. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2146.0s)]
*  The Bailey's, Joe and Eileen. And you think of them as sort of your representative voter constituent. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2146.96s)]
*  You said the Bailey's voted for Trump in 2016. They split Trump-Biden in 2020. I'm wondering who [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2153.6s)]
*  they voted for in 2024. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2159.28s)]
*  They probably voted for Trump. They probably voted for Trump. But if you ask them why, I think they'd [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2160.48s)]
*  say above all crime, Long Island, I think they'd say that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2166.48s)]
*  So what do you got to do to get them back? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2171.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think there are real efforts being made by the city and state to reduce the level of crime. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2174.0s)]
*  It's got to be more. I mean, little things- [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2181.0400000000004s)]
*  But there's some cultural issues, aren't there? I mean, there's also- [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2182.96s)]
*  There are some, but less so in New York, less so in New York. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2184.96s)]
*  When I used to advise candidates who were running for mayor, you know, democratic candidate, I'd say, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2188.56s)]
*  if you can assure New Yorkers they're going to be safe, it'll almost ensure your election, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2194.32s)]
*  because on all the other issues, New Yorkers are Democrats. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2199.28s)]
*  Well, it brings me to Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled mayor of New York City. He was indicted [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2201.92s)]
*  last year on federal charges of bribery and fraud, among other things. February, the Trump [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2208.16s)]
*  administration directed prosecutors to dismiss the charges against him in an apparent quid pro quo, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2212.88s)]
*  leading to these extraordinary series of resignations at the Justice Department and [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2218.88s)]
*  the U.S. Attorney's Office. Do you think Eric Adams should resign? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2224.08s)]
*  I'm not getting into the mayoral race. I know you're going to ask questions about the characters [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2229.6s)]
*  in the mayoral race. I am. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2234.0s)]
*  But I have had a tradition that has served me well. Don't mix in in primaries in New York. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2235.28s)]
*  I haven't. And this will be interpreted as mixing in in the primary. So I'm not going to answer [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2241.28s)]
*  questions about people running. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2245.36s)]
*  Well, but Eric Adams is a sitting mayor. So this isn't about a primary. This is about someone who [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2247.44s)]
*  is going through very serious allegations against him and the Trump administration getting involved [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  in that. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2258.48s)]
*  I get it. I understand it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2258.96s)]
*  But if we weren't close to a primary, I might give you another opinion, but I'm not going to [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  give you an opinion on that. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  All right. Let me ask you this. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2267.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  About Andrew Cuomo. Just in this way, he obviously is another very controversial figure [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2270.64s)]
*  in Democratic politics in your state. And he recently entered the New York City mayoral race. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2278.4s)]
*  So it brings up a philosophical question about his candidacy, which is not really about him, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2284.08s)]
*  but the kind of politician that he is. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2289.04s)]
*  You're not quitting. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2291.2s)]
*  No, because I think there's a wider issue here, which is he's pulling far ahead of the rest of the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2292.16s)]
*  pack at this point. And I wonder what you think his popularity says about what kind of Democrat [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2297.04s)]
*  voters can get behind right now. I mean, do Democrats need to run candidates that are more [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2303.36s)]
*  like Trump? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2309.68s)]
*  Let's see what happens in the election. That's all I'm going to say in the primary. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2312.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2317.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, I think, look, without characterizing any of the candidates, I think that safety is the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2318.4s)]
*  biggest issue. I think the other issues, and I don't think New Yorkers are anti-immigrant. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2326.64s)]
*  I mean, people may disagree with how things were handled initially. I don't think New Yorkers are [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2333.68s)]
*  of the view that let the very wealthy succeed and everybody else will succeed. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2342.56s)]
*  I don't think you need candidates like Trump. In fact, I think Trump will be the candidates [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2346.56s)]
*  who support Trump in the next election, the gubernatorial in 2026. There's none in a [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2351.76s)]
*  Democratic primary, so we can't talk about the city, are going to lose because of Trump's support. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump will be a detriment to candidates who have embraced him. They will have to embrace [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2362.32s)]
*  him because the Republican primary and their plutocracy is so powerful in this party, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2369.92s)]
*  but it will not serve them well. It'll serve them poorly. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I've heard you and I've heard other Democratic leaders talk about the next election [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2378.4s)]
*  as if it's just going to be another election like any other election. But my question is, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2384.3199999999997s)]
*  there has been all of this discussion about Trump arguing in the end of democracy. We have seen [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2391.68s)]
*  all these measures being taken by the Trump administration that are pushing back Democratic [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2399.12s)]
*  norms in this country. So I am wondering if you think it is going to be just business as usual. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2405.44s)]
*  I worry about this. This is a very serious... When I say we'll win the election, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2409.76s)]
*  I'm assuming democracy stays, but we have to fight to make sure that happens. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2413.52s)]
*  Let me just say a few things. I am worried about that. I think that Trump is destroying [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2418.0s)]
*  norms that have preserved our democracy for probably for centuries, certainly for decades, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2423.36s)]
*  and he's destroying them and he doesn't care. What is our best bulwark? It's the courts. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2428.96s)]
*  One of the things which is proving very, very good is we put in 235 new judges and they're now [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2435.76s)]
*  hearing so many of the cases that attorneys general, private citizens, unions, and others [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2442.7200000000003s)]
*  are bringing. We've had a preliminary success in that we filed 100 cases. We have won with TROs, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2449.52s)]
*  usually not a final determination, temporary restraining order, about 87% of them. They have [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2456.88s)]
*  had just this week a judge threw out the cuts to NIH. Are they going to respect those court [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2463.52s)]
*  orders? That is the $64,000. So let us say the courts uphold this. And one of the people who [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2470.8s)]
*  determine that more than any other is probably John Roberts, who is very conservative, far, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2480.4s)]
*  far to the right for my taste. I didn't vote for him. But I do believe in the courts in terms of [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2485.44s)]
*  somewhat of their have to be obeyed and respected. And so I think even at the highest level, if you [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2491.84s)]
*  get the Supreme Court upholding the law, it will matter. What if Trump keeps going? That's the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2498.4s)]
*  question everybody's asking. And I worry about this. I wake up sometimes once at two, three in [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2506.4s)]
*  the morning thinking about this. I believe this, and it's a little bit in concert with what I've [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  said to you before. I believe Republican senators on this issue will stand up. I've talked to some of [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2519.52s)]
*  them. About five or six have said publicly they will work to uphold the courts and to uphold the [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2526.0s)]
*  law if Trump tries to break it. And we can do that legislatively if we have to. That's my hope. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2535.2s)]
*  That's what we've got to work towards. And I think there's a decent chance that that would happen, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2541.36s)]
*  particularly if Trump three months from now is less popular. And then if Trump goes to the highest [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2545.92s)]
*  level and violates all the court orders, I will work really hard to get a Republican. This is the [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2551.44s)]
*  one place above all where a Republican colleagues should and have to stand up to him. I've covered [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2557.12s)]
*  a lot of countries going through democratic backsliding all over the world. And it's a very [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2564.32s)]
*  difficult process to roll back once it is underway. And I've seen how often opposition parties [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2571.04s)]
*  fail to recognize until it's too late that they might have been made irrelevant. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2579.92s)]
*  And I wonder if you think that the Democratic Party might be making that mistake. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2585.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I think we're fighting very hard on every front. And initially we've had some successes, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2589.52s)]
*  but we got to keep at it and we got to be open to new suggestions and ways to do it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2596.64s)]
*  But I think what we're doing is working. So far. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2600.72s)]
*  Following that conversation, it was a tumultuous week in D.C. Schumer voted with Republicans for [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2608.9599999999996s)]
*  a federal spending bill to the surprise and widespread fury of his own party. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2615.52s)]
*  After the break, I call him back to ask about it. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2621.7599999999998s)]
*  Hi, Senator Schumer. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2630.72s)]
*  Lulu, nice to talk to you again. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2649.2799999999997s)]
*  Senator, a lot has happened since we spoke on Monday and you've been at the center of most of it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2652.24s)]
*  In our first conversation, you said you had a plan going forward to fight Republicans, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2657.12s)]
*  but then only a few days later, it looks like your own party is in a civil war. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2661.68s)]
*  Do you think that you made the wrong choice? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2667.44s)]
*  Let me, Lulu, say this. I don't. I think it was a very, very difficult decision between two bad [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2670.72s)]
*  options, a partisan Republican CR and a shutdown that Musk and Trump wanted. For me, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2677.68s)]
*  the shutdown of the government would just be devastating and far worse than the Republican CR. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2685.92s)]
*  Let me explain. A shutdown would shut down all government agencies and it would solely be up [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2691.92s)]
*  to Trump and Doge and Musk what to open again because they could determine what was essential. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2698.4s)]
*  So their goal of shutting down, of decimating the whole federal government, of cutting agency [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2704.24s)]
*  after agency after agency would occur under a shutdown. It would be devastating. Two days [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2710.48s)]
*  from now on a shutdown, they could say, well, snack, food stamps for kids is not essential. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2716.88s)]
*  It's gone. All veterans' offices in rural areas are gone. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2722.4s)]
*  they're not essential. We're cutting them back. So it would be horrible. The damage they can do [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2728.48s)]
*  under a shutdown is much worse than any other damage that they could do. It can last for [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2733.12s)]
*  wait, let me just finish, Lulu. It can last forever. There is no off ramp. One of the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2740.4s)]
*  Republican senators told us we go to a shutdown, which is going to be there for six months, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2746.1600000000003s)]
*  nine months a year. And by then their goal of destroying the federal government would be gone. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2750.88s)]
*  And finally, one final point here, and that is that right now under the present law or under [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2756.64s)]
*  the CR, you can go to court and contest an executive order to shut something down. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2764.0s)]
*  Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power. So in conclusion, I knew this would be an [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2770.7200000000003s)]
*  unpopular decision. I knew that. I know politics, but I felt so strongly as a leader that I couldn't [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2776.1600000000003s)]
*  let this happen because weeks and months from now things would be far worse than they even are today [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2784.1600000000003s)]
*  that I had to do what I had to do. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2789.36s)]
*  Can I just ask you about the tactic here? Because the choice that you made to vote with the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2792.7200000000003s)]
*  Republicans, isn't that an argument to get rid of the filibuster? You wanted to keep it when you [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2800.32s)]
*  were in the majority, but if you're not going to use it in the minority, then what's the point of [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2805.76s)]
*  it? The point here, again, I'll repeat what I said, would be how devastating a shutdown would be. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2809.6000000000004s)]
*  Just think a month from now, if half the federal workers in every agency were laid off. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2815.68s)]
*  But I'm asking about the use of the filibuster. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2819.2s)]
*  No, but the bottom line is if the filibuster would have been used and the government shut down, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2822.08s)]
*  the devastation would be terrible. Terrible. You see, we've had government shutdowns before, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  but never against such nihilists, such anti-government fanatics as Trump, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2836.0s)]
*  Doge Musk. They've given us a playbook. By the way, VOTE already has written what he wants to [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2841.92s)]
*  shut down if he got a shutdown. Trump wanted a shutdown. Musk wanted a shutdown. Ask yourself why. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2847.04s)]
*  When I spoke to you earlier, I asked you if you were the right leader for the second Trump term, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2854.48s)]
*  and you made the case that you were. And you said, and I'm quoting you here, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2859.44s)]
*  I'm sort of like an orchestra leader. But with this vote, it seems you've lost the confidence of [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2863.36s)]
*  many of your players. I mean, it is from Nancy Pelosi to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2868.08s)]
*  who have expressed genuine fury at this. Well, let me just say, look, in my caucus, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2874.64s)]
*  for instance, I knew there would be divisions. There are. But we have respect for one another. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2880.96s)]
*  We each respect that each of us has made the decision because we thought it was right. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2886.64s)]
*  And we are all unified in going after Trump. What I mentioned to you in the earlier broadcast, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2891.92s)]
*  making sure people know. But it's how you go after Trump. Go ahead. Go ahead. The complaints are [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2897.92s)]
*  about precisely your leadership. I mean, there has been reporting that you were not in regular [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2903.6800000000003s)]
*  touch with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries leading up to your decision, that it took many in [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2909.52s)]
*  your caucus by surprise, that there didn't seem to be a plan. That is what more than anything [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2915.28s)]
*  seems to be the case that many in your caucus are making against how this was handled. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2921.44s)]
*  OK, for weeks and months, we had said a shutdown is awful. And by the way, every Democrat, no matter [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2927.2s)]
*  how they voted, wanted to make sure there was no shutdown. We thought there could be a bipartisan [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2933.3599999999997s)]
*  plan. And I talked to Hakeem regularly during this period. We didn't think that Johnson could [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2939.9199999999996s)]
*  get all his votes. He did. When it came to the Senate on Tuesday, our hope was that Patty Murray [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2946.3199999999997s)]
*  could negotiate with the Republican senators and get that 30 day CR, a bipartisan plan. She couldn't. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2952.0s)]
*  So we were faced with two awful choices. The choice has been made. But I think the whole [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2958.8s)]
*  Democratic Party is united on what I mentioned in the earlier broadcast, showing how bad Trump is [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2963.28s)]
*  in every way, organizing. We're organizing this week and next week in Republican districts. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2970.48s)]
*  We're having rallies to not give tax breaks to millionaires. And we're succeeding. We're succeeding, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2977.12s)]
*  Lulu. We're bringing his numbers down. Well, Hakeem Jeffries seemed to throw you under the [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2982.64s)]
*  bus on Friday. He was asked directly if he thought you should be replaced as leader. And he very [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2988.64s)]
*  pointedly refused to answer that question. Have you spoken to Jeffries since the vote? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2992.7999999999997s)]
*  I speak to Jeffries regularly. Have you spoken to him? I have a good relationship. We speak all the [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=2999.68s)]
*  time. But have you spoken since the vote? I want to say this. Have you spoken since the vote? No, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3005.36s)]
*  we haven't spoken since the vote, but we speak all the time. We speak regularly and we have a good [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3009.36s)]
*  close relationship. Senator, you were crucial in getting President Joe Biden to step down. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3015.44s)]
*  Do you think it's time for you to do the same? Let me say this. There is spirited disagreements [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3023.84s)]
*  on which was the right vote. But as I said, I think we have mutual respect in our caucus, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3031.36s)]
*  and we are all united, no matter how people voted on this vote, to continue fighting Trump. We are [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  a united and strong caucus fighting against Trump. We disagreed on this issue, but that doesn't [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3046.8s)]
*  diminish in any way how we're going to fight every step of the way against Trump. And I believe that [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3053.52s)]
*  we're going to have some real successes. There is reporting that some Democrats are now privately [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3059.68s)]
*  urging Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to consider a primary run against you. It now seems likely [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3065.52s)]
*  that she or someone else will primary you in New York in 2028. Do you think the base has your back [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3071.8399999999997s)]
*  after this? Because ultimately they'll decide who becomes New York's next senator. Yeah, that's a [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3077.6s)]
*  long time away. I am focused on bringing Trump's numbers down, his popularity down, exposing what [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3086.0s)]
*  he has done to America and what he will do. That's my focus right now. And that's what I'm focusing on [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3092.4s)]
*  24-7. Three years from now is a long way to speculate. I believe that my hard work against Trump [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3099.44s)]
*  will pay off. Senator Schumer, thank you so much for talking to me on a Saturday. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3107.92s)]
*  Nice to talk to you, Lulu. Bye-bye. That's Senator Chuck Schumer. His book is called [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3113.92s)]

*  Since our first conversation, Senator Schumer has released a statement about Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3131.92s)]
*  writing that if the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security can't show [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn0MvTFktU&t=3137.04s)]
