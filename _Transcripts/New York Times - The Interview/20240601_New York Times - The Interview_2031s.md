# 'The Interview': Richard Linklater Sees the Killer Inside Us All
**New York Times - The Interview:** [June 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview, I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=0.0s)]
*  If I ask you to think of a Richard Linklater movie, what do you think of? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=8.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the cult favorite Days of Confused, that's the movie that launched Matthew McConaughey's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  career. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=17.88s)]
*  Or maybe it's Before Sunrise, the first installment of his beloved trilogy about big ideas, love [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=18.88s)]
*  and fate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=23.84s)]
*  Or maybe you'd think about the low-key, coming-of-age epic Boyhood, which Linklater famously [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=24.84s)]
*  filmed over a dozen years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=29.84s)]
*  And of course you can't forget School of Rock, his biggest hit, which exists in a category [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=31.56s)]
*  all of its own. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=36.6s)]
*  And to me, that's the fun of Linklater's work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=38.6s)]
*  You never quite know what he's going to make next. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=40.96s)]
*  So I wasn't surprised to see him getting into romantic crime thrillers with his new movie [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=44.04s)]
*  Hitman. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=48.32s)]
*  It stars the great Glenn Powell, who also co-wrote it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=49.32s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=52.16s)]
*  But I would argue that it's excellent because it's actually not so far off from his other [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=53.16s)]
*  work as it might seem. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Between all the thrills, the crimes, and the sex, Hitman sneaks in a pretty provocative [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=59.36s)]
*  exploration of one of Linklater's favorite themes, the changing nature of identity. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=63.68s)]
*  Basically, what it means to be a person. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=68.92s)]
*  It's also a movie, as so many of Linklater's films are, that understands just how much [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=72.36s)]
*  fun it is to watch smart characters talk to each other, exploring ideas, making each other [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=76.2s)]
*  laugh, and even testing each other a little bit. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  It's the talking that made me fall in love with Linklater's films, because those are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=84.28s)]
*  the kinds of conversations that are most meaningful to me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to make too much of all this, but I can see a pretty clear line from teenage [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=91.04s)]
*  me sitting around watching Waking Life and Slacker over and over again, to me here now [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=95.76s)]
*  talking with those films director, Richard Linklater, who, as it turns out, sounds a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  lot like a character from one of his movies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=105.48s)]
*  Here's our conversation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=108.28s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that a lot of your films are asking questions about identity [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=116.2s)]
*  and formation of identity, and given that that's a recurring theme in your work, I'm [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  curious how you think about your identity at 63 years old. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you feel like it's fixed? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=135.08s)]
*  Do you feel like you still have formative experiences? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=136.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Isn't that the question of self? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the kind of thing I thought a lot about my entire life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  What could transform me? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  What could make me feel different than how I feel, how I see the world? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=150.84s)]
*  So I've always kind of monitored that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=155.96s)]
*  Like, what's going to change me? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=158.52s)]
*  I was probably more in the camp of we're fixed, give or take whatever, a little percentage [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=160.8s)]
*  around the edges, and we sort of accept ourselves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  So I was more interested in this notion lately that, oh, you really can change. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=170.48s)]
*  You know, the personality isn't fixed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=177.72s)]
*  But that seems sort of current, you know, in a way. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=181.0s)]
*  This notion of self and identity, you know, gender, anything. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=184.2s)]
*  I sort of like that it's all on the table, that everybody's thinking like, well, you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=189.44s)]
*  kind of are who you say you are, you know? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=193.12s)]
*  To me, that's interesting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=195.76s)]
*  Do you have a lot of different identities? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=197.72s)]
*  Yeah, probably as many as anybody else. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=199.8s)]
*  What are the different ones? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=203.92s)]
*  Well, you know, if you get me on a ping pong table, like an area where like my third rail [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=205.96s)]
*  is athletics, you know, I cross into this realm where I was acculturated and just good [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=213.72s)]
*  enough to like figure I should be good and achieve and I have this bar for myself. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=219.96s)]
*  So I feel this little rush of competitiveness, which I really don't have in the world of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=227.5s)]
*  art at all, or my life even. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=233.8s)]
*  I don't see it anywhere. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=236.38s)]
*  But it's in certain areas, and I try to avoid them because it's not the best me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=238.3s)]
*  But every now and then, it can be fun to kind of push yourself. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=243.9s)]
*  But you know, I'm the guy looking at the world through glass, you know, I was always the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=248.1s)]
*  guy in the corner thinking about everything. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=251.76s)]
*  I'm not an extrovert. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=253.86s)]
*  I'm an introvert who gets put in extroverted situations occasionally, and I could play [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  that role. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=261.62s)]
*  But roles I currently play? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=262.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=264.62s)]
*  It's nice to care less about it as you get older. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=266.48s)]
*  About what? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=270.5s)]
*  Like consistency, maybe. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=271.5s)]
*  But my pure self is on the set. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=274.38s)]
*  I'm making a movie. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=276.18s)]
*  I'm pretty convinced. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=277.3s)]
*  The self that I've worked for and the pinnacle of my time and effort, I realize, is rehearsing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=278.74s)]
*  and shooting the movie and whatever writing before. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=287.26s)]
*  That's the pure me, but it's manufactured me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=290.5s)]
*  Catch me at dinner later and you get the same guy who's processing the shit of the day and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=293.38s)]
*  having his lectures about what I know and whatever lunatic political ideas that are [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  flowing through my system in real time like everybody else. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=306.86s)]
*  But I process the world through art and in particular cinema, and that's the space that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=309.86s)]
*  I've been lucky enough to live in. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=316.1s)]
*  What's a lunatic political idea that's in your system right now? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=319.54s)]
*  Oh, you're really going to... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=322.66s)]
*  Well, you notice. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=324.06s)]
*  I don't really... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=326.22s)]
*  If you're unfortunate enough to be sitting next to me at dinner or around me, I often [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=327.62s)]
*  just spout off. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't have a need to share that publicly so much because I know it's not a long-term [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=334.92s)]
*  thought. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=339.48s)]
*  I guess the meticulous long-term nature of making a film is a certain kind of personality. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=340.48s)]
*  Someone who has to be on Twitter or whatever spouting off their moment to moment taking [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=346.6s)]
*  in and spitting out of the world, I have those ideas, but I know they have no value. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  I know I'm not going to enlighten anyone, but I really do draw a line. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I could mouth off, I could share my brain snot with the whole world the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=365.16s)]
*  way everybody else did, but I don't see any value in it for me personally because I've [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=371.52s)]
*  been privileged, gifted, whatever you want to say, to make the greatest, most expressive [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=378.12s)]
*  storytelling art form ever invented. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=384.56s)]
*  I'm one of the few who get to do that, so why would I put any effort into these transitory, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=388.12s)]
*  weird little reactive areas? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=397.0s)]
*  I think you should file away brain snot as a possible fictional band name in a film, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=399.4s)]
*  the name of a punk EP, maybe a seven-inch brain snot. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=406.6s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=410.88s)]
*  Well, that's what so much of the world feels like, doesn't it? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=411.88s)]
*  Brain snot? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like, it's active brains, but just unfiltered, unaccredited, what was kind of fun a long [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=417.44s)]
*  time ago. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=427.4s)]
*  Oh, let's just say conspiracy or alternative thinking and all that, just to see it metastasize [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=428.4s)]
*  into something so lethal and harmful. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=434.4s)]
*  So it's kind of like, wow, I don't want to participate in that at all. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=439.23999999999995s)]
*  I want to ask you a question that connects a little bit more to Glenn Powell and Hitman. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=444.56s)]
*  In the film, Glenn Powell plays a half dozen or so different Hitmen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=451.08s)]
*  His character is assuming these different roles within the film. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=456.72s)]
*  It's really, I hate to use a corny term, but it's kind of like a star-making performance. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  I think he's someone who people have a sense that this guy's a big star in the making. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=466.0s)]
*  You've done movies with a bunch of big stars. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=471.48s)]
*  You did, obviously, Matthew McConaughey's in The Newton Boys and Dazed and Confused [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  in Bernie. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=479.88s)]
*  Keanu Reeves in A Scanner Darkly, Ben Affleck. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=480.88s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  Shirley MacLaine, Jack Black, both in Bernie. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  I always wondered, do you feel like as a director, you understand what makes someone a star? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=488.16s)]
*  Every actor I work with is like, oh, this is a star to me. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=496.1s)]
*  I love him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  I think my camera loves him. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=499.6s)]
*  I love the character. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=501.04s)]
*  So it's always been a mystery to me what happens with people's futures. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=502.92s)]
*  You just don't know. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  I think there's luck. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of elements involved that no one person's in control of. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think anyone's ever surprised me. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=516.96s)]
*  Like I'm not surprised when Matthew becomes a star or Ben Affleck. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=518.72s)]
*  You look back and it all makes sense. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=522.8s)]
*  It's like, yeah, of course, they were great. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=524.2s)]
*  They had this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=525.76s)]
*  I'm probably more surprised others didn't get that opportunity or aren't seen as that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=526.84s)]
*  Hollywood doesn't know what to do with. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=532.04s)]
*  There's kind of an eternal mystery of opportunities and cultural moments that you get. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=535.12s)]
*  So I think Glenn's having one of those right now, perhaps, it seems. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=542.12s)]
*  But I think anyone who knows Glenn, who's worked with him in the last 10 years, would [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=548.16s)]
*  say, oh, that could have come 10 years ago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=551.36s)]
*  Glenn is Glenn. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=553.64s)]
*  He's got that star quality. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=554.64s)]
*  I've known that for a long time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=555.88s)]
*  Do you think actors can see in themselves the qualities that you as the director can [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=558.76s)]
*  see? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=564.88s)]
*  I'm thinking of an example that a few years ago, I interviewed Brad Pitt around the time [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=565.88s)]
*  of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=572.84s)]
*  I was asking him about this one specific scene where he just sort of turns towards the camera [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=574.88s)]
*  a little and he's got this smile. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just a perfect example of how star quality can make a scene. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=582.48s)]
*  And I was asking about it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=588.76s)]
*  It was clear he had no idea. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=589.76s)]
*  He didn't really remember the scene, had no idea what I was talking about. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=590.76s)]
*  And then, of course, after the interview was over, I realized that was actually a question [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=593.72s)]
*  for Quentin Tarantino. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=597.44s)]
*  He understood something in that actor in that moment. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not about whether the actor knows him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=603.54s)]
*  But do you think you see things in these personalities that they aren't aware of? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=605.12s)]
*  It's not the kind of thing you talk about consciously. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  There's nothing to be gained for telling the actor, well, you're such a star in this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=612.52s)]
*  You don't need to, you know, you can just turn and look that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=616.48s)]
*  You know, you just say, hey, look over here and look that way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  You know what you're dealing with. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=623.36s)]
*  You know they're a star. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=625.0799999999999s)]
*  And cinema rides on this kind of star charisma. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=626.68s)]
*  Brad Pitt knows he's a fucking star that's been drilled into his head every day for the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=630.4s)]
*  last 30 years. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=634.6s)]
*  But maybe how it's used and, you know, whatever. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=635.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, I read, I think it was the New Yorker profile of you, probably around the time of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  boyhood. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=646.6s)]
*  And in there, it said that there was some point in your life as a young man where you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=647.6s)]
*  were watching something like 600 movies a year. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=652.2800000000001s)]
*  You would go to a theater and watch three or four movies in a row. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=654.6s)]
*  And I think a lot of us can relate to that feeling, especially in sort of early adulthood [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=658.2s)]
*  or late adolescence of really like falling in love with an art form. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  You almost get kind of drunk on it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm curious what the feeling you get from movies now is and how it's different from [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=671.4s)]
*  what it used to be. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=679.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you can ever replace that initial just passion and fury when you've [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=680.88s)]
*  discovered your art form and you just take it in with your entire being. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=687.88s)]
*  I'd write down every movie I saw, 650 films a year. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that was really nothing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of it, you know, looking back, it's like, oh, that's what you had to do. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=698.12s)]
*  Kind of your transitioning from the real world to your world and your world. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  In my case, it was just cinema. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=707.52s)]
*  The arts are this other world you want to live in, not the world you live in. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  But it's different now. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't have the need to see that many movies. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=717.12s)]
*  I still love movies and still life dedicated to it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=720.2s)]
*  But you know, you feed yourself in different ways. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=725.08s)]
*  Do you still get like the electricity or the jolt from seeing a film that you used to? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=728.08s)]
*  Like, what's a recent movie that kind of blew the top of your head off? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=736.12s)]
*  You know, no, I can't get the same jolt. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=738.12s)]
*  I just you can't. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=741.24s)]
*  You can't get the same jolt. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=742.44s)]
*  I can get a jolt. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=743.96s)]
*  But it's a different kind of jolt. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=745.4000000000001s)]
*  I know too much. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm behind the camera. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=748.6s)]
*  I know what they're doing. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=750.36s)]
*  But I can still, you know, I judge films on like, oh, what got my cinematic blood circulating? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=752.36s)]
*  What really kind of got me like, oh, that was cinema, you know? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=759.96s)]
*  So maybe I kind of put zone of interest in that category. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=763.92s)]
*  I was looking at that going, bold, you know, boom. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=767.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=770.52s)]
*  That's a movie. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=771.4s)]
*  I think there's a sense currently that we're sort of in a weird moment for cinema. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=772.8s)]
*  And I've even read interviews with you where you've wondered about whether the current [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=779.12s)]
*  generation of audiences value cinema and whether you came up during kind of like the last, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=785.0799999999999s)]
*  I think the way you put it was the last, good era of filmmaking. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=790.88s)]
*  What makes you wonder those things? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=794.8s)]
*  Like, why are those questions in your mind? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=796.28s)]
*  Well, I don't think I said good era of filmmaking. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=798.88s)]
*  I would say maybe the culture was different. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's always the last question, you know, you're talking about your new movie. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  It's always, what do you think about the state of cinema today? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's like, oh, be careful. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  Because it's, I don't know, we're all prone to these overarching big important statements [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  about the state of things. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=817.7199999999999s)]
*  And if you know anything about the history of cinema, that's all it's ever been. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  It's always been the end of cinema. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=824.4s)]
*  Something was wiping it out. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=826.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, even sound, color, technicolor, you know, cinemascope, TV, it's always been [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=828.28s)]
*  under threat. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=834.48s)]
*  It's always been very volatile feeling. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=835.48s)]
*  The industry is always threatened. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=837.48s)]
*  I think because it's an industry that's prone to technological change. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=840.0s)]
*  You know, things can come along and just wipe it out or change it pretty significantly. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=844.28s)]
*  So it's different than painting or literature or other art forms. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=849.28s)]
*  Technology and commerce are really nearby, kind of codependent within the art form. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=854.2s)]
*  So I think everyone's always on alert and everyone's always a little paranoid that the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  system that they've known is coming to an end. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=868.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, you're working currently on an adaptation of the Sondheim musical, Merrily We Roll Along, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  which the musical takes place over the course of 20 or so years. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=880.68s)]
*  And your plan, sort of like what you did with Boyhood where you filmed it over a period [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=884.8s)]
*  of years and years, is that you're filming your adaptation of Merrily We Roll Along over [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=889.04s)]
*  20 years or so. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=894.16s)]
*  At least that's the plan. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=895.76s)]
*  And so when you finish this movie, I guess with the caveat, if you finish this movie, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=898.2199999999999s)]
*  you're going to be over 80 years old. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  I'll be about 80. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=907.7199999999999s)]
*  And so it's going to be kind of a life and career capstone, I would think. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=909.0s)]
*  So tell me why that project, given how like the place you know it's going to occupy in [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=915.44s)]
*  your life and your career. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=922.64s)]
*  You want to hear something that's technically insane, and I admit it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=926.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=929.96s)]
*  You said capstone to a career at age 80. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=930.96s)]
*  I've never thought that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=932.92s)]
*  Because I see myself making a film when I'm like 94. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=934.72s)]
*  I really do. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=938.36s)]
*  So I think it's like, oh yeah, those years will go along. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=940.04s)]
*  I'll try to stay in shape, try to be healthy, hope to get lucky. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=943.88s)]
*  And I just, I mean, I'm not an idiot, I know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=948.52s)]
*  But it's all at the behest of we're telling a story that takes place over 20 years. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's really important for this story to work that you feel those years go by. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's the same reason that you know, boyhood put its, you know, that was boyhood. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=967.52s)]
*  You had to feel life going by. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  And this movie is about long-term friendship and the way life treats people and how that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  shifts around over 20 years. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=982.76s)]
*  But you know, I just think you can, in the arts, you can will things into existence. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=984.96s)]
*  And if people are passionate about it, you make it happen. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=989.68s)]
*  You know, everybody involved in that is clearly doing it because they care. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=993.0s)]
*  So we just have to assume they'll keep caring and they'll care 10 years, 15, 17 more years. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=996.48s)]
*  But you know, you judge people on that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1003.28s)]
*  You go, oh, before I cast them, I'm going to go, you're a lifer, you know, you're going [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1005.12s)]
*  to be doing this. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1008.88s)]
*  I did that on boyhood. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1009.88s)]
*  I asked Patricia Arquette, like, what are you going to be doing 12 years from now? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1011.36s)]
*  And she's like, I'm going to be probably looking for a part to play. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1014.72s)]
*  I said, yeah, and I'm going to be trying to make a film. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1019.08s)]
*  So let's just start now and we'll be who we are now and in the future. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1020.78s)]
*  And that's all it was. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1026.56s)]
*  It's not some huge leap of faith. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1027.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1029.58s)]
*  It's blowing my mind that you could say this movie that I'm going to spend 20 years making [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1030.58s)]
*  that I'm going to finish when I'm 83. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1035.18s)]
*  I'll be 80. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1037.62s)]
*  Hey, don't add any more. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1038.62s)]
*  I mean, they're going to be. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1040.42s)]
*  But that's solely because that's sort of what you think the film itself is demanding and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1042.78s)]
*  not because it's like a meaningful overarching statement of some sort. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1047.5s)]
*  If anybody spent 20 years working on something, you'd say, well, that says something about [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1053.94s)]
*  who they are and what's important to them. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1056.94s)]
*  Telling a well-told story the right way is what means the most to me. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1059.5s)]
*  Finding the form that meets the content, that's what a director does. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  You feel not just the story, but how to tell it, what it should look and feel like. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1067.8s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1071.6200000000001s)]
*  I like long. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1073.22s)]
*  So many art forms are fairly quick. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1074.22s)]
*  I think cinema has the ability to be. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1077.02s)]
*  I love that it's at the Whitney, that J. DeFeo painting the rose. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1081.34s)]
*  Have you ever seen it? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1086.1799999999998s)]
*  It's huge, right? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1087.86s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1088.86s)]
*  It's thick. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1089.86s)]
*  It's like a foot thick because she spent so many years painting layers of paint on it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1090.86s)]
*  I just love it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1097.02s)]
*  I find it so moving just knowing the effort. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1098.02s)]
*  First it's a stunning work, but how did it get so thick and just whatever. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1101.26s)]
*  I mean, most artists, we have found the right therapy for our conditions or whatever neurological [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1104.54s)]
*  conditions we're dealing with. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1114.46s)]
*  But everyone's just wired a little different. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1117.7s)]
*  So I admit that about myself and just go with it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, well, it's the way my brain works. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1125.58s)]
*  Do you have some sort of contingency plan? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1128.3s)]
*  If your vision starts to go 10 years from now, what happens to the film? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1131.26s)]
*  Good thought. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1135.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1136.98s)]
*  Well, if I had everything else in the vision went, I would probably get, I don't know. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1137.98s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1143.3799999999999s)]
*  I can make you a list. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1145.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1146.54s)]
*  I would adapt somehow. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1147.54s)]
*  I'll just turn the whole thing over to someone else. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1148.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1150.74s)]
*  I'll deal with that when it happens. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1151.74s)]
*  It's funny to think that way. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1154.58s)]
*  But I mean, what's the alternative? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1156.78s)]
*  Most people live their life like there's no tomorrow. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1159.66s)]
*  But I'm kind of the opposite. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1162.5800000000002s)]
*  I think of death regularly and I kind of see life as very fleeting and we're all grateful [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1164.5400000000002s)]
*  to be here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1171.38s)]
*  But then I have this other side that just expect to play it out, I guess. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  You think of death regularly? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1178.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1180.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1181.22s)]
*  Not in a bad way. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1184.22s)]
*  I just see life as kind of fleeting. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1187.5s)]
*  Is that bad? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1189.1s)]
*  It sounds like a question that could be posed by a character in one of your films. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1191.46s)]
*  Well, it comes from somewhere. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1195.74s)]
*  It's kind of poetic to know I'm not going to be here forever and no one is. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1198.46s)]
*  I walked through graveyards and I read a bit, but I'm not morbid about it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1202.42s)]
*  I just kind of acknowledge life passing and all of us being here for a little while. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1208.02s)]
*  It's kind of beautiful that we're all here crossing paths at the same moment. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1214.46s)]
*  I saw that as a kid. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1219.66s)]
*  Saw what as a kid? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1221.18s)]
*  Just, I knew it from the earliest of ages. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1222.18s)]
*  I liked astronomy and I liked science and just knowing how old everything was and how [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1224.54s)]
*  brief human life spans and like, oh, we really are insignificant. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1230.82s)]
*  So that scares some people, but I love that feeling. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1236.82s)]
*  I love that feeling of just how random and small we are in the universe. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1239.86s)]
*  I may be going to put this question in slightly pretentious terms, but I think given that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1247.74s)]
*  I'm talking to Richard Link later and certainly there are conversations in your films that [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1252.74s)]
*  some other people might say are slightly pretentious, I'm going to give myself permission to do [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1257.34s)]
*  it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1260.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fine with that. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1261.5s)]
*  But I was just reading about this poet, Delmore Schwartz, and he has this poem called Suraz, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1262.5s)]
*  like the painter George Suraz, Suraz Sunday Afternoon. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1269.38s)]
*  It's all about the artist as someone who observes life, but doesn't fully participate in it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1272.42s)]
*  So I read that and I was then thinking about you and your films because I think of your [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1279.14s)]
*  films as really having all these sort of very closely and intimately observed moments of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1284.2800000000002s)]
*  what on the surface just seemed like normal life. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1291.8200000000002s)]
*  It could be two people walking and talking, or just throughout boyhood. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1294.14s)]
*  There's countless scenes of just normal life. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1299.02s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  And then I thought, well, what does your interest in that have to do with or how does it affect [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1302.6200000000001s)]
*  your sense of observation of your real life when it's happening? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1308.78s)]
*  Like, are you always sort of sitting back and observing life kind of from a distance? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1312.54s)]
*  Always. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1319.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's the curse. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1320.74s)]
*  I'm in the moment. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1322.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm out of the moment. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1323.1000000000001s)]
*  It kind of robs you of the in the moment experience. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1324.68s)]
*  But then there's also kind of a mentality, I think, not uncommon to writers and film [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1328.4199999999998s)]
*  people is like, this will only be real when I process it through my art form. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1334.94s)]
*  Something terrible is happening right in front of you. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1342.1799999999998s)]
*  Your loved one's dying or relationship's ending and you're like, oh, you're just processing [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1344.82s)]
*  it not in the moment, but like, I'm going to have a character in a movie someday experience [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1350.34s)]
*  this and I'm going to try to capture this, what I just felt very, very deeply. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1356.86s)]
*  But you're robbing yourself and the person you're with or whatever of that moment. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1363.62s)]
*  But maybe it's a self preservation way of just taking something and storing it away [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1368.58s)]
*  or processing it through. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1375.9399999999998s)]
*  So I share that, you know, like, nothing's really real until I make it work in a movie [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1377.4199999999998s)]
*  in some way. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1386.18s)]
*  Maybe we'll get into it when we talk again. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1387.18s)]
*  But I really have questions about the last 15 minutes of Hitman. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1389.66s)]
*  But for this time, thank you very much for taking all the time and I'll talk to you in [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1394.66s)]
*  a few days. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1398.94s)]
*  OK, yeah, we'll continue. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1399.94s)]
*  After the break, more reflections from Richard Linklater on art, life and why mellowing out [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1404.0600000000002s)]
*  isn't something to be afraid of. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1409.24s)]
*  I've had this conversation over the years with filmmaker friends. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1411.02s)]
*  Am I as passionate as I was in my 20s? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1414.78s)]
*  Would I risk my whole life if it was my best friend or my negative drowning? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1417.74s)]
*  Which do I save? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1422.34s)]
*  The 20 something self goes, I'm saving my film. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1424.5s)]
*  Hello? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1442.42s)]
*  Richard, how are you? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1443.42s)]
*  Oh, hey. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, there was something that I realized was totally on the tip of my tongue the whole [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1448.0600000000002s)]
*  time we spoke. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1452.6200000000001s)]
*  And I just didn't know if it was OK to bring up. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1455.14s)]
*  And that was the ending of Hitman, which I found kind of threw me for a loop. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1458.24s)]
*  And I think there's probably a way to talk about it without giving too much away. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1464.38s)]
*  Oh, I'm not a spoiler person. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1469.42s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1471.6200000000001s)]
*  Most people forget by the time they get there. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1472.82s)]
*  I don't believe things anyway. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1474.3799999999999s)]
*  So I don't mind spoilers. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1475.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1478.34s)]
*  Well, so Glenn Powell's character, Gary, commits a morally problematic act, to say the least. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1479.34s)]
*  And one of the ideas of the film is that sort of we and this is something we talked about [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1486.6s)]
*  earlier is that we all have the power to create our own identity. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1492.32s)]
*  And the film then suggests that that includes the identity of someone capable of murder [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1499.1s)]
*  and then living seemingly happily after having committed murder. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1508.1399999999999s)]
*  That's pretty dark. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1512.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1513.78s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1514.78s)]
*  I think most people kind of think they could probably handle that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1518.6599999999999s)]
*  The people who have flirted with this. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1521.9799999999998s)]
*  Everybody wants someone dead, probably. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1524.62s)]
*  I asked this around, it's like, could you murder someone? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1527.58s)]
*  I said, I've been in the film business over 30 years. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1529.46s)]
*  Of course I could murder somebody. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1532.6200000000001s)]
*  Who do you want dead? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1535.02s)]
*  No, I don't want anyone dead. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1536.02s)]
*  I don't want anyone dead. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1537.94s)]
*  I spread that out. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1539.66s)]
*  I don't want anything dead. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1540.9s)]
*  But I think there's a surprising number of people in the world who, to whatever degree, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1543.42s)]
*  voluntary or involuntary who have done something that's ended a life and can compartmentalize [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1549.78s)]
*  it away. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1557.46s)]
*  I don't know if you saw my documentary. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1558.46s)]
*  I was going to say what you're talking about now directly reminds me of the doc you did [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1561.42s)]
*  for God Save Texas, the HBO series. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1566.74s)]
*  Do you want to tell people what that documentary was about if they haven't seen it yet? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1569.22s)]
*  Well, it's an exploration of my hometown and the world I sort of grew up in and around. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1573.26s)]
*  It does kind of take on the death penalty, mainly from the people who are involved in [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1578.78s)]
*  the killing machine of it, the state sanctioned murder part of it. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1585.22s)]
*  You grew up in Huntsville, Texas, which is the town where Texas carries out its state [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1589.5s)]
*  executions? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1594.94s)]
*  That's where the prison system is based and they do the executions there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1596.6200000000001s)]
*  The questions posed by your documentary about how people basically find a way to coexist [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1601.78s)]
*  with what's really a moral abomination, which is the death penalty and the state sanctioned [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1609.46s)]
*  killing of other people, also reminded me of how you mentioned Jonathan Glazer's Zone [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1616.26s)]
*  of Interest was a film that you'd sort of admired that came out recently, which in sort [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1621.84s)]
*  of an even more extreme way asks similar questions about how people go about their [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1627.98s)]
*  lives right beside something awful happening. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1633.7s)]
*  And I wonder, do you feel like you have you have an understanding of how people are able [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1637.46s)]
*  to compartmentalize in that way? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1643.9s)]
*  Like, did you learn anything about people from making your documentary? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1645.9s)]
*  I've always been fascinated by that, you know, how we can compartmentalize. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1650.66s)]
*  You know, if you spread around the horror of abomination, you know, just think of the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1656.02s)]
*  way we treat animals. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1660.3s)]
*  If you eat meat, you are supporting a really super cruel, horrible system that creates [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1661.6999999999998s)]
*  incredible pain and suffering. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1670.34s)]
*  And you've been a vegetarian for a long time, right? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1673.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but I'm just saying the human psyche has no problem or what is done by your [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1675.2199999999998s)]
*  government in the name of this or that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1682.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, you can't make it through the modern world without, you know, pushing out the horror [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1684.1s)]
*  show that is a lot of life. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1689.82s)]
*  Right. So you pick your spots and what you can participate in affect change. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1692.1399999999999s)]
*  But, you know, we're all doing this little psychic dance to let ourselves think we're [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1698.86s)]
*  not horrible people. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1703.2199999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I have this whole, you know, we're suing the state of Texas right now. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1705.6999999999998s)]
*  I have this like political. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  Wait, I didn't know that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1712.3s)]
*  What are you suing Texas for? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1713.38s)]
*  For heat conditions in prison? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1715.5800000000002s)]
*  My friend, Bernie Tita, we just. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1717.22s)]
*  Oh, the real life inspiration for your movie, Bernie. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1719.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's the lead plaintiff in the seat. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1722.7800000000002s)]
*  We're going to hopefully change. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1725.2600000000002s)]
*  They have just an unbelievably cruel system where they don't have to air condition state [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1727.42s)]
*  prison cells. They do federal, they do local jails, they do for animal facilities, but [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1734.3400000000001s)]
*  somehow you don't have to for state. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1739.46s)]
*  And it's just horror. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1742.14s)]
*  I mentioned it in my documentary, the heat conditions, not only for corrections officers, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1742.9s)]
*  but for the inmates. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1747.38s)]
*  So we just there's this big lawsuit that we really think will change a lot of people's [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1749.66s)]
*  lives for the. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1755.7800000000002s)]
*  So, you go into political realms and you can that's a whole nother. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1757.3400000000001s)]
*  You could dedicate your entire life to trying to make the world a better place. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1762.94s)]
*  But I pick my spots, you know. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1766.94s)]
*  You know, can I bring up something? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1769.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1771.1000000000001s)]
*  It was only after the thing for the next hours I process and just all the thoughts I did [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1771.5800000000002s)]
*  not articulate very well. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1777.3000000000002s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1779.8600000000001s)]
*  Which is everything. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1780.38s)]
*  Most of what I say. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1781.7s)]
*  When you were asking if I felt it is a poignant important question, I think I just don't [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1785.74s)]
*  think I raised to the question. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1789.9s)]
*  It was. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1792.3000000000002s)]
*  What's your relation now to the work back then? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1794.22s)]
*  Are you as passionate? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1797.38s)]
*  Are you still seeing 600 moves a year? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1798.7s)]
*  Different. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1800.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1801.58s)]
*  And, you know, I really had to think about that. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1802.14s)]
*  And my analysis of that is. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1804.9s)]
*  You're a different person with different needs. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1808.78s)]
*  And a lot of that is based on just confidence. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1811.38s)]
*  When you're starting out in an art form or anything in life, you can't have confidence [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1815.14s)]
*  because you don't have experience, but you have to be pretty confident to say, make a [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1820.26s)]
*  film. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1823.94s)]
*  So the only way you counterbalance that lack of experience and confidence is just [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1824.86s)]
*  absolute passion, full on dedication, kind of fanatical spirit. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1830.58s)]
*  And I've had this conversation over the years with filmmaker friends. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1838.22s)]
*  Am I as passionate as I was in my 20s? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1843.5s)]
*  Would I risk my whole life if it was my best friend or my negative drowning? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1846.5s)]
*  Which do I save? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1851.62s)]
*  The 20 something self goes, I'm saving my film. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1853.62s)]
*  Good luck, fucker. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1856.06s)]
*  And now it's not that answer. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1857.58s)]
*  And I'm not ashamed to say that, you know, because all that passion doesn't just go [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1859.46s)]
*  away. It disperses a little healthfully. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1864.98s)]
*  I'm much more passionate in this world about a lot of things, you know, that the most [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1867.82s)]
*  fascinating relation we all have is obviously to ourselves at different times in our [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1872.3s)]
*  lives. And you look back and it's like, God, I'm not as passionate as I was at, you [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1876.3400000000001s)]
*  know, 25. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1881.54s)]
*  It's like, thank God that was a crazy fuck. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1882.74s)]
*  That person very insecure, very unkind. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1885.7s)]
*  You know, you're better than that now. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1888.78s)]
*  And you're chiller, maybe a better person, less selfish. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1891.7s)]
*  And you look back at it as kind of heroic or something necessary. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1896.3799999999999s)]
*  And it is. It absolutely is. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1899.74s)]
*  It makes total sense. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1901.46s)]
*  But I don't think you can do that forever. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1903.66s)]
*  If that's the only way you can work. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU&t=1906.26s)]
