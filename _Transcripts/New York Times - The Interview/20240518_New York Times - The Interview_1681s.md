# 'The Interview': Ayana Elizabeth Johnson Has an Antidote to Our Climate Delusions
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E)
*  Hey, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=0.0s)]
*  It's Sabrina. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=2.16s)]
*  Just popping in here to remind you that every weekend, on Saturday, we're going to be [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  sending you episodes of a new show our colleagues are making. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=7.5s)]
*  The show is called The Interview. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=11.06s)]
*  This week on the show, David Marchese talks with scientist Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=14.02s)]
*  Okay, here's the show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=27.08s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=29.32s)]
*  Back in 2018, a big climate report came out that really shook me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=34.04s)]
*  It painted a pretty dire picture of where we're heading, a climate that will likely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=38.0s)]
*  warm by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=41.72s)]
*  And it was a grim warning of what things will look like if we don't reverse course. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=44.72s)]
*  It now seems probable that we're going to blow past those climate targets. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=49.16s)]
*  And that's led to a lot of climate fear, pessimism, and activism rooted in anger. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=53.08s)]
*  But recently, there's been a growing counter-response to those darker feelings, including from some [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=58.4s)]
*  experts who have a clear view on what's coming. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  And that response is a cautious optimism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=65.84s)]
*  Though she doesn't go so far as to call herself hopeful, Dr. Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=68.44s)]
*  is one of those experts trying to change the mood on climate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=73.44s)]
*  She's a marine biologist, the co-founder of a think tank focused on the future of coastal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=76.88s)]
*  cities. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=81.28s)]
*  And she's also worked on climate policy, advising lawmakers and working with the EPA on climate [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=82.28s)]
*  solutions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  And she's got a new book that's due out this summer called What If We Get It Right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  Visions of Climate Futures. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=91.88s)]
*  That question, what if we get it right on climate, is one I think about a lot. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=93.96s)]
*  I'm skeptical, but I wish I weren't. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=98.56s)]
*  That's why I spoke with Johnson, to see if she can help me think and feel differently. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Here's our conversation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  So, I feel like over the last decade or so, the framing and discussion about the climate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=112.24s)]
*  crisis, a lot of it has been rooted in feelings of fear and anger and despair. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=121.0s)]
*  And I think more recently, there's been sort of a concerted effort to make a kind of a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=129.68s)]
*  vibe shift about how we talk about climate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=136.96s)]
*  One root and more. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=142.12s)]
*  Climate action needs way better vibes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=143.12s)]
*  It needs better vibes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  Why do you think there has been a shift towards talking about and thinking about solutions [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=146.36s)]
*  from a place of positive possibility? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=153.72s)]
*  We've had, at this point, it's been multiple decades of it's happening, it's coming, it's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=157.88s)]
*  here, it's bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's really bad. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  We should do something. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=167.36s)]
*  And of course, all that is factually accurate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=168.8s)]
*  But the question is, how do we convey that in a way that brings people in? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=171.84s)]
*  And projecting endless images of various apocalyptic scenarios is not super motivating. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=187.56s)]
*  It kind of, we went from like, OK, climate change, is this really happening? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=187.76s)]
*  To like, how serious is this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=194.24s)]
*  To, oh, God, it's so bad, let's just give up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=196.0s)]
*  And sort of skipped this middle step of all hands on deck. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=200.4s)]
*  Is it your sense or do you know if there's data that's been collected that, like, there [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=205.72s)]
*  are people who want to be involved in climate, but are being sort of rendered paralyzed by [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=210.12s)]
*  fear or despair, or that there are disinterested people who are just waiting to be motivated [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  by kind of a softer approach? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=223.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't think there's any one way that we should be communicating [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=225.24s)]
*  about climate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=228.56s)]
*  Some people are very motivated by the bad news. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=229.84s)]
*  They're like, oh, shit, got to avoid that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=232.16s)]
*  Like, whoa, that's terrifying. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=233.84s)]
*  Like, what can I do to prevent the worst case scenario? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=236.44s)]
*  Some people need that jolt and that's what gets them going. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=239.56s)]
*  Some people are overwhelmed by that and just don't know where to start. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=243.84s)]
*  I think there's this false dichotomy between hope and fear, as if there's one is the right [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=249.44s)]
*  way to communicate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=256.84s)]
*  When in fact, there's like a full spectrum of emotions that can be triggered by various [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=257.68s)]
*  things that you receive about the world around you, about news, about climate change. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=262.48s)]
*  And all of that is useful. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=268.0s)]
*  And so 62% of adults in the US say they feel a personal sense of responsibility to help [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=270.64s)]
*  produce global warming, but 51% say they don't know where to start. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=277.52s)]
*  And so to me, the question is, how do we harness and support millions of people in this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=282.28s)]
*  country alone who would like to be a part of the solutions? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  That's what we need is to live in a world where people are really focused on ensuring [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  a livable future on this planet, that we have moved beyond sort of the platitudes of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=303.68s)]
*  reduce, reuse, recycle. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=311.16s)]
*  And people don't even really pay attention to the first R there, the reduce people kind [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=313.16s)]
*  of ignore. But how can we really create a culture where everyone has a role to play [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=317.16s)]
*  and we have a choice of like, what are we going to do when faced with this problem? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=328.68s)]
*  Are we going to put our heads in the sand or are we going to pitch in? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=334.56s)]
*  You know, when you said the first R in reduce, reuse, recycle is one that a lot of people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=340.88s)]
*  ignore, you know, it makes me think about an idea that I think is a difficult one for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=346.12s)]
*  for lack of a better term, the average person in the global north. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  It's difficult for them to think about. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=357.12s)]
*  And that's the idea of sacrifice or sacrificing things that they take for granted or [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  comfort. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=363.76s)]
*  Or just less is more is maybe a nicer way to. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  People don't like sacrifice. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=368.4s)]
*  People don't like bans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=369.96s)]
*  But I think there's a way to frame that as like, this is an opportunity to just like [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=372.64s)]
*  live a different and better life. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=376.67999999999995s)]
*  So make the case for me that it's better. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=380.52s)]
*  Do you think there is a possible climate future that doesn't involve personal sacrifice? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=382.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't think consumerism is really that satisfying for most people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=390.64s)]
*  We're sort of taught that we need to keep up with these trends and like buy all this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=396.44s)]
*  stuff. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=400.28s)]
*  But it doesn't really make us happy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=400.6s)]
*  Happiness levels are declining. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=403.56s)]
*  People have fewer close friends. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=405.64s)]
*  It's not like the current status quo is awesome and we should be fighting to hold on to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=407.48s)]
*  it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=412.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=412.24s)]
*  We just like have a bunch of junk instead of being surrounded by beautiful, durable, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=412.4s)]
*  repairable things that we love. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  We've just like got a bunch of single use plastic garbage and just having like piles [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=423.79999999999995s)]
*  of garbage everywhere is not like super delightful. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=431.23999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=435.2s)]
*  Like having all this fossil fuel based plastic on every beach and in our drinking water [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  and in our rain and in our beer and in our seafood, which is currently the case. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=440.04s)]
*  It's not like that's a life I want to hold on to. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=445.44s)]
*  And so so often we think about the changes that are needed. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=448.64s)]
*  We don't actually look at both sides of the coin. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=454.6s)]
*  We think about, oh, this is going to be expensive or, oh, this is going to be inconvenient [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=458.2s)]
*  without thinking about like, do you know how inconvenient and expensive climate change [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=463.72s)]
*  is? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=468.4s)]
*  It is so much worse if you actually balance the cost of addressing the climate crisis [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=469.32s)]
*  starting now with the cost of not addressing it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=476.44s)]
*  I mean, those are wildly different orders of magnitude of inconvenience and dollars. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, just because you mentioned seafood, do you find that people get anxious ordering [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=486.72s)]
*  seafood when you go out for dinner with them? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=492.12s)]
*  Are you silently judging them? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=493.64s)]
*  I kind of wish they'd get more anxious. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=494.16s)]
*  No, I'm judging them out loud. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=496.36s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I will not let anyone eat octopus in front of me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  That is a hard line. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=505.2s)]
*  I mean, they're so smart. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=506.52s)]
*  They're so cool. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=507.96s)]
*  Like, why would you eat them? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=508.8s)]
*  I sometimes say when people are like, do you want to go have sushi? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=510.84s)]
*  I'm like, do you really want to have sushi with me? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=512.96s)]
*  And is it stupid for anybody to be buying a beach home these days? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=515.88s)]
*  I mean, if you like to set money on fire, it's a great plan. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=524.44s)]
*  I mean, the level of denial of the changes that are coming is really off the charts. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=526.36s)]
*  Like, and the way people joke about it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=530.7600000000001s)]
*  Like, go to the Hamptons to a cocktail party and tell someone that you're, you work on [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=533.8800000000001s)]
*  climate change and they'll be like, so how soon till I have beachfront property? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=537.7600000000001s)]
*  Because I'm like a few rows back right now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  Just like as if it's funny and we don't actually have to prepare for things. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=544.0400000000001s)]
*  But I get it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=548.6400000000001s)]
*  Like, it's really hard to get your head around the amount of change that's coming. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=549.24s)]
*  Does other people, what you see as other people's denial make you angry? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=552.96s)]
*  Anger is not really a primary emotion for me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=559.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=562.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm just a regular human. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=563.52s)]
*  I experience the full range of emotions. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=566.36s)]
*  Certainly anger is one of them, but heartache is another. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, if we think about just how much we're losing, that can be really hard. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=573.04s)]
*  Yeah, that can be really hard to deal with. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  And as a scientist, I mean, I look at all these projections and I could [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=583.08s)]
*  cry looking at a graph because I know the amount of suffering and ecological [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  loss that these numbers imply. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=592.96s)]
*  But honestly, I feel quite lucky to have been born with a brain chemistry [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=595.6s)]
*  that's not prone to depression because given the amount of bad news I take in [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=603.8800000000001s)]
*  every day, that would be really hard to deal with. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=607.44s)]
*  But there is kind of this soft denial of the climate crisis that I think is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=611.4000000000001s)]
*  extremely widespread, including for someone like myself where... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=619.5200000000001s)]
*  Oh, describe your soft climate denial. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=623.84s)]
*  Well, I feel like I understand the scope and honestly the horrifying [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=625.96s)]
*  scale of our climate future. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  And if that's true, why don't I do more than compost? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=637.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=645.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=646.56s)]
*  Well, it's... [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=647.24s)]
*  it's... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  you know, I'm supposed to be asking you these questions. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=650.64s)]
*  It's going to be much more informative for the audience actually, hearing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=652.68s)]
*  what you have to say, because we're all in that same boat. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=655.56s)]
*  Like if this is true... [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=657.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=659.24s)]
*  But, and this goes directly to the heart of one of my first questions for you. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=659.64s)]
*  It was like, what motivates behavior? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=663.28s)]
*  And I feel like, you know, for me, what small steps I've taken in response to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=665.5200000000001s)]
*  the climate crisis have been directly the result of feelings of anger and despair. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  Both my own... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=680.44s)]
*  Anger can be very motivating. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  Both my own and, you know, over the last 10 years, there's been more anger and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  fury about what's happening than ever before. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  And that is directly coterminous with the biggest changes we've seen in terms [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  of pro-climate policy, in terms of sort of public awareness of the problem. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  Politicians actually acknowledging that this is a problem. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=703.36s)]
*  All of this, to me, suggests that anger works. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  And then there's also, you know, and fear too, like they didn't get people [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=709.5999999999999s)]
*  to stop smoking by saying, think about how healthy you'll be if you don't do it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=712.4399999999999s)]
*  They got people to stop smoking by saying, this will really hurt you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=716.48s)]
*  if you continue to do it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=719.88s)]
*  And my inclination is to think that the same logic applies in climate. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=720.92s)]
*  And this is all sort of just tangential to the question you just asked me, which [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=725.52s)]
*  is why don't I do more? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=729.64s)]
*  And, you know, I think I honestly find it too big and too heartbreaking. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  And also I'm basically comfortable. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=742.0s)]
*  You know, I'm basically comfortable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=744.56s)]
*  I think a lot of us are dealing with this cognitive dissonance, right? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=747.16s)]
*  Between the lifestyles that we have, especially those of us who have nice [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  lifestyles and the knowledge that it's probably unsustainable. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=755.64s)]
*  And I think there are all these structural things that are in the way [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  of us shifting our lifestyles. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  You cannot take a train instead of a plane if that train doesn't exist. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=769.64s)]
*  I feel like there is obviously an enormous amount we can do as individuals, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=774.96s)]
*  but really the system around us is not set up for success. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=779.84s)]
*  I mean, this is why I focus on policy and not shaming individual people into [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=784.32s)]
*  like tiny actions in their own lives. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  Although we really do need to, they do add up, like we should all do more and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=790.0s)]
*  better, but I think this is the need and the opportunity. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=794.32s)]
*  This is why it's so important to have things like the almost $400 billion in [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=799.96s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act that help to seed this transformation. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  Like how can people afford to electrify their homes? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  We have millions of buildings in this country that need to be retrofit. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  We need to take out all these boilers. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=822.88s)]
*  We need to change our HVAC systems. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=825.0799999999999s)]
*  We need to put in heat pumps, induction stoves, electric water heaters, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  solar panels, green roofs, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=832.56s)]
*  Like there are these like big- [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=834.64s)]
*  And the grid has to be transformed to accommodate- [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=835.8s)]
*  The grid has to be transformed. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=837.8s)]
*  These are not things individuals have control over. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=839.56s)]
*  It's not that simple list of, you know, vote, donate, spread the word, protest, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=843.0s)]
*  lower your carbon footprint. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=848.48s)]
*  Like that's not enough. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=849.76s)]
*  And the fact that I know you went out of your way to make sure to interview a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=851.8s)]
*  climate person in the first few episodes of this show, like that's something [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=857.3199999999999s)]
*  only you can do, right? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=862.0s)]
*  You know, maybe I just have like an unexamined rage problem or anger issue, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=864.12s)]
*  but you know, it makes me mad to hear that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=871.0s)]
*  If you want to be mad, there are actual fossil fuel and big ag and advertising [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=874.16s)]
*  executives and politicians who are enabling all of this. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=879.8s)]
*  Like there are individual humans, actually a quite small group of them, who are [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  making these decisions that are impacting life on this planet for the 8 million or [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  so species that share it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=893.28s)]
*  And like that should make you mad because who are they to decide the future of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=894.9599999999999s)]
*  life on earth and to be so callous and so short-term thinking and so quarterly [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=900.36s)]
*  earnings, profit, shareholder, dividend driven, that they are jeopardizing [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=907.36s)]
*  biodiversity and quality of life for all of us. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=915.48s)]
*  But do you have, like are there historical models where massive social [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=919.12s)]
*  change was rooted in feelings of joy and positivity and not, you know, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=926.24s)]
*  indignation, moral outrage, conflict? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=935.08s)]
*  I don't think there's any movement that's just based on one emotion. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=939.32s)]
*  The ways we're experiencing the horrors of environmental destruction are [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=944.24s)]
*  motivating people to get in the streets. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=950.84s)]
*  But it's also like, we love nature. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=953.08s)]
*  We love clean rivers. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=957.2s)]
*  We love all of these things, like the caesaurus of Aspen leaves. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  Why would you not want to keep that around? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=967.16s)]
*  And it's just a matter of like, what do you do with those feelings? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=970.8s)]
*  Can you remind me what caesaurus means? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=975.32s)]
*  There's so many good nature words. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=977.64s)]
*  It is the sound of leaves in the wind. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=979.12s)]
*  Tell me other good nature words. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=981.8s)]
*  Heterocore is the smell of the soil after it first starts to rain. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=983.4s)]
*  Oh, that is a good one. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=988.84s)]
*  I mean, then there's like the Latin names of Caribbean fish species, like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=990.04s)]
*  Lactophis tricolor, there's so many good ones. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=994.24s)]
*  What's the non-Latin name of that fish species? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=998.48s)]
*  That's a smooth trunk fish. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  That's also a great name. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1002.6400000000001s)]
*  Also a good name. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1003.6s)]
*  Yeah, they're hilarious. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1005.0s)]
*  But, you know, I feel like I'm being like a David Downer here, but the, just to [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1006.6s)]
*  like respond to the idea of sacrifice, you know, it's, I just saw a study that if [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1013.24s)]
*  we follow the most plausible possible path to decarbonization by 2050, if we [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1018.5200000000001s)]
*  get there, the amount of carbon emissions that are already in the air will result [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1026.4s)]
*  in something like $38 trillion worth of damages every year. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1033.3200000000002s)]
*  Like that's baked in. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1037.64s)]
*  So what are we talking about really when we're talking about possibilities? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  What is it that you don't want to give up? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1044.64s)]
*  Um, do you know what the thing I don't want to give up is? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't want to give up the range of possibilities for my kids. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1054.56s)]
*  You know, they're, they're, they're seven and nine and I, you know, these are, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  these are totally selfish things to bring up, but you know, like. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  I assume you care about other people on the planet besides your children, but like. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1065.72s)]
*  My wife. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  You seem nice. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  I would hope things work out for you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1072.84s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1075.04s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  I just don't know how to think about the future. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  That's, that's like, I'm, I'm talking with you today and really like the fundamental [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1078.8s)]
*  thing is like, I'm trying to understand how to think about the future. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1082.88s)]
*  And I, I don't feel like I understand it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1085.7600000000002s)]
*  What you mentioned about wanting to secure a good future for your children. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1088.88s)]
*  This is the number one thing that drives people to do something about climate change. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1093.64s)]
*  It really does come down to love as an enormously powerful motivator. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1099.7600000000002s)]
*  I don't have children, but if I did, I would want to be able to look them in the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1106.88s)]
*  eye and say, I did everything I could to secure your future. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1110.68s)]
*  And I think most parents feel that way. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1115.16s)]
*  I feel that way about my God children for sure. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1117.48s)]
*  I feel that way about children that I barely know at all. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1120.16s)]
*  And so I feel like whether it's fear, anger, or love, anxiety, like all of those can [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1124.2s)]
*  lead to us further rolling up our sleeves. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1131.76s)]
*  That's the inflection that needs to happen for everybody. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess perhaps it's worth saying, it's okay not to be hopeful. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1142.52s)]
*  I feel like there's so much emphasis in our society on being hopeful as if that's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  the answer to unlocking everything. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1155.04s)]
*  I'm not a hopeful person. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1157.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not an optimist. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1160.12s)]
*  I see the data. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1162.8s)]
*  I see what's coming. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  But I also see the full range of possible futures. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1166.8s)]
*  I feel like there's so much that we could create. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1170.36s)]
*  It's not going to be perfect, but yeah, how can we each be a part of getting it as [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1177.8s)]
*  right as possible? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  I think what getting it right could look like would be a good thing for us to pick [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1185.64s)]
*  back up on when we speak again next week. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1191.72s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1194.52s)]
*  After the break, my second call with Dr. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1199.52s)]
*  Johnson, I asked her more about specific solutions to the climate crisis and what [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1201.88s)]
*  she thinks might stop us from pursuing them. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1206.64s)]
*  I think I don't engage as deeply as I would if I were to be honest. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1209.96s)]
*  Don't engage as deeply as I should with the political divisions in America and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1213.84s)]
*  around the world as being a really, really enormous barrier to getting any of this done. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1220.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1244.16s)]
*  Hey, Ayanna, how are you? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1244.96s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1246.4s)]
*  This is The Interview. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1247.72s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1248.96s)]
*  You know, one of the things that you had said near the end of our first conversation [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1251.96s)]
*  was the phrase that's the title of your book, What if We Get It Right? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1257.24s)]
*  Can you give specific examples of what getting it right on climate looks like? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1261.8s)]
*  What are things that are within our grasp that we can get right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1267.4s)]
*  So many things. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, we know how to transition to renewable energy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1273.3200000000002s)]
*  We know how to insulate buildings. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1276.72s)]
*  We know how to put on green roofs or reflective roofs on buildings. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1279.52s)]
*  We know how to improve public transit. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  We know how to shift our transportation towards electric. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1286.16s)]
*  We know how to avoid food waste, which is actually a huge source of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1290.0800000000002s)]
*  greenhouse gas emissions as food is rotting and releasing methane. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1293.88s)]
*  We know how to just reduce our consumption. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1298.48s)]
*  There's a million things we could do. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1302.24s)]
*  Of course, there's room for innovation, but there's absolutely [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1305.4s)]
*  nothing that we need to wait for. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1308.68s)]
*  So I'm always very impressed when people have what feels like very reasonable, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1312.8s)]
*  plausible answers to these big questions about life on earth. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1320.28s)]
*  But if you're tossing and turning in your bed at night, what skepticism [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1326.12s)]
*  do you have about your own ideas? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1333.56s)]
*  Like what might you be wrong about? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  I think I don't engage as deeply as I should with the political divisions [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1337.8s)]
*  in America and around the world as being a really, really enormous [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1348.84s)]
*  barrier to getting any of this done. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1354.92s)]
*  I'm not in the dark about it, but it's not something that infuses my daily life [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1357.88s)]
*  and work and every time it hits me, I'm just like, how can we get past this? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1364.7600000000002s)]
*  Like the question of this upcoming election, the stakes are so high and we [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1371.68s)]
*  have so many people who do not appreciate the risks that we're facing [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1377.12s)]
*  and so are not motivated to do much to address them. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1386.6s)]
*  So unfortunately, the climate crisis is going to give us a lot of tests for how [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1391.04s)]
*  we can collaborate across various social divisions, but a lot of the solutions [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1395.76s)]
*  to climate change people agree on, even if they don't agree on the problem, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1401.76s)]
*  people are very excited about the new battery manufacturing plants in like [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1405.64s)]
*  deeply red parts of this country because they're good jobs. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1410.1200000000001s)]
*  Texas and Iowa have the most wind energy of any place in the U S because it's [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1413.88s)]
*  profitable, so the economics of the transition to renewable energy and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1420.2800000000002s)]
*  implementing climate solutions make a lot of sense until we may have to just [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1426.5600000000002s)]
*  skip over some of these divisions and let self-interest in various ways guide [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1431.72s)]
*  us towards where we need to go, even if we don't all agree on exactly the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  contours of the problem. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1445.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, I got to say that there was a response that I gave to you based on a [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1449.3200000000002s)]
*  question that you asked me in our prior conversation that I've really been [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1456.84s)]
*  thinking about since we spoke and I was talking about the context of the future [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1461.84s)]
*  and sacrifice or if we might have to sacrifice and you would ask me what I [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1467.4399999999998s)]
*  was so afraid of giving up and I was really thinking about that since we spoke [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1472.08s)]
*  and I concluded that I think the answer that I gave you in the moment was kind of [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  cockamamie. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1482.68s)]
*  So I want to try and give you what I think is a more truthful answer and the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1483.96s)]
*  real answer to why I might be reluctant to change behaviors or be scared of the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1490.0400000000002s)]
*  future in some ways maybe actually has more to do with some selfishness. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1496.92s)]
*  That's good of you to admit. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1503.24s)]
*  I think we all want to hold on to our comforts. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1504.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, is there sort of an antidote to that kind of thinking? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1507.0400000000002s)]
*  And then also, is it possible it's like that just is human nature? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1511.12s)]
*  I think the answer is community. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1515.32s)]
*  We have to be responsible to more than ourselves. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1517.7199999999998s)]
*  We have to feel an obligation to more than just our children. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1521.56s)]
*  It can't just be a selfish desire to hold on to what we currently have, which is [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1527.8s)]
*  even that illogical because the world is going to change around us and the things [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1532.8s)]
*  that we have, we won't be able to hold on to because we can't actually control all [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1537.24s)]
*  of society and live in a bubble. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1542.04s)]
*  And so you can maybe rip really tightly onto your comforts in the short term. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1544.52s)]
*  But the more we resist being part of the collective solution, the less likely that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1552.4s)]
*  collective solution is to happen. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1559.04s)]
*  I mean, in a sense, you're echoing a bit of this bunker mentality, right? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  Where we have these wealthy people who are buying up land in New Zealand and [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1568.36s)]
*  wherever else, trying to just save themselves. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1574.1999999999998s)]
*  And to me, that seems like such a sad way to see the world, right? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1580.08s)]
*  Like, do you want to live in a bunker for a year eating canned rations? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1584.6s)]
*  Like, is that the life we want to build? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  Or do we just all try to make sure we have a world where there's enough for [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1591.8s)]
*  everybody, where no one takes too much and we share what we have? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1597.0s)]
*  I'd rather share. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E&t=1602.48s)]
