# Melinda French Gates Is Ready to Take Sides
**New York Times - The Interview:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=6.08s)]
*  I have a lot of female friends who are in the midst of midlife reinventions. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=9.64s)]
*  Divorce, job changes, aging, navigating, all of that, as you can imagine, is hard. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=14.56s)]
*  Doing it in the glare of the public eye, even with buckets of money, has its own unique [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=22.28s)]
*  challenges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=27.72s)]
*  Which is why I was so intrigued when one half of one of the most powerful philanthropic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=29.04s)]
*  couples in the world announced a few months ago that she was striking out on her own. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  In May, Melinda French Gates said that she was leaving the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=39.56s)]
*  which she co-founded in 2000. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=44.68s)]
*  Despite a divorce from Bill a few years ago, the two had continued working together, and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=47.16s)]
*  it was understood that Melinda was a crucial part of what made that foundation so effective. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=52.28s)]
*  It's hard to overstate what an earthquake her departure was in the world of big donor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=58.72s)]
*  charitable giving. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=63.72s)]
*  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, soon to be called just the Gates Foundation, is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=64.72s)]
*  the largest philanthropic organization in the United States by far, and it's given [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=69.96s)]
*  away nearly $80 billion since its inception. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  With help from fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, the Gateses have wielded enormous influence [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=78.92s)]
*  through their charitable donations, to causes as varied as their much lauded global childhood [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=83.44s)]
*  vaccination initiative, to their more controversial push to change standards for public education [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=88.64s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=94.72s)]
*  The act of walking away from all that would have been surprising enough. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=96.68s)]
*  But then Melinda did something she had never done while at the Gates Foundation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=99.84s)]
*  She entered the political fray, endorsing President Biden and saying that she was going [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=104.58s)]
*  to focus her resources on supporting women's rights in the United States, including abortion [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=109.36s)]
*  rights. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=114.84s)]
*  When we spoke earlier this month, she told me why she feels so much urgency to get involved [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=116.04s)]
*  in these issues now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=120.8s)]
*  I should say this was before Biden dropped out of the presidential race. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=122.48s)]
*  She's since endorsed Kamala Harris. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=126.0s)]
*  We also talked about life after divorce, raising rich kids, her new YouTube series called Moments [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=128.76s)]
*  That Make Us, and her evolving views on how to use her own money. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=134.18s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Melinda French Gates. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=139.32s)]
*  Melinda, you are in this big moment of transition. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=145.96s)]
*  You've been through a divorce. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  You're about to turn 60. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  You've left the Gates Foundation after over two decades. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=155.96s)]
*  Has it felt like a big identity shift? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=161.0s)]
*  Not really, because I am still the same person that I was when I was at the foundation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=164.32s)]
*  I'm still doing the work on behalf of women and girls. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=170.96s)]
*  It was a decision that I gave a lot of careful thought and reflection when I was making it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=175.12s)]
*  While you're doing that, I think I had to get a bit used to the idea the last few months. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=182.44s)]
*  Certainly the transition itself had some sad moments. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=187.96s)]
*  It's hard to say goodbye to employees who I love and care about deeply, but it's also [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=190.46s)]
*  had some uplifting moments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=195.16s)]
*  People stop and tell you what they really think about you, and you tell them what you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=197.32s)]
*  think about them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  It hasn't felt like an identity shift in any way. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=203.12s)]
*  What did people tell you? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=206.68s)]
*  Was there anything that surprised you, moved you, upset you? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Hearing about my impact on people's pivotal moments in their career or in a decision we [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=214.6s)]
*  were making, those were ones that I would say touched me very deeply. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=220.28s)]
*  Speaking of pivotal, you have got your own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=225.92s)]
*  started in 2015. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=231.82s)]
*  You're doing this new interview series that will go up on YouTube where you talk with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=234.2s)]
*  famous and important women in different decades of their lives from their 30s to their 80s. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=239.48s)]
*  All these things coming together in this moment, how are you trying to define yourself and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  your work now? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  What's connecting all these new endeavors? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=252.96s)]
*  Well, I would say that it's really my passion to make the world better on behalf of others, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=255.56s)]
*  and particularly women and girls and minorities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=266.12s)]
*  And I just over the years came to really learn that we have to invest in women and girls [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=269.36s)]
*  and others because we send people, young people out into society that wasn't built [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=276.32s)]
*  for them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=281.96s)]
*  And in my 60th birthday interviews, I wanted to bring these women into the conversation [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  because they've been seminal to me in my thinking about these issues over years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=289.0s)]
*  And I thought there were things they could teach all of us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=296.64s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=300.88s)]
*  I mean, what resonated? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=301.88s)]
*  Well, Billie Jean King. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=302.88s)]
*  I watched her when I was nine years old. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=304.68s)]
*  I remember where I was when we watched her match. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=307.76s)]
*  And to stop and think how far the world has come because of her courage and the courage [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=311.64s)]
*  of so many who followed her. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  It was joyful to sit with these women and to hear about their courageous moments, but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=320.32s)]
*  also where they've found themselves now in life. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering when you realized that you could bring something as a woman into the world [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=330.24s)]
*  that might be different than maybe the male perspective. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  I would say I didn't come to that realization until about 2010. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=341.6s)]
*  So I had been traveling by that time internationally for over a decade. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=347.0s)]
*  It was around 2010 that I just realized my perspective as a woman and as a mother and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=353.68s)]
*  the things that women were willing to tell me when I would go out on these field visits [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=361.04s)]
*  and I would be out in a village or in a township. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=366.8s)]
*  When the men had left the conversation to go back to the fields, boy, what I heard from [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  women was just unbelievable, really about their lives and how they were struggling to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=376.72s)]
*  make ends meet, put food on the table. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  The difference a contraceptive made if they could space the births of their children, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=385.68s)]
*  how it was actually a crisis for them at times if they had another child that they couldn't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=391.16s)]
*  feed. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=395.24s)]
*  And it animated me and I realized, my gosh, if they're willing to have these courageous [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=396.8s)]
*  conversations with me, I need to bring that deeply into the work. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=401.52s)]
*  I'm wondering when you sat there in 2010, you'd just been in the field and you're sitting [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=407.12s)]
*  there listening to women tell you their stories. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=410.84s)]
*  And I've been in similar situations as a journalist and a former foreign correspondent where all [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=414.12s)]
*  of a sudden you're getting a perspective that perhaps hadn't been given before. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=419.04s)]
*  How do you change the course of a ship, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=424.68s)]
*  The Gates Foundation was known for being very science-based, very sort of looking for very [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  clear, what am I saying here? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  Metrics, data. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=439.68s)]
*  Metrics, data. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=440.68s)]
*  And not to say that women's issues can't be measured in that way, but it is different, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=441.68s)]
*  isn't it? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=447.04s)]
*  It is different. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  And I had to realize and get the foundation to realize that we didn't have much data as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  a world on women, which was shocking when I started to look into it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=457.68s)]
*  And so I had to set the foundation and our partners off on a direction to start collecting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=462.04s)]
*  data because we did need it to know how to invest properly. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=466.64s)]
*  But to put a stake in the ground to turn us as a foundation, I first did an article in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=471.16s)]
*  Science Magazine to say to the foundation, we are turning in this direction. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=476.88s)]
*  And then I knew it was going to take some time and I would have to be patient and make [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  sure we hired the right people, found the right president to run this, started to move [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=488.2s)]
*  resources into it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=493.48s)]
*  And it took us, quite honestly, a decade. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=494.8s)]
*  Just to put this into context, the foundation was, or is rather, the second largest philanthropic [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=498.36s)]
*  foundation in the world. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  It's given away almost $80 billion. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  It has an endowment that's $75 billion, bigger than the GDP of some countries. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  What is it that you understood that a foundation of the size of the Willa Melinda Gates Foundation [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=516.16s)]
*  could do? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=522.04s)]
*  I understood that when we headed in a certain direction, for instance, vaccines early in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  our work, we thought it would save children's lives. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=530.76s)]
*  We were able to prove that it did and many, many others went in that direction with us. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=534.34s)]
*  So I knew that if I put a stake in the ground around women and girls, I was making a statement, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=540.4200000000001s)]
*  a strong statement that we're headed in this direction, and I knew that we would bring [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  data and rigor and science to it, and I knew others would follow us. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  Who did you have to convince? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=557.74s)]
*  Was it Bill or was it also the board? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=559.34s)]
*  I mean, I imagine it must have been Bill first, and what was that conversation like? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=563.54s)]
*  Well, there was no board. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=568.02s)]
*  The board of trustees was me, Bill, and Warren. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=570.42s)]
*  And yes, it took some convincing of Bill, and that didn't happen all at once. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  That was over time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=578.9s)]
*  That was with good data, with good backing from other people, but it also the leadership [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=580.66s)]
*  of the foundation. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=586.3399999999999s)]
*  I remember one male scientist who I respected greatly, and he respected me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=587.5s)]
*  He was in the agricultural division, and when he retired, he said to me, Melinda, the first [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=593.2199999999999s)]
*  time you said out loud on stage that we needed to think about women in our agricultural work [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=599.2199999999999s)]
*  and what beans they would want to cook and grow. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=607.5s)]
*  He said, I thought it was a joke. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=611.38s)]
*  And he said, but over my career, I came to see that they will only cook certain beans [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=614.18s)]
*  because it takes a certain amount of time to cook them. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=619.38s)]
*  They're the ones who do the unpaid labor. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=621.78s)]
*  And he said, but I didn't really see it until I sent my two daughters out into the workforce. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=624.5s)]
*  And I've seen it a lot with men over and over again that until they have daughters or someone [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=630.78s)]
*  in their family that really hits these barriers, they often are not convincing or until you [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  have incredibly good data. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=644.42s)]
*  You've mentioned vaccines. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=647.3s)]
*  You've mentioned all these initiatives towards women. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=650.02s)]
*  There was, of course, some criticism for some of the swings that the foundation did take, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=652.42s)]
*  especially for the work you did on K-12 education in America. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=658.5799999999999s)]
*  You poured money into the Common Core Initiative, which many argue didn't work. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  Critics said that that was undemocratic, the big push to try and change an entire system [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=668.14s)]
*  of education in this country. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't want to relitigate it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=675.06s)]
*  I am curious, though, as you're talking, how your thinking has evolved about using the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=677.34s)]
*  power of philanthropy to do good and enact priorities. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=685.1s)]
*  Look, we always have to be humble because, as Warren Buffett says, you are taking on [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=691.42s)]
*  some of the hardest problems in society. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=700.1s)]
*  The ones that society has left behind because they are hard. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=702.94s)]
*  And so I think the lesson in that is that you have to, though, bring people along with [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=707.46s)]
*  you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=713.1400000000001s)]
*  And I think some of the mistakes made along the way were ones of not thinking about, but [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=714.1400000000001s)]
*  what is the community asking us for? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=719.9000000000001s)]
*  What are they saying they need? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=722.74s)]
*  And what will they accept, right, both abroad and in the United States? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=725.1s)]
*  And fundamentally, I will still say I absolutely believe that every child in the United States [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=732.08s)]
*  and, quite frankly, around the world deserves a great education. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=738.08s)]
*  It is the thing that will change their life. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=741.76s)]
*  So you still believe in the big swings? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=744.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=747.76s)]
*  Have you thought about the manner of giving? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=748.76s)]
*  Because as you know, there is this debate in philanthropy right now about how money [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  should be dispersed. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  As we mentioned, the Gates Foundation is known for one sort of way of doing that, which is [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=759.72s)]
*  data-driven. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=763.5400000000001s)]
*  It's known as strategic philanthropy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  And I'm wondering about the second model because that's called trust-based philanthropy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=768.64s)]
*  And basically, you give money to organizations closest to the issues that you care about, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=775.84s)]
*  no strings attached. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=780.76s)]
*  And I'm curious, are you moving also in that direction? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=781.76s)]
*  I'm probably somewhere a little bit more in the middle of that, still leaning towards [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=786.32s)]
*  data-driven, but certainly a little bit more in the trust-based model because I don't intend [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=791.84s)]
*  to build up a large organization. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=798.6s)]
*  And I do believe that there are many, many partners on the ground, and I know there are, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=801.34s)]
*  I've met them, and I don't think I know all of them, who do incredible work but often [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=807.68s)]
*  don't get funded. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=812.76s)]
*  And I feel like this work, when done closer to the ground, sometimes can have an even [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=814.56s)]
*  larger lasting impact. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=820.4s)]
*  There is, of course, another famous female philanthropy, Mackenzie Scott, who is the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=823.68s)]
*  ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=827.88s)]
*  She's been taking the trust-based approach for quite some time. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  You were working with her for a while. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=835.66s)]
*  Why did that stop? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=837.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=839.28s)]
*  Mackenzie and I are definitely friends, and so I'm not going to say a lot about her or [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=843.56s)]
*  her philanthropy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=849.16s)]
*  I have great respect, huge respect for what she's doing. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=850.16s)]
*  I think you make a false assumption to think that we may not work together more in the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  future. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=857.56s)]
*  So let's just wait and see. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, we talk about our philanthropy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=861.1199999999999s)]
*  She's very proud of what she's doing, and I think she should be. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=864.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm proud of what I'm doing, and I think there may be more intersections in the future, but [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=869.0s)]
*  we'll see. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=874.24s)]
*  It just depends on where she decides she wants to go and where I decide I want to go. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=875.24s)]
*  But she certainly has had an effect on me and philanthropy, and I hope I've had an effect [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=879.52s)]
*  on her. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=883.8599999999999s)]
*  Do you think women give differently? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  I think we haven't run the experiment fully yet. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=889.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=893.24s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  It's only been in the last decade that you're seeing women really come into their own in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=896.4s)]
*  philanthropy. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=905.04s)]
*  I mean, we have 100 years of history in philanthropy before that, but it was really the men who [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=906.04s)]
*  controlled the resources. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=911.92s)]
*  And I even see it still with couples who are married. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=915.0s)]
*  Quite honestly, some of the women talk about they still have to go to their husband to [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=918.28s)]
*  get the permission to do certain things they want to do in philanthropy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=922.32s)]
*  So give us another 25 years, and then ask me the question again. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=926.24s)]
*  Then I think we will know, do women give differently or not? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=932.2s)]
*  I think we're just at the beginning of understanding that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=935.5200000000001s)]
*  The sample size you're saying is too small? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=938.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=941.12s)]
*  I mean, both you and Mackenzie Scott are giving in ways that aren't necessarily contingent [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=942.12s)]
*  on your names being emblazoned on the side of a building, which is what we think of with [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=949.36s)]
*  perhaps more masculine giving. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  I think I can see the argument both ways because putting a face on philanthropy, which happened [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=957.44s)]
*  with you and Bill, helps bring awareness to causes, helps, I think, increase trust because [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  you know who the person is behind the organization. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=970.44s)]
*  But there's also this other argument that anonymity or more low profile giving keeps [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=975.8399999999999s)]
*  the focus on the work. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=981.24s)]
*  So how do you think about that balance? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=982.92s)]
*  For me personally, I don't need my name on the side of a building in perpetuity. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=986.4s)]
*  That's not what I'm about. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=992.78s)]
*  I'm about how do I move society forward for the betterment of everybody. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=993.78s)]
*  And so that, you know, my grandchildren and my grandchildren's grandchildren get to live [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=999.16s)]
*  in an even better world than I do now. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1004.36s)]
*  But it doesn't take my name on a building to change society, nor do I actually think [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1008.4s)]
*  it's helpful. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  Not helpful why? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1015.64s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, I'll give you a specific example. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1016.64s)]
*  When our kids were very young, I finally went to Bill, we had this conversation that he [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  readily agreed to. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1024.52s)]
*  And I said, you know, universities come to us and if we do a large gift because we want [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1025.52s)]
*  to, it seems to make sense in the area that we're working in. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1031.56s)]
*  They want us to put our name on a building. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1034.6s)]
*  I don't think that's a good idea. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1036.12s)]
*  Because for our children going to those institutions, they don't want to go sit in a building that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1038.52s)]
*  has their parents name on it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1043.12s)]
*  Thank goodness we did that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1045.04s)]
*  Because literally, one of my kids wouldn't look at a university that had any name on [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1046.68s)]
*  a building from us because they want to cut their own path in life. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1051.8s)]
*  I think it's a sign you've got good kids. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1056.6s)]
*  Because I know I think some kids who might be like, yeah, mom and dad have their name [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1058.16s)]
*  on the side of the building and that's going to make me the big person on campus. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  And you know what, I went to school with some of those kids at Duke University and I vowed [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  to myself that if I ever had resources at my disposal, those were not the kind of children [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1071.68s)]
*  I wanted to raise. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  You saw that at Duke and it stuck with you? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1079.8000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1083.24s)]
*  Kids both in undergraduate and in business school who are all about the name, right? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1085.08s)]
*  You know, or the thing they had or the access to the whatever, I'll make it up, ski house, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1092.48s)]
*  you know, or and I just thought, gosh, I hope I'm never the mom that has those kids that's [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1098.04s)]
*  bragging about the material things they have or the name they have. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1103.32s)]
*  How do you ground kids not to become those people? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1108.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, they had an allowance. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1114.9199999999998s)]
*  So we absolutely did not just buy them things. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1118.48s)]
*  And they either had to buy that with their allowance or put it on their wish list that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1122.84s)]
*  maybe they get it from their grandparents or us on their birthday or Christmas. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1127.6s)]
*  We said to them from a very early age, you know, you really are not allowed to tell other [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1133.56s)]
*  people that we, you know, how we flew on this trip back and forth. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1139.08s)]
*  Like otherwise it will separate you from other children. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1143.12s)]
*  And so I think it was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in a very middle class household [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1147.2s)]
*  where, you know, money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1154.08s)]
*  not. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1158.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1159.08s)]
*  And I thought that was a good principle to have. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1160.08s)]
*  And I have to say, again, Mackenzie was helpful to me in this. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1161.9s)]
*  I could see a bit how she was parenting. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1167.1000000000001s)]
*  And I knew we had quite similar philosophies, actually. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1172.1000000000001s)]
*  We were close-ish, not as close then, but I knew she was trying to raise her kids literally [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1176.38s)]
*  just down the street from me in essentially the same way. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1182.7s)]
*  I know we only have a few minutes left. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1187.3400000000001s)]
*  And I do want to ask you about this other new part of your life, which is post-divorce. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1188.9s)]
*  You said recently in an interview that you're sort of enjoying this moment and I wanted [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1193.66s)]
*  you to say more about that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1200.18s)]
*  What does that mean, Melinda French-Gates, in this new era in your personal life? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1202.5s)]
*  It just means I get to be around the people I want to be around and do the things that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1209.3000000000002s)]
*  I want to do. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1214.74s)]
*  And it's lovely. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1215.74s)]
*  So I just had no idea that it would be such an opening, right? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1217.38s)]
*  An opening to be closer to my kids in the way I want to be. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1222.8200000000002s)]
*  I am stripped of some obligations, right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1228.94s)]
*  I'm not balancing two large extended families anymore. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1233.7800000000002s)]
*  So it just gives me more time and I'm really enjoying it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1237.48s)]
*  I'm thinking about this next chapter for you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1243.3799999999999s)]
*  And you've become more political. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1246.06s)]
*  Did you have to think about the trade-offs in making your positions clear, saying that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1249.94s)]
*  you're going to actively support candidates? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1255.62s)]
*  Because obviously at the Gates Foundation, that was never the way you all did business [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1257.44s)]
*  there because you were often in partnership with government entities like USAID. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1261.46s)]
*  And so that is irrespective of the administration and taking political positions. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1266.7s)]
*  I imagine wouldn't have been well viewed. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1272.02s)]
*  Can you just talk me through how you thought, okay, I have to do this now? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1275.18s)]
*  After the Dobbs decision, I knew I had to speak out in favor of women's rights. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1280.1399999999999s)]
*  And if there was a candidate who is against women's rights and says terrible things about [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1290.3799999999999s)]
*  women, there is no way I could vote for that person. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1297.7s)]
*  And I felt that that decision, because of all the downstream repercussions it has for [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1301.76s)]
*  maternal health, for black women, for places, deserts where women can't even go now to get [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1308.44s)]
*  good maternal care in the United States, all the downstream effects that are coming and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1316.16s)]
*  will continue to come from that decision are so severe. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1320.96s)]
*  I thought, you know, if I really believe in women in our country and women's rights, I [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1325.0s)]
*  need to speak up because women are the ones that are going to make or break this election [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1329.8s)]
*  and women in battleground states speaking up for what they want for their rights and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1333.72s)]
*  for our democracy. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1339.92s)]
*  That's why I felt it was so important. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1341.32s)]
*  But yes, it was a very, it was not a decision I came to easily. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  I knew I would get attacked. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1349.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I care so much about women's rights. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1351.08s)]
*  What did you worry about when you were thinking, should I say this or should I not? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1355.58s)]
*  I knew there would be people who were against it or would say, okay, now she's always in [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1362.06s)]
*  one camp. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1366.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's not true. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1367.58s)]
*  I've always been actually, the one thing I have always been is a centrist. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1368.78s)]
*  I have voted Republican in some elections, I voted Democratic in others. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1372.86s)]
*  And I think that will also be true going forward. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1376.86s)]
*  So it was more just, it's because we're just, we're so polarized as a nation, as we all [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1380.08s)]
*  know, that it's hard to even have a sane conversation or debate when you have a different point [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1385.84s)]
*  of view than somebody. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1393.08s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1394.32s)]
*  One of those people, of course, who did come out and attack you is Elon Musk. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1396.84s)]
*  I'm sure you saw a couple of weeks ago, Elon posted on X about you endorsing Biden. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1402.12s)]
*  He said that your political activism might be, quote, the downfall of Western civilization. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1407.52s)]
*  I'm wondering if you have any comment on that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1413.56s)]
*  I thought it was silly. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1416.4s)]
*  Did it upset you because? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1418.02s)]
*  No. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1419.52s)]
*  I mean, here's one thing that always has confounded me about society is I've just watched over [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1420.52s)]
*  the years. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1427.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, we will ask tech leaders. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1430.5800000000002s)]
*  I have seen tech leaders interviewed about their parenting style, a male who has spent, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1433.4s)]
*  you know, 60 hours at his company that week. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1439.5600000000002s)]
*  And I'm sure he's a fantastic CEO and has done a great job, maybe or maybe not in their [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1442.96s)]
*  company. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1447.24s)]
*  But then they get asked about parenting questions and they spew all this stuff and you think [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1448.24s)]
*  something doesn't add up here. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1452.52s)]
*  So some of these comments to me are just kind of silly. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1454.8000000000002s)]
*  I do want to ask you about Warren Buffett. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1460.3200000000002s)]
*  He just made his new will public. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1462.76s)]
*  Earlier he had said he was going to give a huge amount of money to the Gates Foundation. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1465.44s)]
*  And now he's saying he's going to start his own trust headed by his children instead. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1469.64s)]
*  And so I was wondering if you were surprised by that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1474.58s)]
*  And what do you think is behind it? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1477.56s)]
*  No, this decision did not surprise me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1479.04s)]
*  It's been a decision that I think he's been coming to over time. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1481.98s)]
*  And I was aware that he was making this decision. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1486.16s)]
*  So I think this has just been, it's been a good evolution, I think, to his thinking [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1488.88s)]
*  on how he wants to do his giving. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1493.8200000000002s)]
*  An evolution just in what way? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1496.88s)]
*  So that he has his own priorities and his family has his own priorities? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1499.3400000000001s)]
*  I think that's a question you should ask Warren, right? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1506.6000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  But I've got you. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  But I don't want to put words in his mouth. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  But I think it's just, it's been a coming to over time, right? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1515.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1518.68s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I just find interesting about you and Warren and that [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1519.68s)]
*  relationship is that even though he's 30 some years older than you, I think of you and Bill [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1523.0s)]
*  and him as this one generation of billionaire activists with a particular and sort of quite [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1528.64s)]
*  traditional approach to philanthropy. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1535.08s)]
*  And now there's like this other group of activists. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1539.04s)]
*  I'm thinking of Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey and Peter Thiel. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1542.16s)]
*  And maybe it's just personalities. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1547.16s)]
*  But does it feel like a different era to you to see this generational shift among the super [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1548.5800000000002s)]
*  wealthy and how they see and use their place in the culture? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1553.88s)]
*  The people you just name have not been very philanthropic yet. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1559.28s)]
*  They use their voice and they use their megaphones, but I would not call those men philanthropists. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1563.2s)]
*  Go look at their record of actually giving money to society. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1569.56s)]
*  It's not big. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1574.52s)]
*  So you put Bill and me and Warren in a class of philanthropists doing things in a certain [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1576.3999999999999s)]
*  way. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1581.72s)]
*  But I don't think you can then say, okay, well, let's compare to this group over here [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1582.72s)]
*  who are non-philanthropists. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1587.3999999999999s)]
*  Those are non-philanthropists, in my opinion. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1588.98s)]
*  What do you think's at the root of people like you choosing to go one way and people [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1591.76s)]
*  choosing to do something else or not choosing to do anything at all? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1596.64s)]
*  I think we've had that in society for a long time. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1600.4s)]
*  You have some wealthy people who choose to give their money back and some who don't. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1603.52s)]
*  What we've tried to do with the Giving Pledge is to get people to sign on to commit to giving [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1609.44s)]
*  away half their wealth during their lifetime or afterwards. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1615.0600000000002s)]
*  And what I will say is that as I see, this was the first year we actually had the original [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1619.72s)]
*  signators of the Giving Pledge and the next generation, the generation who will inherit [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1625.88s)]
*  the wealth together in a room. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1632.92s)]
*  And boy, when we put those two together, it was such an interesting conversation because [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1635.72s)]
*  yes, the younger people in the room are seeing society in a different way and are seeing [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1640.3200000000002s)]
*  issues that they want to further and to forward. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1646.48s)]
*  Some of them are even saying to their parents, hey, give us the purse strings earlier so [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1650.44s)]
*  that we can do this and we can do it in a new way. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1654.4199999999998s)]
*  And so I will be very excited to see how that plays out over time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1657.6599999999999s)]
*  After the break, I called Melinda back to ask more about going it alone. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1669.22s)]
*  I'm just ready to do this. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1673.98s)]
*  I have 25 years of experience. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1675.6599999999999s)]
*  I know what I want to do and I don't want to have to negotiate with somebody else. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1678.4199999999998s)]
*  Will we go over here? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1683.3s)]
*  Will we change over there? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1684.3s)]
*  I was just ready to be on my own. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1686.06s)]
*  Hi, it's Melinda. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1702.34s)]
*  Hi, it's Lulu. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1703.74s)]
*  Hi, good to speak with you again. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1705.8600000000001s)]
*  Good to speak with you, too. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1708.34s)]
*  So whose challenge you're thinking most on women's issues? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1710.18s)]
*  Oh, gosh, probably my children. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1715.3000000000002s)]
*  My youngest Phoebe had been pushing on me for quite some time to not just do reproductive [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1719.8200000000002s)]
*  rights globally, but also in the United States. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1725.14s)]
*  She had toured a number of clinics down south about a year and a half ago, and she saw the [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1728.6200000000001s)]
*  maternal mortality crisis up close and personal. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1735.1000000000001s)]
*  In some southern states, and she said, Mom, there is so much need in our own country. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1739.66s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1746.5800000000002s)]
*  This is after Roe v. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1747.46s)]
*  Wade fell, obviously. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1748.5s)]
*  And what was it that moved you from that conversation? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1751.18s)]
*  What was it that made you think that you needed to pivot? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1755.1000000000001s)]
*  I started to learn more. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1758.5s)]
*  So one of the things I do whenever I feel like, OK, something is staring me in the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1759.5800000000002s)]
*  face, but do I know enough? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1764.14s)]
*  I felt like I needed to learn about what was going on in the space in the United States. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1766.38s)]
*  Was it policy? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1770.74s)]
*  Was it clinics themselves? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1772.1s)]
*  Was it funding? Who's doing funding? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1775.74s)]
*  And what I would say is I'm still learning in that space, but I always go out and talk [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1778.26s)]
*  to a set of experts. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1783.66s)]
*  I'll talk to other philanthropists and I will say I also have a council, a small council [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1784.66s)]
*  of other friends. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1789.6200000000001s)]
*  They will often say to me, oh, my son or daughter who's in their 30s thinks differently [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1791.42s)]
*  about that, Melinda. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1796.1s)]
*  And so I'll ask a whole lot more questions. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1796.98s)]
*  And then often they'll have their son or daughter send me a bunch of articles on something [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1799.26s)]
*  like this is why we think about it this way. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1803.7s)]
*  But the other thing I'll say is my daughter, Phoebe, led with another female gathering [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1806.82s)]
*  of people in New York, a philanthropist of her generation and put in front of them a [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1812.7s)]
*  number of reproductive rights organizations. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1818.34s)]
*  And they raised about 30 million dollars specifically for some of these organizations [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1820.82s)]
*  and organizations that said we've never actually had direct contact with philanthropists. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1825.74s)]
*  Right. But there's so much need right now. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1831.1399999999999s)]
*  And so I think it's really important to try and look at, OK, where are the holes, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1834.1399999999999s)]
*  where are the gaps, but also how do we go upstream of that and try and fix the system [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1839.82s)]
*  for people? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1844.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, we've talked a little bit about how to give. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1846.6200000000001s)]
*  Are you interested in directly funding, for example, paying for women to go across state [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1850.98s)]
*  lines to get abortions? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1856.42s)]
*  Or is it more about increasing access in rural communities to reproductive health? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1858.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, in a world after the fall of Roe, what does direct action look like? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1865.74s)]
*  Well, I think it's different again for different people. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1872.6999999999998s)]
*  I think for me, it will be more about access and more about policy. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1875.6599999999999s)]
*  How do we get the right policies in play? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1879.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's some of the work we have been able to do in the child care and the unpaid [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1882.98s)]
*  leave space. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1888.1799999999998s)]
*  And also, we've done a fair bit of research to prove what do Americans actually want and [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1889.4199999999998s)]
*  what are they saying on both sides of the aisle? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1894.8999999999999s)]
*  And then who are the players that are trying to push for the right kinds of policies? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1898.1s)]
*  We've done this also in the adolescent mental health space. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1904.06s)]
*  How do you make sure that adolescents actually can get mental health services and will [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1906.6999999999998s)]
*  insurance cover that and how do they have privacy in that? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1911.6999999999998s)]
*  So I also look at sort of the upstream, like I'm always looking at how can we affect the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1915.26s)]
*  most number of women's lives or even babies lives? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1919.82s)]
*  So you don't end up with these downstream effects. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1925.42s)]
*  You know, something you talked about in the first call was that shift of focus from abroad [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1929.42s)]
*  to home. And it's interesting that this particular issue came through your daughter. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  And I'm wondering if you wished you'd gotten involved sooner. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1938.5800000000002s)]
*  Was there a missed window of opportunity, do you think? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1943.94s)]
*  No, I think there was really a shift with the DAP's decision, a major shift. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1948.74s)]
*  And so when that happened, I really was like, oh, my gosh, there is work to do in the United [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1955.1399999999999s)]
*  States. I cannot believe we're at this place in this country. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1961.22s)]
*  To have a law on the books for 50 years, I cannot believe we would roll something like [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1966.26s)]
*  this back. What are we saying about women and women's decisions about their bodies? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1975.98s)]
*  Why would we put politics, why would we put government back in the middle of that? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1984.1000000000001s)]
*  Are you kidding? That decision had been made. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1989.38s)]
*  And my, you know, my young niece who's in her teens or my daughters who are in their [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1993.3s)]
*  20s, they just they've grown up with that law. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=1997.94s)]
*  Like, you know, you have a law in the books and you don't even you don't really consider [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2001.06s)]
*  it because a country that's moving forward, we would then roll back something. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2005.54s)]
*  I'm hearing you talk with such passion about this, and this was clearly such a pivotal [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2011.46s)]
*  moment for for the country, for women in the country. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2016.1000000000001s)]
*  And it's clearly been a catalyst to move you in this own in your own direction and to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2021.5s)]
*  take a stand by yourself. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2027.54s)]
*  This is going to I don't know how to ask this in a way that isn't going to be weird. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2031.58s)]
*  So just you can tell me that this is just a weird question. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2035.1000000000001s)]
*  But I'm thinking about how we've talked about women standing on their own two feet, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2037.86s)]
*  having their own autonomy, not having to stand next to somebody else. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2045.98s)]
*  And you've spoken in the past about how you sometimes felt unseen and unheard when you [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2051.18s)]
*  were with Bill. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2059.18s)]
*  And I'm curious about that sensation and then how that's changed now, because being part [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2060.8999999999996s)]
*  of a couple can also feel strengthening, but it can also take away from your own accomplishments. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2068.4199999999996s)]
*  We were equal partners at the foundation. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2078.4199999999996s)]
*  And so my name is on the building. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2081.3399999999997s)]
*  And when I walk into the room, the last I would say 18 years, I would say, I would say [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2083.8999999999996s)]
*  eight to 10 years, people know I'm standing for what I stand for and that it's me and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2089.98s)]
*  me speaking. And government leaders would call for both of us at times or even me or [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2094.1800000000003s)]
*  even him. So it wasn't so much that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2099.06s)]
*  But there is a process by which you make decisions when you stand next to someone who's [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2103.2200000000003s)]
*  equal. Right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2108.26s)]
*  And that isn't as easy when you're not still married. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2109.54s)]
*  But it also sometimes wasn't easy even when we were married. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2116.1400000000003s)]
*  And now, you know, I'm role modeling for society, which is I believe women should have [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2119.02s)]
*  their full decision making authority, their full authority over their resources, and they [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2125.5s)]
*  ought to make good policy. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2129.98s)]
*  And so for me, it came down to I'm just ready to do this. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2131.5400000000004s)]
*  I have 25 years of experience. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2135.1800000000003s)]
*  I know what I want to do and I don't want to have to negotiate with somebody else. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2137.82s)]
*  Like, will we go over here? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2142.38s)]
*  Will we change over there? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2143.86s)]
*  I was just ready to be on my own. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2145.98s)]
*  And I'm I'm turning 60. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2147.8199999999997s)]
*  So it's also kind of like, OK, if not now, when? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2149.5s)]
*  And I always learned from my mom, you know, set your own agenda. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2152.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just ready to set my own agenda as my own person. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIJi0qiocU&t=2154.9s)]
