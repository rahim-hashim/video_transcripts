# 'The Interview': Joel Embiid Believes He Could Have Been the GOAT
**New York Times - The Interview:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=6.4s)]
*  When the Olympics kick off in Paris next week, the Americans will be the overwhelming favorite [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=9.4s)]
*  for the men's basketball gold, like always. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=13.96s)]
*  And this year, central to that team is Philadelphia 76ers star Joël Embiid. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=16.96s)]
*  Embiid is one of basketball's best players, but he also seems weirdly cursed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=22.12s)]
*  I think of him almost as a kind of NBA Sisyphus, because for all his individual success, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=27.36s)]
*  that includes an MVP award and back-to-back scoring titles, he's never won a championship. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=32.56s)]
*  The Sixers have repeatedly fallen short in the playoffs, at times in almost comically [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=38.04s)]
*  heartbreaking fashion. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=42.14s)]
*  I'm talking literally due to a couple unlucky bounces here and there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=43.52s)]
*  And then there's the turnover. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=47.64s)]
*  The team has seen coaches, star players, and general managers come and then go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=48.64s)]
*  And Embiid himself keeps getting hurt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=53.88s)]
*  The combination of iffy management and bad luck have cast the shadow of unfulfilled potential [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=56.92s)]
*  over Embiid's decade-long career. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=61.96s)]
*  So in some ways, the Olympics are a chance for a bit of redemption. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=64.56s)]
*  But the path to Paris hasn't been smooth either, starting with the question of which country [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=67.8s)]
*  to play for. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=71.52s)]
*  Embiid is a citizen of the U.S., France, and Cameroon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=72.52s)]
*  And as he told me, for him, the decision of which jersey to put on wound up being both [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  personal and political. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=80.76s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Joël Embiid. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=83.2s)]
*  Can you talk to me a little bit about what it means for you to be playing for the United [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=86.92s)]
*  States? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=98.48s)]
*  It means a lot. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=99.48s)]
*  I mean, I spent half of my life here already. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=100.48s)]
*  You know, if you look at it, I'm going to spend more time here than I have in my home [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=103.08s)]
*  country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  I've got a great family, great wife, great people around, you know, my son. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  So it just made a lot of sense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=114.68s)]
*  And I just felt like having built a lot over here and having that opportunity to achieve [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=117.0s)]
*  the dream that I've had since growing up, I really appreciated that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Not to draw too many comparisons between you and me, because I don't think there are that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=130.68s)]
*  many comparisons between you and me, but I'm from Canada originally, and I have dual citizenship, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=133.88s)]
*  Canadian and U.S. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=138.88s)]
*  You know, and I have now been in the United States for 19 years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=139.88s)]
*  So soon I'll have lived in America for longer than I was in Canada, you know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=144.32s)]
*  And it's clear to me that for whatever reason, I will never self-identify as American, even [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=149.0s)]
*  though I have built my family here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=155.12s)]
*  My wife is American. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=157.16s)]
*  My kids are American. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=158.16s)]
*  Do you have similar feelings? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=159.92s)]
*  Like, when you think of Joël Embiid, do you think of yourself as American? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  No, I think I was myself as from Kenwood. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, I was always going to be home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=170.88s)]
*  I was born there, and what I've seen growing up, the struggle, I always identify with it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  because I think that's also one of the reasons why I ended up the way I am and I ended up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=180.48s)]
*  succeeding because of the environment I was raised in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=187.2s)]
*  Nothing was ever comfortable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  I always felt like, gotta work for everything. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's probably one of the reasons that kind of helped me. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I started playing basketball at 16. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=199.44s)]
*  It's hard to make it when you start that old, especially because guys have been playing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=202.88s)]
*  their whole life in America. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  So if I didn't kind of live through it growing up, I don't think I would have made it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=209.52s)]
*  A lot of people thought you were going to play for the French men's basketball team [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  at this year's Olympics. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  You ultimately decided to play for the American men's team. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=221.56s)]
*  Can you tell me how you wound up making that decision? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=224.88s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, I got my home country, Cameroon, which I love, and the U.S., where I've been [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  for I think it's 14 years now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=237.2s)]
*  And then obviously France, where I have a lot of family and I've been to France a lot [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  of times. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=246.04s)]
*  So it was tough. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=247.04s)]
*  But my goal growing up, I watched the Olympics. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=248.56s)]
*  It was always about, I want to play. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=252.48s)]
*  I want to be part of it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=255.04s)]
*  So that's been my dream. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=256.28s)]
*  So to me, that was what matters the most, achieving my dreams. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=257.56s)]
*  And one thing I said, I kind of fell in a rush in that decision because I wanted to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=263.4s)]
*  take as much time as possible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=269.52s)]
*  And it didn't help that France put an ultimatum on when the decision had to be made. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  They set a timeline. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=280.24s)]
*  So what was the timeline that they set? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=281.24s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  I saw it on Twitter and I was like, whoa, where did this come from? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=284.52s)]
*  Because from the conversation that I had with the U.S., it was, you know, just take as much [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=290.52s)]
*  time as you need. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=295.88s)]
*  There's no rush. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=296.88s)]
*  We'd love to have you, but it's okay if you make another decision. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=297.88s)]
*  And when you got someone else putting the pressure on you, making it seem like, oh, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=303.4s)]
*  you got to make the decision. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  But then again, one thing that was always known was that Cameroon is the first choice. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=310.84s)]
*  And if there's the qualifier, I'm playing for my home country because that's my dream [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  to play in the Olympics. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  And I had the opportunity to talk to the French president about what was going on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And I told him, I made it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  One thing that was kind of bothering me a lot was the relationship between France and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  Cameroon and African countries in general. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=339.16s)]
*  Yeah, historically. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=341.88s)]
*  And even right now, like, you know, like there's a lot of things going on over there where [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=342.88s)]
*  there's a lot of pushback as far as, you know, basically kicking out the French because it's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=348.08s)]
*  been so many years of oppression. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=352.88s)]
*  And so that was my mindset because I just knew it would be hard. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=355.12s)]
*  Like, I still got my family living in Cameroon and I don't want to put them through any of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=359.2s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=364.56s)]
*  I want them to be safe. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=365.56s)]
*  And you know, the relationship between France and Cameroon or Africa in general, it was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=367.56s)]
*  just not good. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=372.36s)]
*  You said you spoke to the president about this? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=374.36s)]
*  You mean Macron? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=376.4s)]
*  Yeah, Macron. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=377.4s)]
*  You know, no disrespect. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=378.4s)]
*  I would hope he has more important things to do than try to convince basketball players [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=379.4s)]
*  to come play for the French team. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=383.98s)]
*  But what did you say to him and what did he say back to you? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=385.72s)]
*  No, man, it was a nice conversation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=388.36s)]
*  I got a call and at first I usually don't answer random numbers and then I got a text [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=391.84s)]
*  and I figure what was happening. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=397.96s)]
*  It was a nice conversation. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  It was great. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, sort of a tangential question, but when you just mentioned that you started playing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  basketball at 16, I don't know how much you're aware of how crazy American parents are about [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=408.0s)]
*  sports and their kids. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=413.64s)]
*  But there really is a lot of pressure, I think, on kids to pick a sport very early, you know. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=414.64s)]
*  And there's the idea that if your kid hasn't identified his or her sport by the time they're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=419.76s)]
*  12 years old, they're never going to be a professional at that sport or make it to the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  next level. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=428.44s)]
*  So do you think the emphasis on starting kids super early in sports is misguided or is it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=429.44s)]
*  more likely that you're just, you know, sort of an athletic super talent and you were able [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=436.0s)]
*  to make it work? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=440.52s)]
*  I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=441.52s)]
*  Obviously, it's a little different for me because it worked. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=446.48s)]
*  So yeah, to answer your question, I mean, I got a son now. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  To me, first of all, I don't want to push him to play sports. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  He's going to do whatever he wants. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  If he start liking it, sure. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=459.04s)]
*  But if he doesn't and he's not interested in it, there's no point. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  He's going to do it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=465.72s)]
*  Your son is what, two? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=466.72s)]
*  Three. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=467.72s)]
*  Three. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=468.72s)]
*  So you have some time to worry about that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=469.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's in a Montessori school. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=470.72s)]
*  Like, you know, he's all about letting them, you know, make their own choices. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=471.72s)]
*  So he's going to figure that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=475.96s)]
*  But the thing that I know is that if he wanted to play sports, he doesn't necessarily have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=477.2s)]
*  to start playing basketball at that age or that young because growing up, that's what [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=483.4s)]
*  I did. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=488.8s)]
*  I played every sport. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=489.8s)]
*  So that probably prepared me for when I did start playing basketball at 16. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=490.8s)]
*  I wasn't ready, but I had the footwork and I had some of the fundamentals. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=496.98s)]
*  Are there ways in which having a son has changed how you think about your job? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=503.56s)]
*  Yeah, it changed everything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=510.32s)]
*  We had him in 2020. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=512.92s)]
*  And before that, I was not a serious human being. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=515.4s)]
*  I was always joking around. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=519.92s)]
*  I was always saying whatever. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=521.52s)]
*  I was always acting crazy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=523.44s)]
*  That was the golden days of my Twitter era. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=524.88s)]
*  Yeah, you famously were a very good Twitter troll, among other things. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=529.04s)]
*  And then once I found out that I was having a kid and then I was like, yeah, I got to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  set a better example. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  I can't just be on Twitter just trolling and that can't be my life. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  And yeah, that basically changed everything. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  The way I started thinking, you know, my focus on basketball changed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  Not that I wasn't taking it seriously before, but I even took it to another level. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  Explain to me why having a child made you take it to a next level. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=556.8s)]
*  Because I think, you know, for some people, the thought process might be like, hey, I [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=561.8s)]
*  have a kid now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  I realize like maybe basketball is not the most important thing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  It was all about setting a good example. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=571.88s)]
*  I think he came from my dad growing up. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=575.76s)]
*  He was a handball player and really good too. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  And he was also in the army. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=582.88s)]
*  You know, I was always going through all these games and just watching him competing and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=585.32s)]
*  succeeding, that was kind of like the bar for me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=592.28s)]
*  And I always told myself, I want to be better than him. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=595.88s)]
*  So if that was the bar, I was like, I got to achieve more. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=599.04s)]
*  And I don't want to put that pressure on my son. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=603.04s)]
*  But like, you know, if that's the way he wants to look at life, then if the bar is, you know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=606.28s)]
*  all these things, then he has to be the greatest player ever, which at least, you know, I think [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=613.24s)]
*  to me it's all about help. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  If I was healthy and all the seasons, that would be a different conversation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=621.64s)]
*  But is the implication that you think you would be in the greatest player of all time [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=626.12s)]
*  conversation without the injury problems? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=634.4s)]
*  I think I'm that talented. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=635.28s)]
*  I didn't stop believing it probably until I was in my fourth or fifth year in the league, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=638.08s)]
*  where I had the opportunity to accomplish something special. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=644.84s)]
*  And for that, obviously, you need to win championships. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=648.64s)]
*  And to win championships, you need other guys, you need help. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=651.76s)]
*  You can't do it by yourself. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=656.2s)]
*  It's just impossible. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=657.4s)]
*  So that's why I want to win so bad. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=658.6s)]
*  But then again, if you don't, you just got to understand as long as you worry about the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=662.48s)]
*  right stuff. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=668.32s)]
*  And if it doesn't happen, then I guess maybe it wasn't meant to happen. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=669.32s)]
*  So yeah, I kind of forgot the question. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=673.8800000000001s)]
*  So I got lost. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=677.32s)]
*  It was a question. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=678.32s)]
*  But you answered it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=679.32s)]
*  The question was about whether or not you feel like you were on a greatest of all time [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=680.96s)]
*  trajectory. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=684.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, the thing that has stopped me all these years is, you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=685.84s)]
*  know, just freak injuries. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=691.76s)]
*  Every single playoffs, regular season, people falling on my knee, or someone breaking my [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=693.16s)]
*  face twice. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=699.72s)]
*  It was always about freak injuries at the wrong time. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=700.72s)]
*  Like I really believe that because I would have been, if I was more healthy, I mean, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=704.28s)]
*  I think it would have been a different story. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=710.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=713.8s)]
*  What is the psychology of having to come back from injuries over and over again? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=715.04s)]
*  Because I think most of us can relate to wanting to achieve something and working hard toward [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=720.74s)]
*  achieving something. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=726.74s)]
*  And then through circumstances beyond our control, in your case, injuries, not being [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  able to achieve that thing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=733.1400000000001s)]
*  So how have you learned to not get discouraged? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=734.86s)]
*  Going back to where I was raised and where I came from, it's always about pushing, wanting [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=739.1s)]
*  to be better for yourself. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  There's only one injury that I've had that kind of put me, it was this past year where [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  mentally and physically, I just, that's the first one that like, it was tough. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=757.6999999999999s)]
*  But every other one was always about, okay, like it happens. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=764.18s)]
*  What am I supposed to do about it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=768.14s)]
*  It's life. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=769.9s)]
*  And then this past year was- [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=770.9s)]
*  Yeah, why was that different? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=772.9s)]
*  I don't know, just mentally, physically, because I was, you're playing your best basketball [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=775.26s)]
*  of your career and it's just becoming so easy every single night. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=783.58s)]
*  Like you're winning games and dropping 40, 50, 60, like you just- [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=788.1s)]
*  70, didn't you have a 70 point game? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=792.98s)]
*  Yeah, you finally got it figured out. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=794.66s)]
*  Like, you just become, you know what to do. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=796.74s)]
*  You have an answer for everything that's presented to you on the floor. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=800.58s)]
*  Double triplets and you just know where to go. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=804.22s)]
*  The system is in place and the guys, everybody's doing their job and then you're on your way [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=807.22s)]
*  to accomplish a lot of good things and then just like that, something happens. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=813.5s)]
*  Someone falls on your knee again. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=819.46s)]
*  For this one, I don't know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=822.26s)]
*  I don't have any explanation to why it was so tough, but it just was mentally depressing [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=823.86s)]
*  physically, your body not responding the way it should. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  So how did you deal with that when you were depressed and your body wasn't responding? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=838.02s)]
*  Same mindset, get back to it, walk as hard as possible, not let anybody see any weaknesses [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=843.62s)]
*  and act like everything is great and hopefully you snap out of it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=850.98s)]
*  You know, you've been there in Philly about 10 years. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=855.86s)]
*  I might get the numbers a little wrong, but you know, I think you had three coaches in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=859.4599999999999s)]
*  that time. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=862.66s)]
*  There's been front office turnover, you know, other superstar players have come and gone, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=863.66s)]
*  James Harden, Jimmy Butler. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=868.26s)]
*  Do you find yourself ever having questions about in the long term whether Philly is the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=870.6999999999999s)]
*  place where you can win a championship? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=878.14s)]
*  Because there has been that sort of tumultuousness with the franchise since you've been there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=881.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure everybody asks themselves questions if you care about the right things and you [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=885.5s)]
*  care about winning and it hasn't happened, which I'm probably at fault too. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=890.3s)]
*  Why would you be at fault? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=895.9799999999999s)]
*  Because I'm in injuries, I don't perform at the level that I should. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=897.78s)]
*  So that's why I'm at fault. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=902.6999999999999s)]
*  But then again, if you want to win, the thing that I always talked about is stability, continuity. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  Probably having three coaches based on what I've seen is not too bad. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=913.26s)]
*  But no, still three coaches, three different systems. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=919.1s)]
*  And even within those coaches, every single year is something different. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=923.5s)]
*  And then the players, every single year is like new co-star, new players. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=929.06s)]
*  And when you start looking at teams that are born, whether it's Golden State, Boston this [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=936.26s)]
*  Denver last year, those guys have been together for a long time and then they just added a [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=941.74s)]
*  few other pieces that were able to take them over the top. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=945.98s)]
*  So you start thinking about, I mean, you go through the years, the Jimmy year, we had [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=950.26s)]
*  pretty good team and then we ended up losing on a game, winning buzzer beta against the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=956.66s)]
*  eventual champions. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=963.02s)]
*  Famously Kawhi Leonard, game seven, the ball bounced around the rim and went through and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=964.02s)]
*  you guys lost. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=968.86s)]
*  And the way I look at it is like, you got so close and instead of like, what can we [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=970.1s)]
*  do to make the team better, but also having the same core, change the whole team. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  No continuity. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=982.7s)]
*  No continuity. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=983.7s)]
*  You mentioned that game seven against Toronto, I think it was 2019. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=985.08s)]
*  After that game on the court, you were crying. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=989.94s)]
*  And I think for some people who are watching, that was an endearing moment. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=993.1800000000001s)]
*  It showed how much you cared. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=996.58s)]
*  And you know, probably for some other people, maybe they thought, you know, we don't want [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  to see athletes crying on the court. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1002.16s)]
*  For the whole Twitter war, that was a fun moment for them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  They enjoyed that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1008.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1009.0s)]
*  What were they saying on Twitter? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1010.0s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1011.0s)]
*  I'm just, yeah, because I said, you know what they are saying. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1012.0s)]
*  Don't say you don't know. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1013.4799999999999s)]
*  Today's day I still see the video and the me, you know, they make fun of it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1014.4799999999999s)]
*  I just look at it, you know, for some people that just saw it as a way to kind of make [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1019.9599999999999s)]
*  fun of you. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1025.72s)]
*  But I just care. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1026.72s)]
*  Like you just see, you know, it hurts, you know, losing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1028.32s)]
*  But my question was whether or not that moment or that game was sort of a turning point for [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1031.68s)]
*  your demeanor on the court. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1039.04s)]
*  Because I think leading up to that, you know, you sort of had a more playful attitude on [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1041.0s)]
*  the court, you know, it sort of embraced the showmanship aspect a little bit more. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1046.04s)]
*  And then after it seemed like you were sort of more just more serious on the court. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1050.08s)]
*  2020 was probably my worst year in the NBA. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1054.4s)]
*  I just wasn't having fun because going back to continuity, like we got rid of Jimmy, JJ, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1058.72s)]
*  and basically started over. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1068.72s)]
*  I'm just like, why? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1070.28s)]
*  Like that just doesn't make sense. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1071.28s)]
*  And then the following year, we're just struggling. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1073.0800000000002s)]
*  We're not as good as we should be. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1075.16s)]
*  And the whole year, I'm just like, I don't want to play basketball. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  I played that whole year, I'm like, I didn't care. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1081.96s)]
*  It was just depressing. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1085.16s)]
*  Like I just wasn't there. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1086.16s)]
*  But it did change, you know, because before that I used to interact with the fans and, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1088.28s)]
*  you know, always be, you know, laughing. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1093.16s)]
*  And from then, I just became more serious. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1095.64s)]
*  And I think a lot of people in Philadelphia, they think I don't care and I don't, you know, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1099.16s)]
*  care about basketball or because I'm not doing what they used to. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1105.52s)]
*  You know, I'm not having fun now. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1110.2s)]
*  I'm still having fun. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1111.8799999999999s)]
*  But I'm just so focused. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1114.0s)]
*  I don't have the energy to just be interacting with it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1116.2s)]
*  I'm just trying to do the job. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1119.52s)]
*  I'm just different. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1121.56s)]
*  I'm more serious. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1122.56s)]
*  I'm more mature and I don't need to be doing that all the time. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1123.56s)]
*  So yeah, there's a lot to think about. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1128.56s)]
*  But you know, I love Philly. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1131.08s)]
*  I've been here, you know, for 10 years. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1133.24s)]
*  It's looking like I'm going to be here for a long time and actually have an opportunity [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1136.44s)]
*  to finish my career here if they let me, if they want to. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1142.76s)]
*  What's the best cheesesteak in the city? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1148.16s)]
*  I don't eat cheesesteaks. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1149.76s)]
*  You don't eat cheesesteaks? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1150.76s)]
*  You want to know the real answer? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1153.64s)]
*  This is the news item from this interview. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1155.3200000000002s)]
*  The best cheesesteak is Subway cheesesteak. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1156.92s)]
*  Subway cheesesteak? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  Everybody in Philadelphia who is dead is rolling over in their grave. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1161.84s)]
*  Tony loops, hats, genos. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't eat cheesesteaks. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1169.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm not even from Philadelphia. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm shocked that you think the best cheesesteak is from Subway. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  It's an abomination. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1174.9599999999998s)]
*  And so your dad was a colonel in the military and I assume pretty strict. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  And my understanding too is that you have a fairly disciplined personal life. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1185.8s)]
*  You don't drink and do other stuff. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  Is it ever hard to fit into the culture of the league when you're playing with a guy [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  like James Harden who's a famous partier and you have the lifestyle that you have? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1199.6799999999998s)]
*  Is there ever temptation? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1204.4399999999998s)]
*  No, there's never any temptation. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1205.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't drink, I don't smoke, never in my life. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  So you might be over-indicated, but I've never been like, I want to try it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1213.0s)]
*  To me, that's actually disgusting. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1218.56s)]
*  I hate the smell. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1221.24s)]
*  I just can't stand it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1223.2s)]
*  And it's probably because of the way I was raised. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1224.8s)]
*  But then again, to me, the way I look at life, it always goes both ways because it was a [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1229.8s)]
*  strict environment where I was raised. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  But then again, some people also tend to go the other way. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  Because it was so strict and they decided to be wild because they weren't given that [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1244.24s)]
*  opportunity growing up. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1249.32s)]
*  And just sort of in terms of how you grew up and how you developed as a person, this [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1251.96s)]
*  is sort of a more serious approach at this topic than what we were just talking about. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1258.56s)]
*  But you lost your younger brother when he was 13, maybe you were 20 or so. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1263.6s)]
*  How did that experience affect your thinking about life and what you want from life moving [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1269.16s)]
*  forward? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1276.0s)]
*  It changed a lot. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1278.88s)]
*  I mean, losing someone that young and someone that's so close to you that young, especially [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1281.0s)]
*  because I wasn't around. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1288.0s)]
*  I hadn't gone back to Cameroon since I got to the States, so I hadn't really seen him [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  in a long time. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1297.2s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it was tough just going through it from my family, my parents, my mom to this [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1298.88s)]
*  day, all of us to this day, but especially for my mom. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1306.8400000000001s)]
*  It still seemed pretty recent and pretty tough. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1310.48s)]
*  But did it change your priorities? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, family is really important. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1316.2s)]
*  So yeah, it made me not want to have three kids, maybe want to have four because there [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1319.8000000000002s)]
*  was three of us and I don't like that number three. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1327.92s)]
*  I was actually drafted number three, but I don't like number three because there was [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1330.5200000000002s)]
*  only two of us left. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1334.0400000000002s)]
*  So I told my wife, I'm like, you better have four kids at least because with that two is [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1336.92s)]
*  too little and three is not. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1343.64s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  And then just in life, just cherishing and just including family more in everything that's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  being done. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1355.2s)]
*  It's also one of those things where it exposes the great lie of sports where I think we all [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1356.8400000000001s)]
*  operate under this idea that it's life and death and it's not. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1363.04s)]
*  It's not. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1368.16s)]
*  I mean, that's why I always tell people, even when it comes to winning, my body always asks [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1369.16s)]
*  me, how would you feel if you won a championship? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1375.16s)]
*  I'm like, if it happens, it'd be great. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1378.56s)]
*  I feel great. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1381.76s)]
*  I'm going to enjoy to the fullest and you never going to hear the end of it. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1383.28s)]
*  But then again, if it just doesn't happen, what do you want me to do after I retire? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1388.48s)]
*  Cry about it? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1393.0s)]
*  No, just move on. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1394.0s)]
*  Live life because life is bigger than basketball. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1395.0s)]
*  After the break, more from Embiid on the Olympics and why he thinks the gold medal for Team USA [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1406.48s)]
*  is far from guaranteed. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1411.76s)]
*  The talent that's on the USA, you also got to understand, like most of those guys are [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1414.0s)]
*  also older. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1419.52s)]
*  Like Lebron now is not. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1420.52s)]
*  Lebron was a couple of years ago. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1423.04s)]
*  Hi, Joel. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1440.5600000000002s)]
*  How are you? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  Good. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1443.6399999999999s)]
*  Good. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1444.6399999999999s)]
*  Where are you right now? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1445.6399999999999s)]
*  It's sort of a little echoey. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  Are you in like your home office or something or where you speak from? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1447.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the office. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1450.28s)]
*  Just in talking to you, you know, you're so obviously a thoughtful guy and unassuming [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1453.12s)]
*  and you have a gentle demeanor about you. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1457.56s)]
*  But then on the court sometimes, there's sort of a rough quality to you. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1460.72s)]
*  Drawing fouls and you know, I know you're not going to want to hear me say this, but [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1465.3999999999999s)]
*  there's some flopping that happens or maybe taking some highly questionable fouls. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1468.8s)]
*  And it makes me wonder about whether or not you feel like you have to become a different [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1473.72s)]
*  person when you're on the court from who you are normally. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1477.72s)]
*  No, I think it's still the same because everything that I do in life, I compete. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1482.0s)]
*  Like I just, I'm just a competitor, so I want to win in everything that I do. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1490.12s)]
*  Do you let your kid beat you at stuff? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  We do play basketball sometimes and he hates when I block him. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1498.92s)]
*  You block a three year old? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1502.64s)]
*  Got to learn while they're so young, so yeah, got to learn. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  And you know, you had talked about feeling more depressed this past season about being [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1509.72s)]
*  injured and how it was more of a mental challenge than it had been previously. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1518.16s)]
*  And given your background, growing up in a military family, a strict family, as well [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  as the pressures that I think that athletes in particular have to not show vulnerability [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1529.36s)]
*  or to admit weakness, did that make it hard for you to come to the realization that you [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1535.1599999999999s)]
*  were depressed? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1540.3999999999999s)]
*  I still don't know what depression is, but to this day, like, yeah, I imagine, yeah, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1541.6s)]
*  I felt like I was depressed, but I'll never tell you that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1546.32s)]
*  Like I was actually going through depression. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1549.28s)]
*  I don't know what that feels like, but maybe based on some of the symptoms and the way [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1552.44s)]
*  I was feeling, that might make a little sense. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  I always saw, I believe in, how can I say this? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1561.48s)]
*  I believe in mental health, but I've never been one to admit that I might be going through [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1569.32s)]
*  something like that. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1578.24s)]
*  Like you say, the background, where I'm from, so it's kind of hard to admit that something [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  is going on and that you're open about it. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1587.84s)]
*  Do you feel like you can admit it now? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1591.6799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1594.28s)]
*  And you played with JJ Reddick, of course. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1597.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think about him taking the Lakers coaching job with no prior coaching experience? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1601.0s)]
*  You know, with those types of jobs, it's tough, like you, especially as a first time [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1605.3200000000002s)]
*  head coach, like if I was in, I don't know if that's a perfect situation and maybe he [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1610.2s)]
*  thinks that's a perfect situation, but I always feel like as a first time head coach, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1618.5600000000002s)]
*  it's like kind of like a make or break situation for you, because if you succeed, great, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  you're going to be coached for years and years. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1629.48s)]
*  But if you're mishandled, then you don't succeed. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1633.16s)]
*  Those coaches are usually bound to be fired within a year or two if you don't accomplish [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1636.72s)]
*  anything. You could find yourself in a situation where it's like, you didn't do a good job, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1641.72s)]
*  you know, in that situation, why should we hire him? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1647.8000000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, I love him, I'm happy for him. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1650.68s)]
*  You know, he's always wanted to be a coach, but that's a tough job. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1653.52s)]
*  Just to go back to the Olympics, other countries are better than ever at basketball. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1659.5600000000002s)]
*  They have more NBA players on their teams than they did in the past. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you have any doubt about who's going to win the gold medal? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you look at the time that the US has, but I mean, there's also like equal time on [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1672.44s)]
*  other teams and the talent that's on the US team. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1678.92s)]
*  You also got to understand, like most of those guys are also older. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1683.0800000000002s)]
*  Like LeBron now is not the LeBron that was a couple of years ago. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1687.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's a big difference. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1692.1999999999998s)]
*  So the name might be there, but everybody was also, but also tell you and you can see for [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1693.4799999999998s)]
*  yourself, like the athletic LeBron and the dominant that he was a couple of years ago [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1699.1599999999999s)]
*  is not the same that he is now. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1705.08s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, I think people get fooled by the names on their own paper. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1707.12s)]
*  But yeah, those names have been built throughout their career and now they're older. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1714.72s)]
*  So they're not what they used to be. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1720.04s)]
*  You know, I just teed you up to say the US is going to kick everyone's ass. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1723.36s)]
*  Instead, you gave an even handed nuanced answer. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's the goal. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1730.1599999999999s)]
*  And you also got to understand, like a lot of us haven't played with each other. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1732.8s)]
*  So that's going to be a brand new start. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1737.1599999999999s)]
*  And you got to learn each other and, you know, find the best way to play together. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1740.0800000000002s)]
*  Before we go, I just wanted to say that you know that the like the sports media hot [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1747.0800000000002s)]
*  take machine is going to go into overdrive because you said that, you know, if it hadn't [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
*  been for injuries, you'd be in the greatest of all time conversation. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1756.3600000000001s)]
*  That's that's OK, because that's the truth. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1759.2s)]
*  You think about what I've been able to accomplish and what has been taken away. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1763.0s)]
*  Because of injuries like. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1769.92s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of what ifs, but then again, you can make the case of being up there. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1772.68s)]
*  You know, you also in the context of your younger brother talked about your understanding [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1779.76s)]
*  that life is bigger than basketball. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1785.76s)]
*  At the end of the day, the wins and losses are like they're actually not the most [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1788.2s)]
*  important thing. Do you think there's any way in which understanding that inhibits [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1791.72s)]
*  your own fire or will to win? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1798.32s)]
*  Like if you actually know that winning is not the most important thing, does that in [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1800.76s)]
*  any way hold you back? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1806.0s)]
*  No, because if you hold me back, I would have never been through injuries. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I live in the present and the present means any chance I don't get go after it as [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1813.24s)]
*  far as winning. But then also understanding that when I'm done, I should not have any [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1820.56s)]
*  regrets. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1827.92s)]
*  Joel, thank you for taking all the time to talk with me and good luck at the Olympics. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM&t=1830.04s)]
