# Curtis Yarvin on the End of American Democracy
**New York Times - The Interview:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8)
*  For years, Curtis Yarvin had been writing online about political theory and relative obscurity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=0.0s)]
*  His ideas were pretty extreme, that institutions at the heart of American intellectual life, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=5.68s)]
*  like the mainstream media and academia, need to be dissolved. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=10.24s)]
*  He also believes that government bureaucracy should be radically gutted, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=13.44s)]
*  and that American democracy should be replaced by what he calls a monarchy run by a CEO. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=16.72s)]
*  Monarch is good, it's a neutral term. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=22.56s)]
*  But while Yarvin himself may still be obscure, his ideas are not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Vice President-elect JD Vance has alluded to his notions of forcibly ridding American [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=28.08s)]
*  institutions of so-called wokeism. And Yarvin has also found fans in the most powerful and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=33.04s)]
*  increasingly political ranks of Silicon Valley. Like Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=38.4s)]
*  turned informal advisor to President-elect Trump. We are living under FDR's personal monarchy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=43.44s)]
*  Peter Thiel, a Republican megadoner, has called him a powerful historian. On top of it all, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=48.8s)]
*  Yarvin has become a fixture of the right-wing podcast universe. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=55.28s)]
*  He's been a guest on the shows of Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk, among others. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for that lovely intro, Tucker. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=62.56s)]
*  I've been aware of Yarvin for years, but always thought of his work as pretty fringe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=64.8s)]
*  A lot of what Yarvin has to say is disturbing, and the historical evidence he justifies it with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=68.72s)]
*  is riddled with exaggeration, distortion, and sometimes just plain inaccuracy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=73.44s)]
*  But given that his ideas are now finding an audience with some of the most powerful people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=77.92s)]
*  in the country, Yarvin can't be so easily dismissed anymore. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=81.68s)]
*  When you say to a New York Times reader, democracy is bad, they're a little bit shocked. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=85.04s)]
*  But when you say to them, politics is bad, or even populism is bad, they're like, of course, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=91.2s)]
*  these are horrible things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm David Marchese, and here's my conversation with writer Curtis Yarvin. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  To my understanding, one of your central arguments is that America needs to, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=102.0s)]
*  I think the way you've put it in the past, is sort of get over our dictator phobia, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=119.68s)]
*  that American democracy is a sham, beyond fixing, and having sort of a monarch-style leader, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=124.64s)]
*  or call it a CEO, or call it a dictator, that's the way to go. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=135.04s)]
*  So why is democracy so bad, and why would having a dictator solve the problem? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=139.6s)]
*  Let me answer that in, I think, a way that will be relatively accessible to readers of the New [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=148.8s)]
*  York Times. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=153.28s)]
*  You've probably heard of a man named Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=154.24s)]
*  I do a speech sometimes where I'll just read the last 10 paragraphs of FDR's first inaugural [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=160.88s)]
*  address, in which FDR essentially says to the American people, hey, Congress, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=171.04s)]
*  give me absolute power, or I'll take it anyway. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=176.24s)]
*  So did FDR actually take that level of power? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=179.44s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=184.32s)]
*  So there's a great piece that I've sent to some of the people that I know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  that are involved in the transition. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=191.28s)]
*  And who? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=193.6s)]
*  Which is, I mean, there's all sorts of people milling around. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=194.32s)]
*  Name one. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=198.88s)]
*  Name one, wow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=199.92s)]
*  Name one, well, I definitely know Mark Andreessen, and so I sent this piece to Mark Andreessen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=202.0s)]
*  And it's an excerpt from the diary of Harold Ickes, who is FDR's secretary of the interior. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=208.88s)]
*  And it's a little diary entry describing a cabinet meeting in 1933. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  And what happens in this cabinet meeting is that Francis Perkins, who's the secretary of labor, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=224.48s)]
*  comes in to this meeting and is like, here, I have a list of the projects that we're going to do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=232.96s)]
*  FDR personally takes this list, looks at the projects in New York, and is like, this is crap. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=239.12s)]
*  This is crap. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  What aren't you doing? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=246.24s)]
*  Like, humiliates Francis Perkins in the Oval Office or wherever they're having their cabinet [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=246.88s)]
*  meeting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  And then at the end of the thing, it's like everybody agrees that the bill would be fixed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  and then passed through Congress. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=257.04s)]
*  This is just a picture of FDR acting like a CEO. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=258.48s)]
*  And so the question of was FDR a dictator? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=262.24s)]
*  What does it mean to be a dictator? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=265.92s)]
*  What does this pejorative word mean? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=267.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  What I know is that Americans of all stripes, Democrats, Republicans, and everyone, except [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=270.48s)]
*  for a few right-wing Republicans, basically revere FDR. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=275.68s)]
*  And FDR ran the New Deal like a startup. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=280.32s)]
*  So as I understand it, the point you're trying to make is that we have had something [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=284.0s)]
*  like a dictator in the past in American history, and therefore it's not something to be afraid [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  of now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=298.08s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=298.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  What we see in the course of to kind of look at the objective reality of power in the US [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=299.84s)]
*  since the revolution, you'll talk to people about the Articles of Confederation, and you're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=310.96s)]
*  just like, name one thing that happened in America under the Articles of Confederation, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=314.88s)]
*  and they can't unless they're a professional historian. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=319.68s)]
*  Next, you have the first constitutional period with under George Washington. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=322.64s)]
*  If you look at the administration of Washington, what you'll see is that basically what is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=329.2s)]
*  established looks a lot like a startup. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=334.32s)]
*  It looks so much like a startup that this guy Alexander Hamilton, who is recognizably [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=337.76s)]
*  a startup bro, is running the whole government. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=342.24s)]
*  He's basically the Larry Page of this republic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=346.16s)]
*  He's nominally the secretary. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=350.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm asking you, what did you have for breakfast? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=351.6s)]
*  And you're saying, well, you know, at the dawn of man, when cereals were first cultivated. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=355.12s)]
*  I'm doing a Putin. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  I'll speed this up. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=361.36s)]
*  And then answer the question, what's so bad about democracy? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=364.48s)]
*  To make a long story short, whether you want to call Washington, Lincoln, and FDR dictators, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=364.88s)]
*  this sort of, you know, appropriate word, what they were was basically national CEOs. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=370.56s)]
*  And they were running the government like a company from the top down. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=376.48s)]
*  So why is democracy so bad? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=381.44s)]
*  So it's not even that democracy is bad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=383.36s)]
*  It's just that it's very weak. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=386.08s)]
*  And the fact that it's very weak is basically easily seen by the fact that very unpopular [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=388.32s)]
*  policies like mass immigration persist despite strong majorities being against them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=396.32s)]
*  So the question of basically, is democracy good or bad, is I think a secondary question to, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=403.2s)]
*  is it what we actually have? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=411.2s)]
*  When you say to a New York Times reader, democracy is bad, they're a little bit shocked. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=413.6s)]
*  But when you say to them, politics is bad, or even populism is bad, they're like, of course, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=419.76s)]
*  these are horrible things. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=425.6s)]
*  And so the thing is, when you basically want to be anti, you know, say democracy is not [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=426.8s)]
*  a good system of government, just bridge that immediately to saying populism is not a good [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  system of government. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  And then you'll be like, yes, of course, like, actually, you know, policy and, you know, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=439.12s)]
*  and law should be set by wise experts and people in the courts and lawyers and professors and so [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=444.56s)]
*  forth. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=451.36s)]
*  Then you'll realize that what you're actually endorsing is aristocracy rather than democracy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, your ideas are ones that have been pointed to by people in real positions of power [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=457.92s)]
*  in the Republican Party. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=467.68s)]
*  I think it's probably overstated the extent to which you and JD Vance are friends, but he has [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=469.68s)]
*  Definitely overstated. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=474.24s)]
*  He has mentioned you by name, publicly and, you know, referred to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  de-wokefication ideas that sort of are very similar to yours. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=482.96s)]
*  You know, you've been on Michael Anton's podcast, and Michael Anton has been tapped by Trump to be [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=487.92s)]
*  high up in the State Department, talking with him about how to install an American Caesar. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=494.08s)]
*  Peter Thiel, a major Republican donor, has said, you know, you're an interesting thinker. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=500.0s)]
*  And so let's say people in actual positions of power said to you, Curtis, we're going to do the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=506.8s)]
*  Curtis Yardman thing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=512.88s)]
*  What are the steps that they would take to change American democracy into something like a monarchy? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=514.4s)]
*  My honest answer would have to be it's not exactly time for that yet. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  Because what I look, what I see happening in D.C. right now, you know, nobody should be watching [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=530.0s)]
*  this panicking, you know, thinking I'm about to be installed as America's secret dictator. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=535.12s)]
*  And I don't think I'm even going to the inauguration. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  Were you invited? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=545.28s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=546.48s)]
*  I'm an outsider, man. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm an intellectual. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=551.12s)]
*  And the actual ways in which my ideas get into circulation is actually mostly through the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  staffers and the kind of younger people who basically kind of, you know, swim in this very [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=558.0s)]
*  online kind of soup. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=563.68s)]
*  And I think that's fine. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=566.48s)]
*  I think that what's happening now in D.C. to sort of distinguish my much more radical ideas from [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  what's happening now, I would say that what's happening now is there's definitely an [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=573.92s)]
*  attempt to revive the White House as an executive organization, which sort of governs the executive [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=579.76s)]
*  branch. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=589.68s)]
*  And the difficulty with that is if you go to Washington and say to anyone who's professionally [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  involved in the business of Washington that Washington would work just fine or even better [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=596.24s)]
*  if there was no White House at all. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=601.84s)]
*  And they'll basically be like, yeah, of course, the executive branch works for Congress. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=603.92s)]
*  So you have these poor voters out there who elected as they think a revolution. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=608.32s)]
*  They elected Donald Trump and, you know, maybe the world's most capable CEO. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=612.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  And your point is he can't the way the system set up, he can't actually get that much. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=617.44s)]
*  He can't actually do that much to it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  And he can block things. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=623.44s)]
*  He can disrupt it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=624.6400000000001s)]
*  He can create chaos and turbulence or whatever, but he can't really change what it is. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=625.7600000000001s)]
*  Do you think you're maybe overstating the inefficacy of a president? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=632.0s)]
*  You could point to, you know, the repeal of Roe is something that's directly [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=639.04s)]
*  attributable to Donald Trump being president. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=644.56s)]
*  You could point, one could argue that the COVID response was attributable to Donald Trump. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=646.8s)]
*  And I think the COVID response is a slightly better example. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=654.16s)]
*  Certainly many things about COVID were different because Donald Trump was president. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=659.04s)]
*  Here, I'll tell you a funny story. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=664.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  At the risk of bringing my children into the media, you know, in 2016, my son, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=666.64s)]
*  Who's how old? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=674.4s)]
*  He's now 14. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=675.5999999999999s)]
*  He was six then. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=676.56s)]
*  And my children were going to a Shishi progressive manor and immersion school in San Francisco. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=678.16s)]
*  You sent your kids to a Shishi. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=685.36s)]
*  Sorry, I'm laughing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  You sent your kids to a Shishi progressive school. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=687.92s)]
*  At that time, manor and immersion. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=689.92s)]
*  The rubber hits the road and that's what happens. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=693.76s)]
*  And you can't isolate children from the world, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=694.4s)]
*  And so at the time, my late wife and I did not, we just adopted the simple expedient of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  not talking about politics in front of the children, which I recommend everyone. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=704.16s)]
*  But of course, everyone's talking better at school, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=710.4s)]
*  My son comes home and he has this very concrete question. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=713.6s)]
*  He's like, pop, when Donald Trump builds a wall around the country, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=718.08s)]
*  how are we going to be able to go to the beach? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=721.7600000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, you really took him literally. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=724.32s)]
*  Like everybody else is taking him literally, but you really took him literally. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=726.72s)]
*  And I was like, you know, if you see anything in the real world around you [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=730.6400000000001s)]
*  over the next four years that changes as a result of this election, I'll be surprised. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=735.12s)]
*  In one of your recent blog posts, I guess it's a newsletter, not a blog at this point, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=741.84s)]
*  you referred to JD Vance as I think as a normie. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=746.08s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=752.24s)]
*  I would say that the thing that I admire about Vance and the thing that's really remarkable [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=753.44s)]
*  about him as a leader is that I think that he contains within him all kinds of Americans. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=760.08s)]
*  His ability to connect with like flyover Americans in the world that he came from [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=767.84s)]
*  is of course very, very great. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=774.08s)]
*  But the other thing that's neat about him is that he went to Yale and Yale Law School, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=776.08s)]
*  in fact, and so he can connect at a, he speaks, he's a fluent speaker of the language of the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=780.88s)]
*  New York Times, which you cannot say about Donald Trump. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=787.2s)]
*  And one of the things that I believe really strongly, you know, that I haven't touched on [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=790.4s)]
*  when I talk about monarchy is I think that it's utterly essential for anything like an [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=794.72s)]
*  American monarchy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=802.08s)]
*  You have to be the president of all Americans. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=803.2s)]
*  And I think this is something that basically the new administration could do a much better job [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=805.6s)]
*  of reaching out to progressive Americans and not demonizing them and basically saying, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=811.84s)]
*  hey, you want to make this country a better place? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  I feel like you've been misinformed in some ways. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=820.88s)]
*  You're not a bad person. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=823.68s)]
*  This is like 10 to 20% of Americans. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=824.88s)]
*  This is a lot of people are like the NPR class, but they are not bad people, evil people who [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=827.12s)]
*  want to like do, you know, like, but the thing is they're human beings. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=831.76s)]
*  We're all human beings and like human beings can support bad regimes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=836.88s)]
*  The question was why, why did you call JD Vance a normie? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  Because he contains within him norminess, but he's also an intellectual and he contains within [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=844.0s)]
*  him intellectual. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, what you just said about, you know, the administration could do a better job of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=850.0s)]
*  reaching out to progressives. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=856.4s)]
*  We're all human beings. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=858.88s)]
*  As you well know, it's a pretty different stance than the stance you often take in your [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=861.12s)]
*  writing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=866.96s)]
*  Right, you're laughing because you know it's true. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=870.0s)]
*  Where, you know, you talk about things like de-wokefication, how people who work at places [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=871.84s)]
*  like the New York Times should all lose our jobs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  We should, you know, you have an idea for a program called Rage, retire all government [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=882.48s)]
*  employees, you know, you have ideas which I hope are satirical about, you know, how to handle [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  non-productive members of society that involve basically locking them in a room forever. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  So why is your tone, has your thinking shifted? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=897.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=900.0s)]
*  Is a rhetorical tone different in a setting like this? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=900.56s)]
*  You're looking for different, my thinking is definitely not shifted and you're finding [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=904.0s)]
*  different emphases. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=907.68s)]
*  Let me, it's like when I talk about Rage, for example, you know, both my parents worked for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=908.64s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=912.88s)]
*  They were career, you know, federal employees. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=913.5999999999999s)]
*  It's a little on the nose from a Freudian perspective. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=915.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=918.2399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, go on. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=918.4799999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=919.3599999999999s)]
*  But the thing is basically when you look at the way, when you look at those, the way to [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  treat those institutions, I'm just like, treat it like a company that goes out of business, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=925.68s)]
*  but sort of more so because these people having had power have to actually be treated even more [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  delicately and with even more respect. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=938.0s)]
*  And winning means these are your people now. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  And so the thing is when you understand the perspective of the new regime with respect [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  to the American aristocracy, their perspective has, can't be this sort of [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=950.24s)]
*  anti aristocratic thing of like, we're going to like bayonet all the professors and like, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=955.12s)]
*  you know, throw them in ditches or whatever. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=960.24s)]
*  Their perspective has to be that like you were a normal person serving a regime that [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=962.72s)]
*  did this like really weird and crazy stuff. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=968.24s)]
*  How invested do you think JD Vance is in democracy? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=971.36s)]
*  It depends what you mean by democracy. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=974.8s)]
*  I mean, I think that the problem is basically when people equate democracy with good [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=976.4s)]
*  government, when you use that word, you're using a very tricky word. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=981.52s)]
*  I would say that what someone like, I'm on very safe ground despite not knowing him well at all, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=986.56s)]
*  that someone like JD Vance believes essentially in the common good and the idea that government [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=994.0s)]
*  should serve the common good. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1001.92s)]
*  And I think that people like JD and people in the sort of the broader intellectual scene [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1004.48s)]
*  around him, which is very varied intellectual scene, you know, would all agree on that principle. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1009.84s)]
*  Now, if that principle, I don't know what you mean by democracy in this context. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1017.6s)]
*  What I do know is that if democracy is against the common good, it's bad. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1023.12s)]
*  And if it's for the common good, it's good. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  I think what you just described might be something that Peter Thiel would agree with. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1030.48s)]
*  And there was... [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1037.76s)]
*  I think a progressive could agree with it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1039.28s)]
*  And there was a reporting that I saw, I think it was 2017, reporting done by BuzzFeed where they [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  published some emails, I think, between you and the right-wing provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1048.8s)]
*  where you talked about watching the 2016 election with Peter Thiel and referred to him [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1055.52s)]
*  as a fully enlightened. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1063.76s)]
*  What would fully enlightened have meant in that context? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1066.8s)]
*  What fully enlightened for me generally means fully disenchanted. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1071.36s)]
*  When I look at basically what the kinds of people that I know not really that well in [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1075.4399999999998s)]
*  Silicon Valley think, I'm basically like, you know, have people like this been exposed to my ideas? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  Do they agree that America should be a monarchy? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1091.04s)]
*  I doubt it, but I have no idea. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1095.12s)]
*  But what they agree on is not a belief, but a disbelief. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1097.76s)]
*  So I think that when a person who lives their life within the kind of, you know, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1103.12s)]
*  sort of progressive bubble, liberal bubble, use whatever term you like, of, you know, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1108.08s)]
*  the current year, looks at the right or even the new right or whatever, you know, you want to call it, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1114.32s)]
*  I think what's hardest to see is that what's really shared is not a positive belief, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1122.8s)]
*  but an absence of belief. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1129.9199999999998s)]
*  Basically, we don't worship these same gods. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1131.76s)]
*  We do not sort of see, you know, the New York Times and Harvard as like divinely inspired in any sense, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1134.8s)]
*  or we do not see their procedures as ones that sort of always lead to truth and wisdom. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1142.0s)]
*  We do not think that the way the US government works, you know, really works well or seems to be perfect in any respect. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  And this absence of belief is what you call enlightened. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1159.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1159.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1160.26s)]
*  It's a disenchantment from like believing in these old systems. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1160.76s)]
*  And the right thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, oh, we need to go do things Curtis's way. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1164.32s)]
*  And is basically just a greater openness of mind and a greater ability to look around and say, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1171.44s)]
*  you know, like, we just assume that our political science is superior to Aristotle's political science [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1178.8s)]
*  because our physics is superior to Aristotle's physics. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1187.04s)]
*  What if that isn't so? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  You're basically saying there's a historical and political recency bias that people are susceptible to. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1191.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think the thing that you have not quite isolated yet is why having a strong man figure would be better for people's lives. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1196.16s)]
*  Can you answer that question? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1206.48s)]
*  Number one, I think that having an effective government and an efficient government is better for people's lives. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1208.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, the best answer when I ask people to answer that question, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1213.2s)]
*  I sort of ask them to look around the room and basically point out everything in the room [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  that was made by a monarchy. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1225.2s)]
*  Because these things that we call companies are actually little monarchies. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1227.52s)]
*  And then you're looking around yourself and you see, for example, a laptop. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  And that laptop was made by Apple, which is a monarchy. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1238.24s)]
*  And it has a little thing on it that says, designed in California and made in China. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1242.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1246.64s)]
*  This is an example you use a lot where you say, if Apple ran California, wouldn't that be much better? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  Whereas if your MacBook Pro was made by the California Department of Computing, you can only imagine it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1254.72s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm here in this building and I keep forgetting to make my best argument for monarchy, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1260.64s)]
*  which is that people trust the New York Times more than any other source in the world. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1265.6s)]
*  And how is the New York Times managed? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1270.16s)]
*  It is a fifth generation hereditary absolute monarchy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1272.24s)]
*  And so we've basically taken, you know, we've taken in some ways like, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1275.28s)]
*  and this was very much the vision of the early progressives, by the way. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1280.16s)]
*  The early progressives, even like the pre-World War I progressives, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1283.28s)]
*  you go back to a book like, Drift in Mastery, you know, are very- [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1287.76s)]
*  I have to say, I find the depth of background information to be obfuscating rather than illuminating. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  How can I change that? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1301.92s)]
*  By answering the questions more directly and succinctly, I think, would be the simple reply. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1303.76s)]
*  Fine, I'll try. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1308.16s)]
*  But the thing I'd like to say, just to tie this back a little bit to something we spoke about a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1309.44s)]
*  minute ago, is, you know, there is this idea that the incoming Trump administration is interested [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1314.32s)]
*  in the idea of a more powerful executive office. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1319.92s)]
*  Are there things that, you know, you would like to see, or if you saw them, would be hints to you [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1324.56s)]
*  that the Trump administration is taking the right steps, as you might see it, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1332.1599999999999s)]
*  towards actually enacting that reality and becoming a stronger executive, a more monarchical [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1337.28s)]
*  executive office? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1345.36s)]
*  I would say that the incoming Trump administration, you know, with all due respect, and there's a lot [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1345.44s)]
*  of great people there and people who are working extremely hard, unfortunately, I would say that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1352.08s)]
*  they're essentially finding themselves in a position where they're trying to untangle the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  Gordian Knot. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1363.44s)]
*  Meaning what? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1364.16s)]
*  Meaning that they're basically trying to, let's take just NASA in specific. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1365.92s)]
*  So, for example, if you compare NASA to SpaceX, you know, that's a fine example of actually all [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1371.04s)]
*  of the principles that I've been describing, because NASA was once as efficient in SpaceX. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1376.72s)]
*  So, if you basically say, okay, at a very abstract level, forget the rest of the government, Elon, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1381.68s)]
*  go and fix NASA, right? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1389.04s)]
*  The goal of NASA is to give us cool space. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1391.44s)]
*  We feel like we're not getting enough cool space. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  You have $25 billion a year, go and do cool space. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1395.92s)]
*  I think you would get a lot more cool space under that principle. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1399.76s)]
*  But one of the basic principles of kind of the California startup way of thinking is just to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1403.44s)]
*  realize it's way easier to create a new NASA than it is to fix the old NASA. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1408.3200000000002s)]
*  And that principle extends sort of around the government. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1414.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, your ideas, and I guess has been called like sort of a neo-reactionary cast of mind, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1418.8s)]
*  are seemingly increasingly popular in the Silicon Valley world. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1427.04s)]
*  Don't you think there's some level on which that world is responding to your ideas because [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  you're just telling them what they want to hear? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1437.6s)]
*  If more people like me were in charge, things would be better. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1439.6s)]
*  It's an ideologically useful set of arguments for them to latch on. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1443.36s)]
*  The funny thing is I think that's almost the opposite of the truth. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1448.96s)]
*  It's like, let me give you a very simple illustration of this. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1452.48s)]
*  Someone I have actually never met, believe it or not, who is Elon Musk. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1455.68s)]
*  Now, Elon tweeted the other day. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1460.08s)]
*  He was like, the proper structure of government on Mars should be not just a democracy, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1462.32s)]
*  but a direct democracy. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1468.4s)]
*  Let me sort of examine the thinking behind Musk saying this because I find it sort of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1470.16s)]
*  extremely odd in a sense. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1474.8s)]
*  Because one of the things about monarchy that's been known for quite some time, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1476.96s)]
*  and again, even in very, very anti-monarchical regimes and periods, an exception is made for this, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1481.6799999999998s)]
*  is that a ship always has a captain. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1488.96s)]
*  An airplane always has a captain. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1491.76s)]
*  Basically, in any very safety-critical environment. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  You should have someone in charge. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1497.2s)]
*  You should have someone in charge. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  But the thing is you look at basically a Mars colony, and you're just like, really? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1499.84s)]
*  The citizens of the Mars colony are going to vote on how to replenish the oxygen supply [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1504.88s)]
*  or whatever? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1510.24s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1511.28s)]
*  The Mars colony that Elon establishes will be a subsidiary of SpaceX, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1512.08s)]
*  and it will have someone in charge, and it will have a command hierarchy, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1516.24s)]
*  just like SpaceX does. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1519.52s)]
*  So I'm like, Elon, when you say that this should be a democracy, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1521.68s)]
*  what are the people voting on? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1526.0s)]
*  There's this world of actually real governance that someone like Elon Musk lives in every day. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1528.24s)]
*  Actually, applying that world, applying that thinking to being like, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  this thinking is directly contradictory, in a sense, to the ideals that I was taught in this society. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1545.04s)]
*  That's a really difficult cognitive dissonance problem, even if you're Elon Musk. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1554.0s)]
*  You know, when I hear you talk about the need for a monarch, and we'll just use that term, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1558.08s)]
*  encompassing CEOs or dictators. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1567.52s)]
*  I'll just say monarch for now. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1569.36s)]
*  Monarch is good. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1570.0s)]
*  It's a neutral term. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1570.64s)]
*  It would be an understatement to say that humanity's record with monarchs is mixed at best. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1571.6s)]
*  Roman Empire under Marcus Aurelius seems like it went pretty well. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1580.72s)]
*  Under Nero, not so much. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1584.48s)]
*  Spain's Charles III is a monarch you point to a lot. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  He's sort of your favorite monarch. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1591.28s)]
*  Louis XIV, he's like starting wars like they're going out of business. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1594.48s)]
*  Those are all sort of before the age of democracy. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1598.64s)]
*  And then the monarchs in the age of democracy are just terrible. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1602.4s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1605.8400000000001s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying a phrase like this. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1606.5600000000002s)]
*  If you put Hitler aside and only look at Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Pinochet, Idi Amin, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1608.0s)]
*  we're looking at people responsible for the deaths of something like 75 to 100 million people. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1620.08s)]
*  So given that historical precedent, do we really want to try dictatorship? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1624.4s)]
*  Your question is the most important question of all, because basically understanding [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1629.76s)]
*  why Hitler was so bad, why Stalin was so bad is really essential to the riddle of the 20th century. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1634.72s)]
*  But I think it's important to note that we don't see for the rest of European and world history, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1643.52s)]
*  human history as a whole is a mixed bag. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1650.48s)]
*  The history of the age of democracy in the last 250 years is also a mixed bag. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  We don't see in human history what? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1660.24s)]
*  If you didn't finish the talk. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  A Holocaust. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1662.5600000000002s)]
*  You can pull the camera way back and basically say, wow, in Europe since basically the [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1663.92s)]
*  establishment of European civilization from like 1000 AD to 1750 AD, we didn't have this [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1669.92s)]
*  kind of chaos and violence. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1679.04s)]
*  And then you can't separate Hitler and Stalin from the sort of global democratic revolution [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1680.8000000000002s)]
*  that they're a part of. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1688.0s)]
*  But one thing I noticed when I was going through your stuff is that you make these [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1688.88s)]
*  historical claims like the one you just made about sort of no genocide in Europe between [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1693.68s)]
*  1000 AD and the Holocaust essentially. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1699.3600000000001s)]
*  And then I poke around and think, huh, is that true? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1703.2s)]
*  And then you think, well, there was Tamerlane. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1705.28s)]
*  Tamerlane was not in Europe. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1709.52s)]
*  I mean Europe though. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1710.96s)]
*  Well, it's okay on the edges of Europe. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  And then that's sort of like a goalpost shift there. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1714.3200000000002s)]
*  But then or you think, well, there's the French wars of religion. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1716.48s)]
*  They killed millions of people, including the massacre of the Huguenots. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1721.68s)]
*  So I often find, why don't you just scratch a little at some of the historical- [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1726.0800000000002s)]
*  There was no massacre of Huguenots. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1729.44s)]
*  I think you're confusing it with the Sack of Bezié and the massacre of the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1731.2s)]
*  Alpagensians. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1737.04s)]
*  So they got massacred, not the Huguenots. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1739.8400000000001s)]
*  But the thing is when people look at the Holocaust, they saw it like a new species [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1740.4s)]
*  of devil tree that had not really existed in the world in that way before. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1745.04s)]
*  When you see a city stacked in the Middle Ages, you see just like wild and disciplined [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1751.52s)]
*  troops raging around. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1756.0800000000002s)]
*  You don't see lines of people marched to their deaths. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1758.0s)]
*  My skepticism comes from what I feel like is a pretty strong cherry picking of historical [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1761.8400000000001s)]
*  incidents to support your arguments. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1770.16s)]
*  And then I look and you're like, the incidents that you're pointed to are either not [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1772.4s)]
*  necessarily factually settled or there's a different way of looking at them. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1775.92s)]
*  But I actually want to, just because some of the historical references are now actually [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1779.52s)]
*  making my head hurt, I just want to ask a couple very concrete questions about some [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1785.92s)]
*  of the stuff that you've written about race, for example, which seems pretty provocative [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1791.76s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1799.44s)]
*  I'll read you some examples. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1800.08s)]
*  This is the trouble with white nationalism. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1801.76s)]
*  It is strategically barren. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1804.08s)]
*  It offers no effective political program. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1805.68s)]
*  To me, the trouble with white nationalism is that it's racist, not that it's strategically [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1807.92s)]
*  unsophisticated. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  There's two more. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1813.04s)]
*  There's two more. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  It is very difficult to argue that the Civil War made anyone's life more pleasant, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1814.5600000000002s)]
*  including that of freed slaves. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1820.3200000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1823.92s)]
*  The third one. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1825.2s)]
*  The third one. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1826.0s)]
*  If you ask me to condemn Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, but adore Nelson Mandela, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1828.16s)]
*  perhaps you have a mother you'd like to f***. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1836.56s)]
*  So... [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, let's go through each... [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1842.72s)]
*  And this is a guy who's saying, we'll live through... [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1844.8s)]
*  Let's go... [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1847.84s)]
*  We'll achieve harmony. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1848.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's go through each of those examples. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1849.76s)]
*  When you look, for example, at Mandela, the reason I said that, most people don't know [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  this, there was a little contra-tomps when Mandela was released because he actually had [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1859.36s)]
*  to be taken off the terrorist list. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1864.88s)]
*  I mean, maybe the more relevant point is that Nelson Mandela was in jail for opposing a [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1866.88s)]
*  viciously racist apartheid regime, but... [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1871.44s)]
*  The viciously racist apartheid regime, basically, they had him on the terrorist list. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1873.7600000000002s)]
*  So if you look at... [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1879.2800000000002s)]
*  Let's get to the other two. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1880.0s)]
*  Again, your quote was, if you ask me to condemn Anders Breivik, but adore Nelson Mandela... [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1882.5600000000002s)]
*  I'd prefer to condemn them both. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1889.7600000000002s)]
*  And the thing is, basically, when you look at the impact, you see... [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  What does this have to do with equating Anders Breivik, who shot people on some bizarre, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1894.16s)]
*  deluded mission to rid Norway of Islam with Nelson Mandela? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1900.3200000000002s)]
*  Because they're both terrorists. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1905.0400000000002s)]
*  Because they basically both violated the rules of war in the same way, and they both basically [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1907.2s)]
*  killed innocent people. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1912.88s)]
*  We valorize terrorism all the time. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1914.16s)]
*  This valorization... [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1916.4s)]
*  So Gandhi, then, is your model. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  Martin Luther King, nonviolent. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1919.28s)]
*  It's more complicated than that, but I could say things about either. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1922.32s)]
*  But let's move on to one of your other examples. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1926.7199999999998s)]
*  I think the best way to basically grapple with that period directly... [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1929.28s)]
*  Which period are we talking about now? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  1860s. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1935.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about African Americans in the 1860s. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1937.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1940.3999999999999s)]
*  The thing that you can do, that any Times reader can do, just go to your Google bar and Google [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1940.9599999999998s)]
*  slave narratives. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1945.1999999999998s)]
*  Just go and read random slave narratives. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  Get their experience of the time. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1949.52s)]
*  So the thing is that basically the treatment of the freed slaves after the war is extremely... [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1951.6s)]
*  There was a recent historian who published a thing, and I think this is... [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1959.12s)]
*  I would dispute this. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  This number is too high. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1963.2s)]
*  But his estimate was that something like a quarter of all the freedmen basically die [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1964.56s)]
*  in between 1865 and 1870. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1971.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1974.56s)]
*  Again, I can't speak to the veracity of that. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1975.12s)]
*  That's too high. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1977.52s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1978.0s)]
*  The thing is basically... [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1978.96s)]
*  But you're saying there are historical examples in slave narratives where the freed slaves [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1980.64s)]
*  themselves expressed regret at having been freed. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1985.0400000000002s)]
*  But this to me is another prime example of how you selectively read history. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  Because if you read other slave narratives where they talk about the horrible brutality [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=1996.24s)]
*  of it, so so what that there are some slave narratives... [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2000.88s)]
*  And I see this. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2003.7600000000002s)]
*  How does that justify... [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2005.0400000000002s)]
*  And I see this in the conversation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2005.92s)]
*  Made anyone's life more pleasant. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2006.64s)]
*  Difficult to argue that the civil war made anyone's life more pleasant, including freed [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2009.0400000000002s)]
*  slaves. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2013.44s)]
*  Their children were no longer sold out from under them. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2014.24s)]
*  When I said anyone, okay, first of all, when I said anyone, I was talking about [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2016.5600000000002s)]
*  a population group rather than individuals. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2022.0800000000002s)]
*  But are you seriously arguing that the era of slavery was somehow better than the era... [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2024.3200000000002s)]
*  The era of 1865 to 1875 was absolutely... [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2030.56s)]
*  And the war itself wasn't good either. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2037.6799999999998s)]
*  But if you look at the living conditions for an African American in the south, they are [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2039.76s)]
*  absolutely at their nadir between 1865 and 1875. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  They are very, very bad because basically this economic system has been disrupted. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2049.04s)]
*  But abolition was a necessary step to get through that period towards to make people free. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2053.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2059.12s)]
*  I can't believe I'm arguing this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2059.44s)]
*  Brazil abolished slavery in the 1880s without a civil war. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  And so the thing is, when you look at basically the cost of the war or the meaning of the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2064.48s)]
*  war, you're basically just like... [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2070.08s)]
*  It just visited this huge amount of destruction on all sorts of people, black and white, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2072.08s)]
*  just massive. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2078.64s)]
*  I'm just like, all of these evils and all of these goods existed in people at this time. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2079.68s)]
*  And what I'm fighting against in both of those quotes, also in the way [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2085.44s)]
*  the people respond to Pryvec, I'm like, basically you're responding in this cartoonish way [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2088.72s)]
*  to something that terrorism, which is what is the difference between a terrorist and [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2095.52s)]
*  a freedom fighter? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2101.2s)]
*  That's a really important question in 20th century history. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2102.64s)]
*  To say that I'm going to have a strong opinion about this stuff without having an answer [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  to that question, I think is really difficult and wrong. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2110.08s)]
*  Now, maybe you think I haven't been red-pilled or whatever, or I'm not thinking through [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2114.08s)]
*  these issues enough, but I feel like to me, you call it cartoonish, I call it very morally [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2122.16s)]
*  clear, I can say something like, I think slavery was bad. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2127.68s)]
*  I'm glad there are no longer enslaved people. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2131.2s)]
*  And then to hear you then say, well, you have to look at it from this other perspective, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2134.0s)]
*  this is a one-dimensional view of history. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2138.96s)]
*  I think, well, that's a, no, I think it's pretty cut and dry. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2140.96s)]
*  It just is very fascinating to me that your ideas, which strike me as pretty extreme, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2144.48s)]
*  they were fringe ideas to me that apparently are no longer on the fringe. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2150.32s)]
*  And that's, I don't know, what do you think that says about conservatism today? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that American conservatism is in the long and very, very difficult grieving process [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2160.64s)]
*  of realizing that it has always been a fraud. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2168.08s)]
*  And I think one of the especially dangers in American conservatism is that there's so [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2170.88s)]
*  much grift in it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2176.0s)]
*  And so much of it consumes so much energy and so much attention and produces so little. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2177.36s)]
*  You are still a factor of a hundred from being able to give the people who are voting for you [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  and donating to you anything like what they imagine they're going to get from you. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2189.1200000000003s)]
*  When you say it's a fraud, I take that to mean insofar as its conservatism is just... [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2194.24s)]
*  The Washington generals are never going to win the game. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2204.16s)]
*  It just doesn't have the power to give anything that it promises. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2206.8s)]
*  After the break, I call Curtis back to ask more about the incoming administration. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2214.24s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me again. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2220.16s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2222.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2223.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2224.48s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2224.88s)]
*  Let's have some more fun. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2225.76s)]
*  So you do so often draw on the history of the pre-democratic era, which is a historical [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2226.64s)]
*  period sort of exactly coterminous with, for example, women being treated as second-class [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2233.76s)]
*  citizens. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2241.04s)]
*  And the status of women in that time period, which you use, valorize, is not something I've [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2242.24s)]
*  really seen come up in your writings. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2247.68s)]
*  Do you feel like your arguments take enough into account the way that sort of monarchies [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2250.0s)]
*  and dictatorships historically tend not to be great for big swathes of demographics? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2257.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2266.56s)]
*  So let's look at enfranchisement in specific. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2267.04s)]
*  So when I look at the status of women in, say, a Jane Austen novel, which is well before [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2270.64s)]
*  enfranchisement, it actually seems kind of okay. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2276.32s)]
*  The woman in Jane Austen's book seems to be fine. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2279.52s)]
*  Who are desperate to land a husband because they have no access to income without them. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2282.16s)]
*  Well, you know, have you ever seen anything like that in the 21st century? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2285.92s)]
*  I mean, the whole class in Jane Austen's world is the class of like UBI-earning aristocrats, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2294.48s)]
*  You know, but are you not willing to say that there were aspects of political life [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2294.72s)]
*  in the era of kings that were inferior or provided less liberty for people than political [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2300.56s)]
*  life does today? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2307.84s)]
*  It's very hard. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2308.56s)]
*  So first of all, when we say liberty, for example, so you did a thing that people often [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2309.52s)]
*  do where they confuse freedom with power. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2315.84s)]
*  Free speech is a freedom. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2319.2799999999997s)]
*  The right to vote is a form of power. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2321.36s)]
*  And so the assumption that you're making is that through getting the vote in the early [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2323.92s)]
*  20th century in England and America, women made life better for themselves. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2332.4s)]
*  Do you think it's better that women got the vote? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2339.28s)]
*  First of all, I don't believe in actually voting at all. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2342.48s)]
*  Do you vote? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2345.28s)]
*  No. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2346.7200000000003s)]
*  I believe that voting is providing this sort of almost kind of [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2348.32s)]
*  pornographic stimulus. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2351.84s)]
*  It sort of becomes more like supporting your football team or something. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2353.36s)]
*  It basically enables you to feel like you have a certain status. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2357.36s)]
*  But the thing is, what does this power mean to you is really the most important question. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that what it means to most people today is that it provides a [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2367.92s)]
*  source of meaning for them. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2373.36s)]
*  It makes them feel relevant. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2374.6400000000003s)]
*  It makes them feel like they matter in a sense. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2376.48s)]
*  And I think that there's something deeply illusory about that sense of mattering that [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2379.52s)]
*  sort of goes up against the very, very important question of we need a government that is [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2384.72s)]
*  actually good and that actually works and don't have one. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  The solution that you propose has to do with, like we've said multiple times now, installing, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2396.16s)]
*  we call it a monarchy, call it a CEO figure, and the result of investing an individual [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2405.04s)]
*  with the power of a CEO would be hopefully a more efficient, more responsive, more effective [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2412.48s)]
*  government. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2421.52s)]
*  Why do you seem to have such faith in the ability of CEOs? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2422.64s)]
*  I mean, most startups fail. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2427.36s)]
*  And we can all point to CEOs who are effective, CEOs who have been ineffective. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2428.72s)]
*  Putting that aside, that a CEO or dictator is more likely to think of [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2433.44s)]
*  estate citizens as pure economic units rather than living, breathing human beings who [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2438.5600000000004s)]
*  want to flourish in their lives, who deserve the dignity of a secure retirement or meaningful [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2445.44s)]
*  leisure time. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2450.0800000000004s)]
*  So why are you so confident that a CEO would be the kind of leader who could bring about better [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2451.28s)]
*  lives for people? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2456.4s)]
*  It just seems like such a simplistic way of thinking. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  It's not a simplistic way of thinking. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2461.2s)]
*  And having worked inside the kind of salt mines where CEOs do their CEOing business [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2463.52s)]
*  and having been a CEO myself, I think I have a better sense of it maybe unfortunately than [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2470.72s)]
*  most people. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2479.12s)]
*  Last time we spoke, I used the example of imagine if your MacBook had to be made by [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2480.0s)]
*  the California Department of Computing, or if your car, your electric car had to be made by [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2485.92s)]
*  the US Department of Transportation. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2493.6s)]
*  The things that make companies succeed or fail- [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2496.64s)]
*  I will say Apple and Tesla, by the way, though, have both benefited greatly from government [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2499.28s)]
*  help in various forms. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2504.64s)]
*  Well, they live in a governed society. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2506.2400000000002s)]
*  And so the thing is basically when libertarians talk about Apple and Tesla, they're saying, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2508.16s)]
*  here are the benefits of freedom, etc., etc., etc. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2514.48s)]
*  That's sort of true in a sense. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2519.12s)]
*  But the benefit of freedom is that these organizations have used freedom to establish [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2520.64s)]
*  monarchies, which are completely top-down command units. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2526.4s)]
*  We've gotten away from the central question a little bit. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2531.36s)]
*  Why are you so confident that CEOs- [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2536.08s)]
*  That's the question of efficiency. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2538.0s)]
*  When I basically look at systems run by CEOs, I'm just like, basically, I think that if you took [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2541.84s)]
*  any of the Fortune 500 CEOs, some of them are good, some of them are bad, but the overall [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2548.96s)]
*  quality- just pick one at random and put him or her in charge of Washington, and I think [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2555.28s)]
*  you'd get something much, much better than what's there. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2561.92s)]
*  It doesn't have to be Elon Musk. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2565.84s)]
*  The median performance is so much better. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2567.6s)]
*  But you asked something that I think is a more important and more interesting question, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2571.12s)]
*  which is you're like, okay, America needs a CEO who will be economically efficient. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2575.2s)]
*  The CEO who will be economically efficient will think of human beings as pure economic units [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2581.04s)]
*  and will do things like- [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, no, just the idea that a company has goals that are not necessarily the same goals as [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2590.24s)]
*  what a government might have insofar as providing for its citizens. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2597.2s)]
*  Perfect question. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2600.96s)]
*  The thing is, normally, we think of the goal of a company as making a profit or just selling [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2602.0800000000004s)]
*  more stuff, but that's not actually really the goal of a company. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2607.6000000000004s)]
*  The real goal of a company is to maximize the worth of its assets and to make the stock price [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2612.0s)]
*  go up. It's basically one of the ways to kind of unify the worldview of, say, Charles I and [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2618.8s)]
*  Elon Musk, is to realize that when Charles I is thinking about his people, he is both thinking [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2626.72s)]
*  of them as economic assets and as human assets. He basically wants to see his country thrive. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2634.3199999999997s)]
*  In order to see his country thrive, he wants people to be- Of course, he wants them to be [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2642.72s)]
*  producing as much wool or whatever England exports as possible. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2648.48s)]
*  The sense of him being the pater patriae, the father of the country, and feeling about [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2653.52s)]
*  the people in his society, not exactly the way a parent should feel about [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2663.2799999999997s)]
*  his children, but sort of like the way a parent should feel about his children. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2670.16s)]
*  That sense of having a reciprocal obligation. My goal as a CEO is not to rake in the bucks, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2673.76s)]
*  but to make my operation flourish. Earlier, you had said that you believe that [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2683.44s)]
*  regardless of what his goals are or what he says, Trump isn't likely to actually get anything [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2689.1200000000003s)]
*  transformative accomplished just because of the entrenched government bureaucracy that exists. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  But putting that aside, what is your opinion of Trump generally? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2702.88s)]
*  I think that Trump- The funny thing is I talked about FDR earlier in our conversation. I think [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2710.56s)]
*  actually a lot of people in different directions might not appreciate this comparison, but I think [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2720.2400000000002s)]
*  that in a lot of ways, Trump is very reminiscent of FDR because what FDR had was this tremendous [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2727.68s)]
*  charisma and self-confidence combined with a tremendous ability to be the center of the room, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  be the leader, cut through the BS, and make things happen. I think one of the main differences between [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2747.2s)]
*  Trump and FDR that has really held Trump back is of course that FDR is from one of America's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2755.2s)]
*  first families. He's a hereditary aristocrat, and Trump is not really from America's social [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2766.16s)]
*  upper class. I think the fact that Trump is not really from America's social upper class has hurt [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2773.92s)]
*  him a lot in terms of his confidence. I think it's hurt him in his ability to delegate to and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2780.56s)]
*  trust people who are not part of his family. I think that that's sort of limited him as a leader [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2787.36s)]
*  in various ways. One of the encouraging things that I do see is I do see him executing with somewhat [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2794.16s)]
*  more confidence this time around. It's almost like he actually feels like he knows what he's doing. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2801.52s)]
*  That's something that's very helpful because insecurity and fragility is just... [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2807.6s)]
*  It's his Achilles heel, I think. What's your Achilles heel? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2815.3599999999997s)]
*  What's my Achilles heel? I think I also have self-confidence issues. I won't bet fully on my [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2819.6s)]
*  own convictions. Are there ways in which you think your insecurity manifests itself in your [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2827.7599999999998s)]
*  political thinking? That's a good question. I think that if you look at especially my older work, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2832.72s)]
*  I think I had this kind of joint consciousness that, okay, I feel like I'm on to something here, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2842.72s)]
*  but I also like the idea that people would be in 2025 taking this stuff as seriously [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2850.8799999999997s)]
*  as they are now. When I was writing in 2007, 2008, I was completely serious. I am completely serious, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2858.56s)]
*  but it led to a certain level of... It's like when you hit me with the most outrageous quotes [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  that you could find from my writing in 2008 or whatever, I'm basically like, yeah, the sentiments [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2875.68s)]
*  behind that I can explain and articulate, and they were serious sentiments and they're serious. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2881.76s)]
*  Now, would I have expressed it that way? Would I have trolled? I'm always trying to get less [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2889.2000000000003s)]
*  trollish. Over time, you'll see that I've definitely gotten less trolly. On the other hand, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2896.0s)]
*  if you read my recent blog posts, I can't really resist trolling Elon Musk, which might be part of [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2903.76s)]
*  the reason why I've never met Elon Musk. Do you think your trolling instinct has maybe gotten out [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2909.52s)]
*  of hand? No, it definitely hasn't gotten. It hasn't gone far. No, the trolling, what I realize [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2916.8s)]
*  when I look back is that actually- Do you think your trolling has now become a political program? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2925.84s)]
*  The instinct to revise things from the bottom up is very much not a trollish instinct. It's [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2931.84s)]
*  a serious and important thing that I think the world needs. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  I got to say, there were a lot of things to do with your ideas that we just didn't get to. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2948.1600000000003s)]
*  The thing that I still find myself deeply unconvinced about is [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2955.04s)]
*  why blowing up democracy rather than trying to make it better would somehow lead to better [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2962.16s)]
*  lives for the people who are struggling the most? Well, I can lead a horse to water, of course. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2967.8399999999997s)]
*  The, I think that as you start to, as the walls fall away and you start to explore ideas [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  that are outside the very narrow bubble of the present that we live in, because there's no, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2987.68s)]
*  I think it's impossible to deny that the variety of ideas in the space, which intelligent, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=2995.36s)]
*  thoughtful people like you sort of consider has grown sharply narrower in the 20th century. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3003.52s)]
*  If there's really one thing that I kind of want to do the most, say, with this conversation [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3013.28s)]
*  is to kind of make people feel like they can basically step outside of the kind of [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3018.56s)]
*  very small box that they grew up in. And they can say, not everything outside that box is perfect. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3026.32s)]
*  Many things outside that box are absolutely horrible. I'm not asking anyone to become a [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3034.32s)]
*  Nazi or an anti-Semite or even a misogynist, whatever that means. There are cases in which [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3038.4s)]
*  our judgment of the past is completely right. And yet there are also ways in which the whole [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3045.36s)]
*  past would very unanimously point to things that we're doing and saying, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3051.44s)]
*  and say, that's crazy. I can't believe you're doing that. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8&t=3057.44s)]
