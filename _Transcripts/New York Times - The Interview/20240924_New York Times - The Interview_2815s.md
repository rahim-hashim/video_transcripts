# Change Can Be Beautiful. Just Ask Will Ferrell and Harper Steele.
**New York Times - The Interview:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0)
*  From the New York Times, this is the Interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  How well do we know our friends, our neighbors, ourselves? In the new documentary Will & Harper, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=8.76s)]
*  Will Ferrell and his best friend and frequent collaborator Harper Steele take a cross-country [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=14.88s)]
*  road trip together to try to answer those questions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=19.04s)]
*  Hitting the highway on a quest for meaning is a classic American story. But this time [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=22.32s)]
*  there's a fresh angle. Harper is a trans woman who came out to her friends, including [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=26.6s)]
*  Will, two years ago. That was after years as a comedy writer, many of them at Saturday [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  Night Live, where they both worked and where Harper eventually became a head writer. They [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  both have mixed feelings about their work at SNL, as they explained to me. They also [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=40.04s)]
*  had some ups and downs on their road trip, which was ultimately a chance for them to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=44.0s)]
*  talk through what Harper's transition means for their friendship and for them both to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  get a clearer sense of how their fellow Americans really feel about transgender identity. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=51.04s)]
*  The film's soul-searching often comes wrapped in laughs. But given how politicized trans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=56.8s)]
*  rights have become, especially in the past few years, even situations set up for comedy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  can turn tense. There's a scene in the movie where Harper and Will stop for what they hope [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=65.1s)]
*  is a silly, fun dinner slash steak-eating challenge at an Amarillo, Texas steakhouse, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=68.8s)]
*  and things get, well, no one is laughing by the time they leave. That steakhouse scene [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=73.84s)]
*  and this emotionally wide-ranging film evoke feelings in me that work by Will Ferrell hasn't [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=79.52s)]
*  before. And I say that as someone who will argue vehemently for the deeper resonance [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=83.92s)]
*  of the gloriously idiotic Step Brothers. That's the movie I've seen most in my life. But the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=87.48s)]
*  point, and this was underscored by my conversation with these two, as well as by their movie, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=92.36s)]
*  is that while change can be pretty tricky, if we're lucky, it can also make life a lot [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=97.32s)]
*  better. Here's my conversation with Will Ferrell and Harper Steel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you guys again for taking the time to do this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=109.92s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=112.32s)]
*  I never know how much has been explained to the people I talk to, what it is we're doing. Can [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=114.0s)]
*  I give you a little context about what the scene is, Mike? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=118.48s)]
*  The history of the New York Times? Ridiculous. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Whoa. Started in 1892, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=122.0s)]
*  Sorry. This is going to happen a lot to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=126.96s)]
*  Okay. Yes, please. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=129.92s)]
*  Sorry. I need to compose myself to sound professional. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. Come on. This isn't the New York Times, for God's sake. This isn't... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=134.88s)]
*  That's hard hitting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=138.48s)]
*  The planes dealer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  The very hard hitting first question. How did you guys become friends? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  We became friends at Saturday Night Live. We were hired in the summer or fall of 1995. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=149.6s)]
*  And we were all this brand new group, so no one knew each other. And one day, Harper and I went [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  to lunch. A very pivotal lunch for me. Tell me about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=170.72s)]
*  Already, even though there was a brand new cast and a brand new group of writers, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=176.72s)]
*  cliques had started to form. And I was kind of on the outside looking in. And subsequently, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=181.36s)]
*  I found out later, a lot of other people were like, who's the tall, kind of maybe sort of handsome [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=187.92s)]
*  guy? What does he do? He doesn't seem funny. And Harper and I had lunch. And she reported back to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=194.48s)]
*  the gang, hey, by the way, that guy, he actually is funny. He's just kind of quiet. And I think [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=201.6s)]
*  in some ways that like opened the door to people accepting me a little bit. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=208.0s)]
*  Will, if he's not on camera, he's kind of boring. He's boring. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=214.24s)]
*  Wait, Harper, do you remember the first sketch you wrote for Will? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  No, because I probably wrote a few for him. But my best moment early on at SNL was I wrote a sketch [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=233.84s)]
*  for Will called Zipper Boots. And I was not doing well on the show. I was not getting stuff on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=241.28s)]
*  show. I hadn't figured it out. I was just kind of losing the competitive battle in that environment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  When I'm losing, I generally go, oh, fuck it. And so then I'll write something that I guess makes me [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=254.32s)]
*  laugh. So I wrote this sketch called Zipper Boots. It's just the talk show guy who stops every [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=260.64s)]
*  interview to show off this new pair of zipper boots he's got. Anyway, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  Lauren did not pick it for the show. It's not a good sketch. But it did get laughs. Will, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm sitting in rewrites. I'm the lowest you can be on Thursday with nothing on the show. You're a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=278.0s)]
*  failure. And Will walks in with a box for me. And it's my very own pair of zipper boots. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  And I know it's funny, but it really was sort of like because Will had started to do pretty [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=292.16s)]
*  good on the show. And so I, sad to say, I needed that validation. And yeah, I still have them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=298.88s)]
*  You just referred in passing to SNL being kind of competitive. And I think that's from the outside, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=309.04s)]
*  people have a perception of the show as maybe not the easiest workplace environment. I don't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=317.12s)]
*  think of comedians as like, I think of them as people who like to tease, maybe not the gentlest [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=324.0s)]
*  with displays of vulnerability. I wonder for you, Harper, given the internal disconnect you were [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=330.8s)]
*  feeling, what was the workplace environment like for you? I mean, maybe you found it to be a place [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=338.88s)]
*  of escape or maybe you did find it inhibiting. I also realized I've just drastically changed the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=343.84s)]
*  tone of this interview on a dime. We can do that. We'll bring it back to our tone. Don't worry. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll mess it up. No, that's a good question. I think if you look in a comedy room period, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  you're looking at a lot of dissociation and people who are hiding things. We know that because people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  are drug addicts. Darrell Hammond said that he was cutting himself. I mean, he has this in his book. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=369.2s)]
*  So people are dealing with things that comedy helps cover. So yeah, you're walking into that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=376.8s)]
*  environment and you don't want to let a lot of your vulnerability come out. I can't say I was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=382.56s)]
*  sitting around there thinking I was a woman. I just know that it's a scary environment. So [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=391.68s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. Without a doubt, I use comedy from a very early age to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=398.08s)]
*  deflect. So it's a professional deflecting environment. You're walking in there and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=405.2s)]
*  as soon as anything got too real, like we're doing today, you got to find a laugh. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But in the film, you basically had no idea that Harper was struggling, certainly at the time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=419.68s)]
*  In retrospect, do you feel like you understood or had a sense of what your friend was going through? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=432.16s)]
*  No. No. She hit it really well. Once again, through the mask of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=439.28s)]
*  doing bits and joking around and everything like that, we were always pretty much on the surface [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=450.8s)]
*  level. It's not like I can think back and, aha, so that's what I mean. In retrospect, this could be a thing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=458.96s)]
*  Harper to me was this lovable curmudgeon who was kind of grumpy and very grumpy, even though [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=472.4s)]
*  I always saw your silliness. So I would purposely come up to Steele and be like, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  how you doing? Come on, give me a little hug. And you would hate it. You would hate it. And I would [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=492.0s)]
*  hug you as hard as I could. Now, in retrospect, that's something. Now, in this moment, I'm thinking, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  oh, OK. Yeah, you did not want to be engaged in that way at all. But that's what I would always, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=507.44s)]
*  oh, I'm going to give Harper a hug here. She hates it. But I don't know. That's funny. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=517.36s)]
*  I think the 50th anniversary of the show is next year. Do you feel like the show, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=523.6s)]
*  inasmuch as you pay attention, has it changed since you've been on it? What's your sense of how [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=531.04s)]
*  the show has evolved over time? Geez. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=535.52s)]
*  I think the show has stayed exactly the same in the sense that it's just forever generational. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=543.36s)]
*  The older generations reminisce how it used to be so much better. And anyone in high school or [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=552.64s)]
*  college thinks it's the greatest thing. But I think we both kind of check it out every now and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=559.92s)]
*  then, but not... Yeah, I don't watch it that much. I feel like it's more inclusive. I mean, I just [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  know the staff and the cast feels a little more inclusive than in our era. That's changed, for [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  sure. To echo Will's point, I've always said this. There are two or three good sketches [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=580.8s)]
*  every show, sometimes just one, and the rest of them are shit. However, we all don't agree on what [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=590.8s)]
*  those three sketches are. Go back and watch a whole show from 78. There's a bunch of shit. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  It's very meandering. Yeah. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's some classics. So that's what I think every era does. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=608.48s)]
*  You mentioned that the show is more inclusive now. Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=614.88s)]
*  And that seems to be inarguable. Yeah. But do you ever think back to material, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=617.92s)]
*  this is for both of you guys, material that you wrote or were in and thought, well, that was a [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=623.76s)]
*  bad way into that joke, or I wouldn't have handled that subject like that today? Anything sort of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  makes you cringe a little? A good third of my comedy? Yeah. Yeah. I would say I wouldn't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=636.4s)]
*  write that today or I wouldn't handle it that way today. No, there were a few times even while [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=642.0s)]
*  seeing the sketch mounted, I would go, ugh. And I think that that is a fear-based [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=648.48s)]
*  thing where you feel like you've got to please an audience or you're losing your job and you make [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=656.24s)]
*  a decision that is not, I can't say this for Will. I feel like he was more secure in who he was. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=661.68s)]
*  But for me, I probably felt a lot of fear, imposter syndrome. I might have overstepped bounds [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=669.68s)]
*  that even I was, I know I did. Yeah. I think I'd have to go back and actually review shows. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  But I'm sure there'd be a fair amount where you'd lament the choice or, I mean, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=685.3599999999999s)]
*  in a way the cast, you're kind of given this assignment, so I'm going to blame the writers. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He's not culpable at all. Just following orders. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I think that's the nature of the show. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  I wrote Monica Lewicki stuff I wasn't proud of. I wrote some good Britney stuff and some stuff [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=704.56s)]
*  that I'm not as proud of, Britney Spears. And so I wrote some Clinton things I wasn't proud of. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would not approach it in the same way at all and I don't. So, you know, I'm just moving on. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=719.92s)]
*  I have to. The Janet Reno character hits a false note now. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=725.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's something, yeah, I wouldn't choose to do now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=731.12s)]
*  This kind of bums me out though. This is something that I actually feel a little bit differently [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  about it. I understand the laugh is a drag laugh. It's the, hey, look at this guy's got an address [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=740.16s)]
*  and that's funny. And it's absolutely not funny. It's absolutely a way that we should be able to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=746.08s)]
*  live in the world. However, with performers and actors, I do like a sense of play. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=751.5200000000001s)]
*  I do think people should play with characters. This is an interesting question to me. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=760.48s)]
*  Do queer people like the birdcage or do they not like it? Robin Williams, at least as far as we know, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=767.36s)]
*  was not a gay man and yet he spent about a half of his comedy career doing a swishy gay guy [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=777.12s)]
*  on camera. Do people think that that's funny or is it just hurtful? And I've heard from gay men [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=785.28s)]
*  that it was funny and I've heard from gay men it was very hurtful. And I understand both. I just, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=791.52s)]
*  sometimes I wonder if, and I'm the most woke, I am accusably purple haired woke. I'm telling you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=796.64s)]
*  But I do wonder if sometimes we take away the joy of playing when we take away some of the range [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=806.4s)]
*  that some performers, especially comedy performers, can do. So now I've got some questions about the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=813.52s)]
*  movie. Harbour, you say in the film that one of the things you've always loved to do is sort of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=820.96s)]
*  take these cross-country drives, just explore the country by yourself and you like to go out of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=825.84s)]
*  way bars and diners and stuff like that. Whose idea was it that Will would go along with you [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  on your first of these cross-country drives after transitioning? Well, it was Will's idea. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=836.48s)]
*  Most definitely it was Will's idea. I wouldn't have never thought of something like that, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=844.32s)]
*  nor when he suggested it to me did I think it was a good idea. So it took a little bit of a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=848.08s)]
*  thought process for me a couple months before I actually thought, well, there might be something [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=854.88s)]
*  here. It wasn't my first time crossing as Harper. I crossed, but I was intensely fearful. Like I [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=859.2s)]
*  would stay in, I slept in my truck, which is something I did all the time anyway. And I would [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=869.2s)]
*  not go into like my favorite kinds of places, the restaurants, the truck stops, the bars. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=875.12s)]
*  I didn't do any of that, but I don't know. So it was a different thing with Will. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=879.92s)]
*  So Will, can you explain to me what your thinking was? I mean, if Harper said initially [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=886.48s)]
*  she wasn't jazzed about the idea, what was your sort of pitch to her about why to do it? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=892.56s)]
*  I don't really know. I told her like, I'm not trying to exploit our friendship. Please, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  I hope you know that. But this is a crazy enough idea. And by the way, this is the first time we'd [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=903.92s)]
*  seen each other. We were having coffee in my backyard and we're both nervous. So we're sitting [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=913.76s)]
*  down and we're kind of like, how's it been going? Oh my God, just catching up. And that's when I [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=921.68s)]
*  kind of sprung it on her. Because I'd heard from a mutual friend of ours that she was lamenting the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=929.2s)]
*  fact that I don't know if I can do these same type of road trips the way I used to. And I said to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=935.44s)]
*  Harper, what if we went on a road trip? I went with you and we film it. And I'll be kind of like your [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=942.4000000000001s)]
*  offensive lineman, so to speak. And you know, a chance for me to actually kind of ask all the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=951.84s)]
*  questions that I have. And we can kind of examine what's changed, what's not. But I totally get it [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=958.0s)]
*  if you don't want to. But I think Harper finally landed on the square that we could help people, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=964.24s)]
*  possibly. But I don't know. It didn't come from a social justice warrior kind of place at all. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=974.4s)]
*  I mean, we're both producers and writers and he's kind of an actor. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=979.36s)]
*  I'm a mid-level A-lister or I'm a top-tier B-lister. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=988.64s)]
*  We both create a lot of shit. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=994.4s)]
*  I'm falling to top-tier B-list as the years go on. Yes, I'll take that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=997.92s)]
*  Get the paycheck still. No, I think we both make a lot of crap. So I think that's how we [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1002.4s)]
*  think sometimes, too. Just like we want to go do something fun. What can we make out of it? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1008.96s)]
*  I just think that's part of our process. But I had to talk myself into doing it. And [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1015.44s)]
*  again, I can't really pin down the motive. There is a social justice part of this because I'm [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1022.24s)]
*  reading the newspaper every day and more and more trans bills are being offered up to every state [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  in the country. And it's making me think like, well, you're a fucking old lady. You can do [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1034.48s)]
*  something. And so I'm thinking about that. But then I'm also thinking like, hey, I would like [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1040.4s)]
*  to go across the country with the best bodyguard of all time who everyone wants to meet and love. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1047.52s)]
*  I mean, it's a little cowardly, but that's, yeah, I want to do that. So the motives are all, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1056.56s)]
*  you know, they're everywhere. I did think, like if you had been traveling with someone who [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1063.6s)]
*  wasn't recognizable, there would have been, I assume, a lot more anonymity. Traveling around [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1068.24s)]
*  Will Ferrell, you know, isn't exactly an unmediated experience. Did you feel like there was any [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1074.24s)]
*  tension in that idea at all for you? No, it's hard to say. Probably not because [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1080.72s)]
*  I've been around Will for 30 years, you know? And so that part felt comfortable. I know, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1088.4s)]
*  I don't, I didn't see any of the negative side effects except for obviously, you know, we show [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1094.96s)]
*  in the film a few places where social media is responding to us and they wouldn't respond to me [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1100.0800000000002s)]
*  and some other non-celebrity friend of mine at all. You know, they wouldn't, that wouldn't come up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1105.92s)]
*  They've got, Will is putting a spotlight on this whole thing. So you've got people calling me the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  wonderful, the best possible names that they can come up with there in their basements [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  because they don't have any time to do anything else constructive. Whatever. I love them all. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1122.24s)]
*  So there's one scene in particular in the film that takes place at a steakhouse in Amarillo, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1132.4s)]
*  Texas. That's the one you just referred to where, you know, after I think people were [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1139.2s)]
*  saying some pretty nasty things on social media. And so that scene happens and you know, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1143.36s)]
*  it's an upsetting experience. And then in the car after Will, you say you felt like you let [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  Harper down. Can you sort of unpack that a little bit for me? Let her down in the sense that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1153.84s)]
*  you weren't able to diffuse the tension in that moment or that you invited that moment at all? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think both of those, you know, didn't really have a grasp on how intense it was going [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1168.24s)]
*  to be. And yeah, I felt like we just didn't, yeah, we didn't do our due diligence and we found [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1177.52s)]
*  ourselves in this situation that felt like it was going to be just this benign kind of, you know, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1191.04s)]
*  place where you eat a big steak in the amount of time. And then you walk in and it's a thousand [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1204.0s)]
*  people seated in this room. And I was like, oh, why are we here? Also just to paint the picture [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1210.08s)]
*  for people. You were dressed as Sherlock Holmes. Yeah. And I exactly, I'm like, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1220.72s)]
*  that was a bad choice too. I thought it was going to be so fun. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you think the people in the restaurant thought you were making fun of them somehow? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1235.92s)]
*  Like that you had turned the thing into a spectacle? Like why were the vibes so off there? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1240.64s)]
*  Uh, well, you're up, you know, you're just up on this raised platform. And I mean, the vibes were [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1246.48s)]
*  just so off, uh, because to put it bluntly, there was a trans woman sitting next to Sherlock Holmes. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  Two year earlier question, I would say that was a moment where the Will Ferrell factor actually [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1267.6s)]
*  worked against me because that was a fish bowl. And the room was really zeroing in on a lot of [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1274.56s)]
*  photographs, a lot of selfies, a lot of, and, um, and, and I was sitting up there on a sort of on [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1283.3600000000001s)]
*  display and, um, here I'll say something that wasn't in the doc. Um, we'd gave a little toast [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1290.24s)]
*  and, um, it was funny. And, um, uh, I said something about passing a trans bill and the room [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1298.96s)]
*  did a kind of reversal and a little bit of a boo and I pulled myself out of it and a woman shouted [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  out, we still love you. And, um, I hate the phrase. I could be misinterpreting this woman completely, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1312.8000000000002s)]
*  but this is the feeling I had in the room, but it felt condescending for sure. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1322.88s)]
*  It, the still is the conditional. You still love me. When I finally give up being trans and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1326.8s)]
*  give my life over to Christ, then I'm worthy of, then they will love me more and I will have hit [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1335.6s)]
*  the bed, but they still love me even though I'm, uh, uh, some kind of a sinner or something. I felt [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1343.52s)]
*  that. And, and I, I, I think I kind of wished I'd walked in and said, oh no, this is going to be [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1349.44s)]
*  terrible. Let's just go. Why are, why are we here? Now we both kind of stuck it out because, you know, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1357.76s)]
*  I guess it's the function of having cameras there and we're making this thing. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1366.72s)]
*  And this was one of the places we were talked about going. So we need to follow through. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1371.04s)]
*  And it leads to one of the more compelling sections of, of the piece. But yeah, that's, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1375.68s)]
*  I think that I was just feeling that remorse and guilt of, of, of even going there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1383.68s)]
*  I want to go back to another moment in the film that, um, I don't know if tense is the right word, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1390.56s)]
*  but it's sort of the implications of it were interesting. It's so you guys go to a, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1396.8s)]
*  an Indiana Pacers game. Yes. You have court side seats and during the game, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  or I don't know if it's after the game, but while you're at the game, the governor Holcomb of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  Indiana comes up to you and basically does a little photo op. And then after the game, I guess it's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1412.32s)]
*  the next day or something. You guys are trying to figure out what his stance on trans issues were. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1418.48s)]
*  And it turns out he doesn't have the most progressive stance on them. And, and you know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1424.24s)]
*  it sort of feels in the, in the film, like, you know, you guys are wondering whether you should [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1429.12s)]
*  have taken the photo if there was a missed opportunity in some sense to not raise something [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1434.9599999999998s)]
*  with him. Um, did you think about like trying to go back to him or, or trying to talk to [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1439.6s)]
*  state politicians or it didn't necessarily have to be like a one and done, right? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1445.6799999999998s)]
*  I guess it didn't know that way. Yeah, it didn't come up. It would have been interesting. I'm sure. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1450.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been interesting. It would have been a little more confrontational than we [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1455.52s)]
*  had planned. Um, but yeah, that, that, that maybe we can go back for part two. I, I think what we [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1461.1200000000001s)]
*  both, what I felt there maybe even more than will, because we'll guess it all the time is a little [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1468.0s)]
*  bit of an ambushing. Sometimes at SNL, you'd be walking through the hall. And I remember walking [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1472.88s)]
*  to the hall and Donald Rumsfeld was there and he stuck his hand out and I shook his hand and I was [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1478.4s)]
*  like, Oh, I don't think I like you. What happened? Another thing that we didn't include in the doc [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1483.2s)]
*  at all is how lovely and supportive Rick Carlisle was the coach of the Pacers. Cause we have all [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1491.52s)]
*  this, we meet everyone kind of before the game starts and he literally pulled you aside and was [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1502.8s)]
*  like, congratulations. Like this is great. I wish you the best and congrats. Like he couldn't have [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1508.48s)]
*  been sweeter. He couldn't have been. That could have been what the governor said. That would have [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1512.8s)]
*  been neat. Yeah. The governor did not quite say that. No. And in your heart of hearts, do you have [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1516.8s)]
*  like a goal for the movie? Do you want it to change people's feelings or make them rethink their [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1523.2s)]
*  politics? Yeah. Sure. I think that's, I think that's in the end, that's why we did it. It's a funny [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1531.04s)]
*  movie. Will is a funny guy. And you know, when he asked me to do the project, he was very clear. I [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1539.36s)]
*  don't want to operate, make an opportunity out of our friendship. On the other end of that, I did [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1547.28s)]
*  want to make an opportunity out of my friendship. I want to be very clear about something though, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1552.7199999999998s)]
*  that I get in trouble with, I think with myself personally is there's a process of normalizing [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1558.7199999999998s)]
*  queer people for America. And this movie does that. It makes the trans experience more [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1566.72s)]
*  understandable. It's in a language, a comedy language that they know from Will and me. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1573.04s)]
*  It's a good project. It's representation in a good way. However, to be quite honest, I'm not [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1578.48s)]
*  that interested in normalizing for people who have hated me for centuries. I don't want to sound mean, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1585.44s)]
*  but I do want the movie to do that work. I want it to make other people be gentler and softer [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1595.2s)]
*  and caring. And maybe if you're a father who loved Anchorman, and you've got a trans kid, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1601.2s)]
*  now maybe you're going to open yourself up to this. It's not a closed off future. There's a bright [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1608.0s)]
*  future ahead of you. I happen to think it's a better future. But I think that's the work I want [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1614.4s)]
*  the movie to do. I don't necessarily care as much about it. The conversation is too tricky for me, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1620.56s)]
*  quite honestly, but I don't particularly care about making myself normal to people who don't like me. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1628.8799999999999s)]
*  Near the end of the film, this is not a spoiler in any way, although I don't think the movie is a [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1639.2s)]
*  spoiler type of film. We get to California, the card doesn't break down. Spoiler. We discover oil [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1643.9199999999998s)]
*  though. We discover oil in Beverly Hills. But you say towards the end of the film, Harper, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1650.32s)]
*  I think the way you put it is you should have transitioned 40 years ago, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1657.84s)]
*  but if you had, none of your life would have happened the same way. Which is a very [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  profoundly ambivalent emotion. And I'm just wondering if you could talk through it with me [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1667.52s)]
*  a little bit more. How do you think about those two facets? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1674.08s)]
*  That's an ever fluid situation. I land on the side of good fortune of being able to come to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  this transition when I was 59. But, of course, there's a lot going on there. If one, if I [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1688.0s)]
*  transitioned when I was 20, my life would have been probably different, maybe wonderful, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1701.44s)]
*  but probably tough. I don't think I would have gotten the opportunity to get a comedy job at [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1708.24s)]
*  Saturday Night Live eventually. I think I would have been looked a little more on as [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  an outlier, as a human. But if I had transitioned into an environment like today 40 years ago, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1722.96s)]
*  yeah, I mean, of course. Of course, I would have wanted to start my hormonal treatment at 16. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1729.36s)]
*  Yes, there are mornings where I wake up. Or when I see young trans people today [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1739.6799999999998s)]
*  and how easily they walk through the world, not everywhere, but in the coastal cities or something, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  there's a kind of jealousness there. Like, oh, that would have been wonderful. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1752.56s)]
*  Well, this is purely constructive criticism. In the film, you got this hankering for Dunkin' Donuts. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1759.36s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1768.32s)]
*  You keep pestering your friend about who's going through this emotional cutting to the core [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1768.96s)]
*  experience. And you just fixate on you want your Dunkin' Donuts. It's insensitive. Just something [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1776.72s)]
*  for you to think about. Well, can you answer that? Why don't you walk in my shoes for a little while? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1785.44s)]
*  You're on this trip. You've been nothing but accommodating to your friend. You've gone [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1793.76s)]
*  everywhere she wanted to go. You've done everything. Like, you've barely done anything you wanted to do [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1800.0s)]
*  at all. And the one thing you wanted was Dunkin' Donuts. I mean, I don't know. I think it was a [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1804.88s)]
*  small complaint on the scale of everything. She got to go through an experience and then [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1814.72s)]
*  I literally wanted one thing. Pathetic. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1822.96s)]
*  They are tasty donuts. I want one now. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1825.68s)]
*  Not the one I got when we finally got it. It was cold. It wasn't even room temperature. It was like [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1828.32s)]
*  cold, a cold, weird donut. You know, there's a lesson in there. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1834.32s)]
*  There is. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1838.88s)]
*  So you guys finished filming last year at some point? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1844.72s)]
*  I guess. I don't. Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  But Harper, how are you feeling now about being out in the world as a woman? Do you feel different [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  than even a year ago? I feel ecstatic. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1858.16s)]
*  I feel ecstatic. I mean, I don't. Look, there's stressors in life. My kids making money. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1863.52s)]
*  You know, things that are still there. There's still anxieties. There's still some mornings [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1870.96s)]
*  where you wake up and go, oh, shit, I got to do that. But I basically wake up every morning happy, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1875.3600000000001s)]
*  which is something I didn't do for, I don't know, mostly 59 years. I feel amazing. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1882.88s)]
*  After the break, the lines around comedy can be fuzzy though. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1895.84s)]
*  Comedy can be fuzzy these days, even to the ones thinking most deeply about them. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1899.84s)]
*  I walked away from that first interview saying, did I just defend drag as comedy [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  from a straight, cis white male? Did I just defend that? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1910.72s)]
*  This is the interview. I'm David Marchese. Harper, are you here? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1929.84s)]
*  There she is. I am. Hello? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1941.12s)]
*  Hi, Harper. Ta-da. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you not see me? I do now. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1945.04s)]
*  Harper, you had said that when I was asking about the Saturday Night Live experience and if it was [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1950.9599999999998s)]
*  fraught in any way, the way you put it, which I thought was really sharp, was that if you look [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1957.12s)]
*  in a comedy writer's room, you're looking at a room full of people hiding things or disassociating. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1962.32s)]
*  Now that you are no longer hiding something that's so central, has your comedy writing changed? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1969.1999999999998s)]
*  Weirdly, I don't think as much as people might think. I think my feeling about being around [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1979.12s)]
*  people has changed radically. Obviously, my satirical pen is aimed at different things. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1986.24s)]
*  For lack of a better word, without a doubt, I've become more woke. But I think comedy has in [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=1995.36s)]
*  general, not always. I'm in a comedy room right now and it's a radically different experience [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2001.68s)]
*  than a comedy room, say, when I started at the John Stewart show. It's not as aggressive, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2011.04s)]
*  it's definitely not as male. It's got diversity going on. So that's a change for the better, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2018.08s)]
*  100%. I don't know if that's me becoming different or me feeling welcome in this environment, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2026.8s)]
*  which I didn't feel welcome at the John Stewart show, whether I thought so or not. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2036.48s)]
*  I've said it before, you could be a woman in a late night comedy room. There were very few [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2041.6s)]
*  when I started, but it still was a boy's room, no matter what. So that's changed. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2049.52s)]
*  What you just said about how your writing has maybe gotten more woke connects to something else [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2057.6s)]
*  you had said earlier. The way you put it was that you wonder sometimes about whether being woke [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2063.6s)]
*  means we might sometimes take away the joy of play for comedians or take away some of the range that [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2069.68s)]
*  comedians have. Do you have any sense of how we're supposed to draw lines between calling out stuff [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2076.48s)]
*  that is harmful and also allowing comedians to play around with subjects? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2084.3199999999997s)]
*  You dirty bastard. The answer is nope. That's the quick answer. But yeah, I walked away from [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2092.16s)]
*  that first interview saying, did I just defend drag as comedy from a straight, cis, white male? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  Did I just defend that? And I was like, I don't know if I did or didn't. It was pretty vague, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2107.12s)]
*  I hope. I think it was, I would say ambivalent. I hope at the very least it was ambivalent. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2113.04s)]
*  My short answer to that question is always no, I wouldn't write it again and I don't think it's [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2120.8799999999997s)]
*  right. But I'm just going to be honest, I can't answer all these questions in my present state. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2125.2s)]
*  My career, where my sweet spot is and where I enjoy it the most is creating silly, funny characters. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2132.0s)]
*  And that's my favorite kind of comedy. And generally, I think that's Will's sweet spot too. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2139.8399999999997s)]
*  And I have always thought punching down was wrong. What I have been discovering, like most of us, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2145.36s)]
*  is that we were punching down sometimes when we didn't think we were. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2154.48s)]
*  Yeah. One of the things I was wondering was whether there was any apprehension on your part, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2159.44s)]
*  Will, about making your private life or your personal life into a documentary. Because I [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2167.04s)]
*  don't really, you're not a confessional comedian. I don't think of your comedy as you're working out [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2176.48s)]
*  your stuff on film. Was that like sort of a little hurdle for you? It definitely, it occurred to me, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2182.32s)]
*  oh, okay, this will be an audience will be seeing a different, having more of an insight into who I [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2191.68s)]
*  am and getting to see me on more of a day to day kind of existence. And no, I think I've done, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2198.64s)]
*  I've had a long enough career at this point that I'm very secure in exploring the subject matter [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2211.68s)]
*  with my friend. And I know there could be, I don't know, we'll see what the reaction is towards me. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2218.0s)]
*  And it's going to be some is positive, some is going to be negative or whatever. But I'm at a [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2226.16s)]
*  place where I can take any of it. Harper, there was something you said that it stuck with me, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2230.88s)]
*  which was that you don't care so much about making yourself normal to people. And to me, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2238.64s)]
*  that sounds clearly like sort of an emotionally necessary place to get to, but also a very hard [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2245.6s)]
*  thing to actually achieve. This is a big question, but like, how did you get there? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2251.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think I'm quite there. I mean, I think it's, you know, if I walk into a particularly [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2259.2s)]
*  what I'm perceiving as a particularly male space, I still am self conscious about who I am and [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2266.7999999999997s)]
*  how I'm dressed. I think when I started this process, I was looking in a lot of forums, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2274.7999999999997s)]
*  and the goal was to pass as a woman. But I can't pass. And I'm also not going to change my voice. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2283.44s)]
*  I think some trans women, especially older ones find this odd, you know, but I'm like, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2292.7999999999997s)]
*  if I was breaking down my classification, I would say, I'm a human being, and then I am a trans [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2301.44s)]
*  person. And then I like to be identified as a trans woman. So I think I'm trans first. And I [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2310.08s)]
*  feel like that's the thing that's been inside me, not that necessarily that I needed to be a woman. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2316.96s)]
*  I just am very happy to be trans. And the longer I walk through the world that way, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2325.36s)]
*  yes, it makes me feel better or just more myself. When you say normal or not normal, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2332.4s)]
*  being trans is normal. You know, I almost wanted to ask you the first time we talked, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2340.48s)]
*  it's a question I think, I feel like I need to ask reporters before they ask me, do you believe [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2346.48s)]
*  trans people exist? Well, can I tell you Harper then that I do believe trans people exist? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2352.72s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much. It's just the thing that, you know, you go into an interview, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  you don't know, especially the ones asking skeptical questions, like how did you start [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2364.8799999999997s)]
*  feeling this way? Or why do you think you're a woman? You know, and it's like, some of these [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2370.0s)]
*  things can't be explained to cis people. And they get very frustrated by that. They just do. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2374.16s)]
*  There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer those kinds of questions. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2379.6s)]
*  Can you share with me the last thing that the other one did that really made you laugh? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2386.8s)]
*  I mean, I laugh every time I'm around Will. There's just no limit to what he will challenge [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2391.92s)]
*  himself to do. Real quickly, I'll go back because I do think you have to imagine when Will said, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2399.84s)]
*  let's do this project. Like all of our projects, there is a little bit of us going like, yeah, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2407.44s)]
*  that's fucking nuts. Like, that's the part that both of us love. Yeah. I think we're both drawn [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2413.28s)]
*  to holding our hand over the flame for as long as we can. And not that, and for some people, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
*  that means controversial. Not to us. It just means how silly can we be and not explain it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2430.0s)]
*  My last year on the show, we would just have blue note cards of just broad sketch ideas. And every [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2439.76s)]
*  week or every other week, they'd be like, Harper, you have to write a sketch called Taco Time. Go. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2448.4s)]
*  And there was this sketch I wrote called the Old Prospector. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2455.04s)]
*  But no. I remember Old Prospector. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2459.52s)]
*  I just saw it recently. I was like, this is madness. And I'm really just trying to make Harper laugh. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2462.64s)]
*  You're forgetting a key element that speaks to this perfectly. Like Taco Town is a perfect example, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2470.88s)]
*  or Unicorn Mountain. You don't know what these sketches are, by the way, for good reason. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2478.16s)]
*  I would write the first half and then hand it to Will, and I wasn't allowed to see it. So I don't [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2483.04s)]
*  know what he's going to do with the sketch. It was always a left turn, too. David, sorry. Just for [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2491.6000000000004s)]
*  our benefit, I just want to describe to you what Unicorn Mountain was about. Please. Yeah. Unicorn [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2496.96s)]
*  Mountain was a three-page song that led off the sketch. And it was all about, it basically set [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  the premise of being a children's show. It's Unicorn Mountain, where unicorns live in unity [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2508.72s)]
*  and harmony, and they bring joy, and they're magical, and they're fun. And let's all go to [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2514.8799999999997s)]
*  Unicorn Mountain. And then we open on myself and Tracy Morgan and maybe, I forget who else. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2519.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is Harper's half. And we're eating a unicorn. And we're talking about how delicious [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2525.8399999999997s)]
*  the unicorn was and how easy it was to trap it and kill it because it was so benevolent and sweet [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2535.12s)]
*  and kind. And I felt a little bit bad when we killed it, but God, this is good unicorn. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2541.52s)]
*  And now that's Unicorn Mountain. Yeah. So there's, I think I can detect a through line from [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2546.96s)]
*  the answers you gave to the film you just made. You know, you're on some level, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2554.72s)]
*  just trying to make the other guy laugh. Oh, for sure. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2559.8399999999997s)]
*  Guy or girl? Say that again? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2565.2799999999997s)]
*  Make the other girl or guy laugh. Yes, I'm sorry. Sorry. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  Don't worry. Sorry. It's a verbal tick I have that I need to solve. But you know, it's like I have [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2573.6s)]
*  two daughters. I say like, come over here, guys. You know, I apologize. Please don't worry about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  that. I say guys all the time. Dudes, bros, those are a little bit more transgressive. But guys is [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2585.52s)]
*  something I mean, I say it to my kids and they're all girls. They look what happened. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2590.64s)]
*  Do you love my girl? Want him today then. So here we go. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2596.24s)]
*  It's a universal experience. Yes. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2600.48s)]
*  So the movie really paints this lovely picture of your friendship as continued support and [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2604.24s)]
*  closeness. But there must be some way in which this experience has changed your friendship, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2612.3199999999997s)]
*  because all friendships change over time, I think. And, you know, change isn't always easy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2618.16s)]
*  Has anything about sort of your shared experience challenged or evolved your ideas about what [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2624.3999999999996s)]
*  friendship is or what it can be? I think a lot of my friendships, there was an element of fear. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2630.56s)]
*  And the biggest change for me is that I'm not afraid of my friends. And I think that's pretty [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2638.08s)]
*  huge. So for someone who's hiding something like I was transitioning can open up a world that [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2643.6s)]
*  I just didn't live in. That was a big change for me. I mean, it brought us closer for sure. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2653.12s)]
*  There's no question for the entire time that we've known each other. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2659.44s)]
*  We never talked as deeply or intensely as we did those 17 days. So that's without a doubt, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2663.6s)]
*  a change there. I mean, we're about to go through an intense period of press, of reflection, of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2675.52s)]
*  analysis over all this stuff. And at the end, maybe Harper and Michael, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2687.12s)]
*  I hate you. Now I hate you for dragging me through all this. We are no longer friends, which [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2693.52s)]
*  my comedy brain says, at the end of this, we should announce we're no longer friends. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  I agree. I mean, I don't think it's a maybe. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2708.24s)]
*  That's Will Ferrell and Harper Steele. Will and Harper will be in select theaters starting [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TihbpA2LZ0&t=2710.4s)]
