# Jonathan Roumie on Faith, Surrender and Playing Jesus on TV
**New York Times - The Interview:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM)
*  The hour is coming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not always easy playing Jesus Christ. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2.64s)]
*  Just ask Jonathan Rumi. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Since 2017, Rumi has been the star of the global hit series The Chosen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=8.58s)]
*  The series takes a prestige TV approach to the story of Jesus. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  It's full of sharp dialogue. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=16.9s)]
*  You're losing something. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Interpersonal drama, unexpected humor, and high production values. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=20.18s)]
*  That's slickly appealing modern interpretation, centered on Rumi's warm and relatable portrayal, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  has helped the show to become a massive success. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=29.98s)]
*  It's been watched by more than 250 million people and will return for its fifth season [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  under creator Dallas Jenkins next year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=38.22s)]
*  Rumi and I talked about how his Catholicism influences his portrayal of Jesus. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=41.34s)]
*  I feel that it lends an authenticity to the role. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=45.22s)]
*  The pressures of living up to his fans' expectations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=49.5s)]
*  People yell out, Jesus. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  And what he sees as a worrisome retreat from religion in American life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=54.3s)]
*  Society at large has banished it from visible culture. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=58.14s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=62.34s)]
*  Here's my interview with Jonathan Rumi. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=63.94s)]
*  So you've been playing Jesus on The Chosen for five seasons now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=74.58s)]
*  What sort of conversations did you and Dallas have initially about the kind of Jesus that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=80.42s)]
*  you wanted to show? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=88.06s)]
*  Because your Jesus is a very different portrayal than Jim Caviezel's Jesus in The Passion [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=89.26s)]
*  of the Christ or Willem Dafoe's in The Last Temptation of Christ. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=96.66s)]
*  Or you know what else is a good one but also very different than yours is Max von Sydow. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  The greatest story ever told. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  What all those Jesuses or Jeezy, I don't know what they are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=111.1s)]
*  They to me feel of a piece. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=116.74s)]
*  There's a solemnity to them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  And your Jesus is a much more, in some ways, contemporary feeling Jesus. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=121.82s)]
*  I think what makes it feel like that, that we have that all those other portrayals didn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  to was the format of time in long form storytelling to build characters and build relationships [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=137.3s)]
*  over episodes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=145.78s)]
*  You're seeing the nuances of his character, his quirks, the things that nobody's ever [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=147.22s)]
*  taken the time to explore are the humanity of these characters, the day to day of these [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  characters. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  And so if you believe they existed, and I do, they were human beings. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  So theology aside, nobody's ever explored that humanity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=165.22s)]
*  Nobody's ever wondered what it would be like to crack a joke with Jesus, to have a glass [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=170.22s)]
*  of wine with Jesus, to see him dancing at a wedding. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=175.14s)]
*  Because if you're human, laughing and joking and frustration and the entire spectrum of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=178.32s)]
*  emotions are part of the human process, part of the human journey, part of the struggle. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=185.5s)]
*  He went through all of these things that we do so that we would have somebody to relate [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=191.26s)]
*  to as we're going through these trials ourselves. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Did you have any apprehension about showing a version of Jesus that isn't one that's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  typically shown? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=206.66s)]
*  I didn't, because I think he has to feel human. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=207.66s)]
*  If he doesn't feel human, most people won't relate to him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=212.14s)]
*  I mean, granted, there might be scenarios from time to time where I've, you know, I, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=216.14s)]
*  and I've shared this with Dallas where he and I may not have exactly alignment on like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=223.22s)]
*  like, well, I feel like if he says it like this, it's just a little too casual, you know? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  And he then may come back to me and say, yeah, but here's why. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=236.14s)]
*  And then he goes through it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I get that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm just in my head, I was thinking of that sort of cliche of an actor saying, oh, what's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=244.86s)]
*  my motivation? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=248.9s)]
*  In your case, the answer was, you gotta bring about the salvation of the world. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=249.9s)]
*  Play it like that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=254.06s)]
*  Save them souls. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=255.06s)]
*  They gotta save more souls. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=256.06s)]
*  And so the decision was made that you were going to do The Chosen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=257.98s)]
*  Before that, maybe scuffling is too strong of a word, but you were just sort of a jobbing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  actor. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=267.5s)]
*  Struggle-busting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=268.5s)]
*  Struggle-busting. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=269.5s)]
*  A struggle-busting actor makes it big playing Jesus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=270.5s)]
*  I think that the path to that is absolute and uncompromising, surrendering to a higher [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=275.26s)]
*  power, things that are beyond my control. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=284.14s)]
*  Because that's what it took, I believe, for me to get to the place where I was ready for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=289.1s)]
*  an opportunity like this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=296.14s)]
*  I had moved to LA and then I struggled for eight years in Los Angeles, only to realize [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=298.5s)]
*  that I was trying so hard to control my life, to control my destiny, to do the things that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=304.9s)]
*  I thought needed to be done to have a successful career as an actor. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  And they weren't working. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=317.9s)]
*  I was on government assistance. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=319.17999999999995s)]
*  That ran out. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  I woke up completely broke one morning six and a half years ago. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  And I was literally in, it was just, I didn't see any way out that I could figure out how [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=327.1s)]
*  to make work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=333.74s)]
*  And so I literally said, God, you take this from me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  It's in your hands now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=341.54s)]
*  It's not up to me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=342.54s)]
*  And I'm not going to worry about it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  And I was relieved because I really felt now it wasn't my choice. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=346.22s)]
*  And then three months later, the chosen comes along. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=350.02s)]
*  And I thought, okay, I just needed to submit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  I know that you're practicing Catholic. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  What does your faith allow you to give to the role that a non-believer or a non-Catholic [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=359.14s)]
*  might not be able to give? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=369.62s)]
*  I feel that it lends an authenticity to the role that allows me to understand more of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  why Jesus did the things he did and said the things he did than somebody who is completely [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=380.34s)]
*  unfamiliar. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think I struggled to follow Jesus like anybody else who considers themselves a Christian. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  But the struggle is part of it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=396.02s)]
*  And I think God knows what we struggle with. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=399.34s)]
*  But we're still challenged to do what he would do in those situations. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=404.42s)]
*  And I think because I actually believe that, that seems to have lent me a kind of credibility [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=409.7s)]
*  and an authenticity in approaching the character that maybe people haven't seen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=416.3s)]
*  You know, it's interesting because you're saying that who you are allows you to play [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=422.38s)]
*  the role of Jesus with a particular authenticity. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=430.14s)]
*  Do you feel that someone who is a non-believer could credibly and authentically play that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=433.22s)]
*  part? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=439.26000000000005s)]
*  I think they could. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=440.26000000000005s)]
*  I think if they had a real understanding of what he represented and why he was so much [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=441.26000000000005s)]
*  of a revolutionary to his time and even today, I think they could. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=448.82000000000005s)]
*  You'd have to, I mean, in layman's terms, you'd have to do your research and drop into [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=453.5s)]
*  the character and, you know, go Daniel Day-Lewis on it and for three months, you know, go live [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=457.42s)]
*  as a rabbi in a kibbutz or something like that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=461.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=465.0s)]
*  But I think with a character like Jesus, I think a lot of people do sort of reduce him [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  to a really great teacher, cool guy, you know, shared a lot. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=470.8s)]
*  He becomes a sandaled hippie in a lot of people's minds. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  They're like, oh, you know, he said some cool stuff and he did some cool things. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=479.56s)]
*  And it's like, I think he was a little more than that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=483.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=485.72s)]
*  He came to be a sword. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=486.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=487.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=488.72s)]
*  I would watch videos of you giving talks for crowds. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  You come out and very often it seems a wave of applause, like really like an overwhelming [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=496.68s)]
*  response. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  And the idea that you're getting that sort of attention combined with the fact that you're [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=507.24s)]
*  getting it for playing Jesus strikes me as a potentially psychologically and spiritually [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=518.4s)]
*  combustible situation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=530.76s)]
*  Does it feel that way to you? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  No, because I recognize that none of this is about me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=535.0s)]
*  I don't matter in the grand scheme of things. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  And so I recognize that when I come out to those speeches and people react the way they [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=542.84s)]
*  do and people yell out, Jesus, you know, that they're seeing me as the face of the guy that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=548.64s)]
*  they've had this response to this reaction to while experiencing the show. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  And I'm the closest thing to the real Jesus that they probably will ever see in person. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=561.64s)]
*  And so I think psychologically they know I'm not Jesus, but they feel they want me [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=568.02s)]
*  to be the next best thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=574.02s)]
*  Of course, I cannot go anywhere near that reality. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=576.98s)]
*  But that said, if I believe everything I believe about my faith, I'm in this position for a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=582.06s)]
*  reason. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=590.18s)]
*  I was cast as Jesus and somebody else wasn't. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=592.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=595.3s)]
*  God only knows why. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=596.3s)]
*  You're saying essentially that you become a human icon for people. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=597.9000000000001s)]
*  The thing that I don't quite understand is how you separate the idea that, as you said, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  like, you're nothing here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=610.26s)]
*  You don't matter. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=613.46s)]
*  Dust in the wind. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=614.46s)]
*  But then also with what you said about feeling like you've been put here for a reason, that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=615.46s)]
*  you're saying there is something special about you. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=622.9000000000001s)]
*  Those seem to me like somewhat contradictory ideas. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=626.78s)]
*  How do you reconcile them? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=629.62s)]
*  And then also, there's never some small part of you that's like, oh, I am special. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  There's people liking me because I'm special. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=637.38s)]
*  And that means that I matter in some way. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=640.06s)]
*  None of that little sort of ego gratification temptation ever creeps into your head. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  I think if I said there wasn't anything at all, I'd be lying. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=647.6999999999999s)]
*  Do I allow it to become my reason for doing what I do? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=650.6999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=655.18s)]
*  The paradox that you're describing, I guess it is kind of hard to make that distinction. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=656.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes, there's for me a sense of mission. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=661.9799999999999s)]
*  But the mission is about Jesus, in this case with the Chosens, about God. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  That's what this experience is in playing this role when I meet fans who come out. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=670.5s)]
*  And I was just in the Philippines. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  And it was nuts, man. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=679.18s)]
*  Like I've never seen anything like it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=680.9799999999999s)]
*  They were tremendous. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=683.14s)]
*  They're just so intense. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=684.9399999999999s)]
*  And everywhere I go, they're like giving me stuff and little articles and notes and things like that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=686.3s)]
*  So I'm playing this character that people, for the most part, they already love him. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=692.38s)]
*  They have a relationship with him. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=699.38s)]
*  And then I come in and I sort of fulfill their idea of who that person is to them in their life. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=701.18s)]
*  And I'm also one of them in that I have a relationship. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=709.58s)]
*  And a lot of them know that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=714.1s)]
*  And a lot of fans know how I feel about Jesus and God and faith and all of those things. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=715.5s)]
*  And so I think all of that combined, I think it's the reason for my career. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=722.58s)]
*  So you go to these events and like you described, thousands of people are cheering and are coming [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=728.7s)]
*  up to you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=737.3000000000001s)]
*  And you also are asked to come and speak at things like the National Eucharistic Congress. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=738.3s)]
*  Or you gave a commencement address at the Catholic University of America. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=747.42s)]
*  You spoke at the March for Life in Washington last year. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=751.54s)]
*  These sort of demands on your time and on your being. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  Are they ever exhausting in any sense? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=762.3399999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like you're being asked to give maybe more than you have to give? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=765.5799999999999s)]
*  It can be draining. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=770.9s)]
*  The rigors of travel alone. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=774.06s)]
*  But then human interaction. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=775.9399999999999s)]
*  If I'm meeting you at one of these events and something has moved you to want to come [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=778.42s)]
*  and have this individual moment that oftentimes happens at some of these things where they'll [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  have like VIP groups that have, you know, there are certain people that get to have [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=789.14s)]
*  some one-on-one time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  But there's 700 of them. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=796.86s)]
*  That takes time and it takes energy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=799.66s)]
*  And a lot of the times it's emotionally charged. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  And you know, better or worse, that catches up with you after 700 encounters. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=807.54s)]
*  Was there a particularly difficult encounter that comes to mind? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=814.06s)]
*  I was at a conference in a stadium of about 40,000 people. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=819.3s)]
*  And I came off the stage and shortly thereafter I got to the little green room where they [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=827.02s)]
*  had us hanging out. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=834.5799999999999s)]
*  And security comes into the room and says, hey, there's a lady outside who's got a child [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=837.38s)]
*  in a wheelchair. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=844.6999999999999s)]
*  Is it okay? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=846.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if she can say hello. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=847.58s)]
*  And I came outside and I met the lady and her son and she was already overwhelmed. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=849.1800000000001s)]
*  And she then went on to tell me, she said, you know, our favorite episode is the episode [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=857.7800000000001s)]
*  where Tamar, one of the characters, lets her friend down on a stretcher in through the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=862.86s)]
*  roof of Zebedee's house and Jesus heals him and he can walk again. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=868.6600000000001s)]
*  And she says, so I just thought, wouldn't it be great if the same thing happened to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=876.26s)]
*  my son? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=881.86s)]
*  And I said, yeah, that would be amazing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=883.3s)]
*  But I got to be honest with you. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=897.14s)]
*  As far as I know, I don't have that gift, but I would love to pray with you if that's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=901.2199999999999s)]
*  okay. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=908.1s)]
*  I said, would that be all right? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=909.1s)]
*  She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=912.3399999999999s)]
*  So I just sat there with them. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=914.4599999999999s)]
*  I stood with them and I prayed with them for a minute and they were so gracious and thanked [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=915.9399999999999s)]
*  me and I walked away and then I just burst into tears. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=920.9s)]
*  I thought to myself, man, on some level, I must have let them down, but they know what [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=927.54s)]
*  I do. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=937.54s)]
*  They know I'm not a healer. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=938.54s)]
*  I'm not a preacher. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=940.18s)]
*  So once I got through that line of thought, I recognized that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=941.58s)]
*  I said, okay, I can't be what she maybe wanted me to be. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=946.9399999999999s)]
*  I can only be who I've been made to be. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=953.02s)]
*  There's a way in which experiences like that call to mind for me a kind of, you could almost [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=957.3s)]
*  call it like a category error about the position that you find yourself in, where you're an [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=968.3s)]
*  actor and because you play this role, you are put into positions that probably an actor [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=974.26s)]
*  shouldn't be put into. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=985.7s)]
*  It seems like increasingly you are becoming a figure of authority. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=988.1s)]
*  When you're asked by people to come talk to groups of Catholics, what do you think they [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=992.86s)]
*  want from you in that setting? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1000.18s)]
*  And is there a part of you that thinks like, I understand that you've been put here to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1004.0600000000001s)]
*  do something, but is there a part of you that thinks this is messed up? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1008.74s)]
*  I'm an actor. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1011.98s)]
*  Why ask me? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1013.38s)]
*  Ask a theologian. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1015.22s)]
*  Ask a priest. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1016.5s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1017.5s)]
*  I think the category error thing is kind of funny because I think all of us, all of us [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1020.38s)]
*  are not the sum total of what we do. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1028.22s)]
*  I think you by what you do as an interviewer and the questions that you ask people and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1032.5s)]
*  the things that you bring out of people shed light on humanity in ways that other people [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1037.7s)]
*  wouldn't know how to do. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1042.9s)]
*  And so in many ways, you have a gift for humanity that you might not even be considering in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1044.14s)]
*  that light. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1051.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1052.5s)]
*  I 100% agree with everything you just said. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1053.5s)]
*  No, but it's true. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1055.7800000000002s)]
*  But no, but it's absolutely true because we're not just, I don't think we're just meant to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1058.38s)]
*  be here to just eke out a living and get a job and maybe have a family, make some money [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1063.42s)]
*  and then die. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1072.38s)]
*  Like we have a conversation and something, some sort of fruit comes out of that for somebody [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1073.8200000000002s)]
*  else hearing this interview. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1079.3400000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the trajectory that they were on all of a sudden change changes and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1081.5s)]
*  then it changes for the better. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1087.1000000000001s)]
*  And then they're, they learned something or they had misconceptions about Christians or [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1088.42s)]
*  Catholics or, you know, non-Christians that they didn't before. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1093.66s)]
*  And now they, they have a better dialogue. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1097.66s)]
*  It's like, I don't give my political opinions out publicly. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1100.06s)]
*  Well, not quite true. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1103.6599999999999s)]
*  Not quite. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1104.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, talking at the March for Life. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1105.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, here's what I'll say about that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1106.98s)]
*  Which I should explain is a pro-life, also call it anti-abortion rally that happens every [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1109.94s)]
*  year in Washington. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1115.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1116.74s)]
*  And I was on the fence about speaking there because I recognize that for so many people, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1117.74s)]
*  it is only political. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1125.82s)]
*  For me, it is only spiritual. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1128.0s)]
*  Can you tease that out for me? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1131.4s)]
*  So if I come to a conference like the March for Life and they want me to share thoughts, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1133.22s)]
*  well, I'm thinking like, well, what do I believe as a Catholic? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1143.72s)]
*  I believe in the sanctity of life from the moment of conception. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1147.92s)]
*  as Catholics and Christians. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1153.36s)]
*  And so for me, it's a spiritual thing that has been usurped and turned into a political [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1158.0s)]
*  weapon that divides people in such a way where they no longer see the spirituality of the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1164.8999999999999s)]
*  issue. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1174.8s)]
*  It becomes completely about right or left, conservative or liberal. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1176.08s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1181.32s)]
*  So for me, that wasn't politics. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1183.36s)]
*  That was spirituality. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1186.36s)]
*  You can't cherry pick the aspects of your faith you like and dispense the things you [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1187.56s)]
*  don't like. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1195.2s)]
*  You said it yourself, I came not to bring peace, but to bring a sword. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1198.04s)]
*  Fathers will divide themselves against their sons, mothers and daughters. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1203.2s)]
*  Because of things like this, these kinds of issues that I think for Jesus, it's like, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1208.82s)]
*  if you're going to follow me, it's not going to be easy. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1214.58s)]
*  It's going to be really hard. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1217.98s)]
*  People will hate you. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1219.8999999999999s)]
*  Get used to it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1220.8999999999999s)]
*  Why is abortion the issue where you chose to make your voice public and not other things [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1223.86s)]
*  that are central to Jesus's teachings like in treatment of the poor, for example? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1229.98s)]
*  I mean, I do do that. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1236.54s)]
*  In fact, I was just in Tanzania and Rwanda visiting these children that I support and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1237.6599999999999s)]
*  their families, which I had been doing even before The Chosen. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1246.82s)]
*  A year before The Chosen, I found this charity called Unbound. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1251.6599999999999s)]
*  And I saw the work that they were doing and they were changing not just the children's [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1259.1399999999999s)]
*  lives through sponsorship, but entire families. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1264.26s)]
*  So I'm doing as much as I can. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1267.9s)]
*  And I weigh every opportunity that comes to me to speak on these things very carefully. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1273.6200000000001s)]
*  And I also know that there's only so much that I can give of myself. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1282.06s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1289.18s)]
*  I mean that it's a lot for me physically and emotionally. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1291.34s)]
*  It can get really, really taxing at times. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  And so I'm trying to do things like just take better care of myself and try to go on more [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1301.9399999999998s)]
*  vacations. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1308.22s)]
*  But it's hard to find time these days. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1310.1399999999999s)]
*  But you know, sleep when you're in the ground, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1312.22s)]
*  I realize you just made a comment about trying to find relaxations, peace of mind. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1316.06s)]
*  But I have another question about the march for life. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1321.98s)]
*  So there's one moment in the speech you gave there where you sort of pivot and say that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1325.62s)]
*  you know about the world of entertainment. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1334.94s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing all of this. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1336.98s)]
*  So if I'm misremembering, just correct me. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1338.62s)]
*  I'll help you. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1340.34s)]
*  It's super dark. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1341.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1342.34s)]
*  And you're sort of diagnosing the cultural landscape. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1343.34s)]
*  And you say there's just sort of an increase in occult imagery, depictions of witchcraft. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1346.1399999999999s)]
*  And you say some of this is even subliminal. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1356.58s)]
*  And you know it when you see it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1359.54s)]
*  I don't know exactly what you mean. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1360.78s)]
*  Can you give me examples of the kind of stuff you're talking about? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1363.78s)]
*  I think we've reached a point now in culture where seeing depictions and images and symbolism [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1367.86s)]
*  of Satan and Satanism and demons and witchcraft and the symbols that's related to all of the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1379.9399999999998s)]
*  occult are so frequent and regular that it's so easy to become desensitized. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1389.1399999999999s)]
*  I think your mind just filters it and goes, I've seen that so many times now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1396.6599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't even register. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1400.6999999999998s)]
*  And if you go back a couple of decades ago, you would never see anything like that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1403.3799999999999s)]
*  I've seen it more I think in the music industry. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1408.02s)]
*  Demonic imagery and music videos and immodesty and all of these things that the youngest [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1411.1s)]
*  of our society are subjected to and shouldn't be, I don't believe. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1419.6s)]
*  I think for me, remembering that speech, my heart was for the kids that see certain things [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1425.78s)]
*  like on music videos and then they reenact themselves or they wear what they're seeing [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1434.18s)]
*  because it's what's popular and fashionable and they don't have any idea that what they're [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1441.58s)]
*  like, some of the imagery or the symbols or the words that are being used are from a spiritual [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1451.8600000000001s)]
*  standpoint really, really damaging and really dangerous on a level that we've never seen before. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1458.74s)]
*  You know, it's funny because I said I don't see it and of course, it's like, I enjoy the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1466.42s)]
*  music of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1471.5s)]
*  I'm a huge Iron Maiden fan. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1473.42s)]
*  Iron Maiden. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1475.46s)]
*  A member of the beast. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1476.46s)]
*  I'm like, well, I can't wear that t-shirt so much anymore. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1477.6200000000001s)]
*  But to me, that kind of imagery, it feels benign to me. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1483.7s)]
*  It's on the same level as science fiction movies or horror films. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1490.74s)]
*  This is entertainment. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1495.66s)]
*  So my question for you is- [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1496.78s)]
*  We're also referencing that, like rock and the imagery from those bands in that time [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1497.78s)]
*  are different than some of the more modern. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1507.46s)]
*  I think it's much more graphic and sexualized. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1513.22s)]
*  Like, sexuality is so much more prevalent in the media, especially in music. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1516.42s)]
*  The display of sexuality and the dark images connected to sexuality are so much more blatant [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1524.06s)]
*  than they ever were 30, 40 years ago. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1530.6599999999999s)]
*  But do you think the kind of iconography you're talking about is just sort of the natural [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1533.06s)]
*  outcome of a corroded culture or do you think it's the intentional result of darker forces? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1539.82s)]
*  I think it could be a combination of a number of things. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1550.94s)]
*  I think it could be how society at large has framed faith and religion and banished it [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1554.94s)]
*  from visible culture, from areas in the culture where you used to see more people, I think, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1563.54s)]
*  kind of framing their faith within the context of what they do or like even presidents and [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1575.74s)]
*  people would invoke just in their speech would invoke God in the way that they don't do that [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1583.74s)]
*  anymore and I think- [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1588.78s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's a shortage of politicians talking about- [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1590.26s)]
*  But not without a negative connotation to it. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1593.5s)]
*  Put it this way, I'll speak for myself. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1596.02s)]
*  I had a conversation several years ago about the discussion of faith in the workplace. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1597.9s)]
*  There were a non-actor, it was a sort of a production member and I know we shared a similar [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1607.5s)]
*  faith and we hadn't really talked about it but there was a spark of a conversation that [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1616.0600000000002s)]
*  made me think, oh, let me ask them about this. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1622.5800000000002s)]
*  They went on to say, to kind of it carefully admonish me like, hey, just be careful. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1626.66s)]
*  You really shouldn't talk about these kinds of things because a lot of people are biased [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1634.14s)]
*  against Christians in this industry so you might want to just kind of keep a lid on that. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1639.14s)]
*  I thought, but it's just us talking. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1646.5s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1650.54s)]
*  I think what I recognized is that there was such a deep fear of being quote unquote found [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1651.74s)]
*  out that they had a sense of faith that it was just, it was not okay to possess that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1660.6200000000001s)]
*  And for me, that's not okay. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1669.18s)]
*  It's not okay to be told I can't practice my faith or express it, especially if I'm [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1672.26s)]
*  I'm not going around saying, here's the Bible, do me a favor, just read that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1679.3s)]
*  I'm not asking anybody to convert. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1683.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1686.3s)]
*  I've never once said, do me a favor, you should convert. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1687.3s)]
*  I just live out my mission here. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1691.9399999999998s)]
*  I be who I am and if people want to ask me questions or invite me to come talk to 200,000 [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1694.74s)]
*  people and share my thoughts about certain things, I'll pray on it first. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1703.02s)]
*  Like with the march, the weeks were leading right up to it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1709.7s)]
*  I didn't want to do it. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1714.9s)]
*  I thought, this can't be good for an actor. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1715.9s)]
*  Then I got to this moment that I had when I first completely surrendered everything [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1722.82s)]
*  to God before I booked The Chosen. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1729.56s)]
*  And it was the same, there was this same feeling of, you know what, I'm asking you to do this [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1734.44s)]
*  and not worry about it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1747.2s)]
*  And it was like this wave of peace just kind of swept over me. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1750.6s)]
*  And they said, just speak from the heart. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1754.1599999999999s)]
*  If you think about the work you're doing in terms of mission, how much of that mission [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1757.8s)]
*  feels to you evangelical in nature? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1765.28s)]
*  If somebody watches the show and is merely entertained and nothing more, do you feel [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1769.6399999999999s)]
*  that something has been left on the table? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1777.44s)]
*  No. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1780.3999999999999s)]
*  I think one of the reasons that we're successful and it's one of the priorities for both Dallas [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1781.4s)]
*  and myself and I think everybody involved is that we recognize first and foremost, this [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1791.92s)]
*  is a TV show. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1797.4s)]
*  It's based on scriptures, based on the gospels, but there's stuff that we've had to take creative [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1799.0400000000002s)]
*  license in certain situations to be able to tell a more well-rounded story. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1803.72s)]
*  But if the vehicle of this story is anything less than top quality, if it's not a great [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1810.12s)]
*  TV show first, then anything else that any of us might want to have people take away [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1816.52s)]
*  from the show from a personal perspective or a faith perspective, none of that's going [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  to matter. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1827.6799999999998s)]
*  Like if you take a piece of gold and you wad it up in a ball of trash and you throw it [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1829.04s)]
*  on the sidewalk and say, you should pick that up. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1834.88s)]
*  Like, no, get lost. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1838.16s)]
*  Nobody's going to want to even touch it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1840.2s)]
*  They'll just walk by it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1843.96s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1846.2800000000002s)]
*  If the message behind the show is a little piece of gold wrapped up in a wad of garbage, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1847.68s)]
*  forget it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1852.88s)]
*  You're done. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1853.88s)]
*  Yeah, it still has to be a great TV show first and then everything else from that can flow. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1854.88s)]
*  Those who have been on successful TV shows, I think it's not uncommon for them to have [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1861.12s)]
*  been typecast because of the familiarity that people have with the characters that they [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1868.9599999999998s)]
*  played. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1874.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's not even factoring into or taking into account playing Jesus. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1875.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you have any concern about sort of the industry typecasting you in that role? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1885.24s)]
*  Are you getting any clues out there in the world about that? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1892.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1895.16s)]
*  And I don't want to feel like I'm beating a dead horse. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1898.28s)]
*  But it's really true, David. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1902.56s)]
*  Like whatever happens, man, whatever is meant for me will be mine. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1914.36s)]
*  If I did nothing else for the rest of my life as an actor on camera, but Jesus in the chosen, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1915.9199999999998s)]
*  and that's all people remembered me for. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1923.52s)]
*  Well, the fact that they remember me at all, that's amazing. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm good because the show is just a vehicle for this point of human contact and this encounter [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1929.48s)]
*  that we're all meant to have with each other and with the divine beyond us. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1942.6s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much for being so generous with your time and your conversation [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1947.6s)]
*  today. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1953.44s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1954.44s)]
*  I'm looking forward to talking to you again on Thursday. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1955.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1958.28s)]
*  It's been great. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1959.28s)]
*  After the break, I call Jonathan Rumi back and he tells me why he thinks the chosen should [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1960.28s)]
*  make Hollywood less wary of religion. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1965.2s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to do this again. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1969.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1972.0800000000002s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1973.0800000000002s)]
*  You're in your hotel now? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1974.0800000000002s)]
*  I am. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1975.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1976.0800000000002s)]
*  You're getting a look at the Dave Cave. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1979.0800000000002s)]
*  This is the Dave Cave. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  Is this your own curated home or is this the work corner? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1981.0800000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1986.04s)]
*  What an honor. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1987.04s)]
*  What an honor. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1988.04s)]
*  Let me just ask a seasonally appropriate question. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1989.92s)]
*  At this point in American culture, Christmas basically feels sort of like a secular holiday. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=1992.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2001.2s)]
*  Do you have feelings about how secular Christmas has become? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2002.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2008.0s)]
*  It's been almost 100% secularized in terms of media and culture. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2009.64s)]
*  I think it's hard to sort of see it being hijacked, but it's been like that for ... I [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2018.2s)]
*  remember as a kid seeing these signs around churches around Christmas time. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2027.6799999999998s)]
*  It says, keep Christ in Christmas, especially now. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2032.4399999999998s)]
*  Any movie that comes out during the season that's about Christmas, there's no trace [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2035.84s)]
*  of Jesus in it at all. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2041.1999999999998s)]
*  It's unfortunate, but that's why guys like Dallas Jenkins are around to kind of give [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  people the alternatives. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2051.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is what this is about, to remember that yes, Christmas is supposed to be joyful, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2053.26s)]
*  but at the end of the day, the reason for Christmas ultimately leads us to the cross. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2058.5400000000004s)]
*  The birth of Christ is meant to ultimately lead us to the cross of Christ to bring the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2065.2200000000003s)]
*  world hope and salvation and everything that comes with that. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2070.5s)]
*  You told this interesting anecdote about ... It was a discussion with a crew member [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2075.7s)]
*  about how discussing faith at work was sort of a no-go. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2082.8199999999997s)]
*  What might account for why faith is tricky for Hollywood? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why, because I think when you look at the numbers with how The Chosen has [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2092.1s)]
*  performed and how other projects like Jesus Revolution have done with audiences and there's [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2096.3s)]
*  an audience that's there. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2110.42s)]
*  But I think maybe because for so long there has been a rash of media and content and films [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2112.78s)]
*  made under the guise of being related to faith that have just missed the mark in terms of [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2123.22s)]
*  excellence or they read is so heavy-handed in their attempts to proselytize that essentially [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2131.86s)]
*  they're made for the choir. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2143.26s)]
*  With The Chosen, it's like, well, we really see ourselves as a historical drama. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2147.22s)]
*  30% of our audience now is non-religious. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2152.7799999999997s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2156.7s)]
*  And for a show that the early adopters were Christians, to get to the point now where [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2157.7s)]
*  globally it's one of the most watched TV shows in the entire world and 30% of that audience [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2162.8599999999997s)]
*  is non-religious, I think that's pretty significant. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2169.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't really know why Hollywood would be afraid of that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2172.8199999999997s)]
*  I think if you're not telling these stories with the sense of truth and authenticity and [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2178.9s)]
*  respect that they deserve, then you end up with films that do miss the mark or they alienate [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2186.5s)]
*  the core audience that they're trying to reach. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2197.34s)]
*  And I think that's where we get it right. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2200.5s)]
*  You talked a lot about the idea of surrendering to God and how once you decided to give up [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2202.42s)]
*  trying to control things, things then took off for you. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2210.06s)]
*  And I think that for non-believers, the idea of surrender and what that actually means [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2216.26s)]
*  in practice can be a little hard to understand. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2224.9s)]
*  It can just sound like a well-meaning cliche, I think. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2228.1800000000003s)]
*  In the way that when you hear an athlete talk about, we're just taking it one game [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2232.26s)]
*  at a time and giving it 110%. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2239.1000000000004s)]
*  It's not untrue, but it's not really helping you to understand what's going on. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  And I wonder if you can try to explain a little bit more concretely about what it actually [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2246.86s)]
*  for you to surrender and sort of let go. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2257.9s)]
*  I think that's a great question. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2262.82s)]
*  I think the simplest way to describe it is knowing or arriving at the position of where [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2265.3s)]
*  I recognize that my ability to control my destiny, my fate, my path, whatever you want [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2274.7000000000003s)]
*  to call it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2283.42s)]
*  Ultimately, I believe is beyond me. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2285.94s)]
*  Yet I have to participate in the process of moving forward, of achievement, of trying [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2292.06s)]
*  to follow the direction that I believe I'm meant to go. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2301.2200000000003s)]
*  When I came to the conclusion in that moment that we talked about, that moment of surrender, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2308.26s)]
*  I came to the conclusion that for the previous eight years up to that point, I think that [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2316.0600000000004s)]
*  God had an idea or a plan for me. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2323.7200000000003s)]
*  And then it's like he said, okay, I've given you these gifts, I've given you these talents, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2327.38s)]
*  do something with them. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2334.78s)]
*  And I'm kind of like, oh, okay, let me go do something with them. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2336.54s)]
*  And sort of leaving him out of the discernment process when it came to certain steps to take [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2341.66s)]
*  to move forward. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2347.98s)]
*  And so I did that for years and years and years. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2350.1s)]
*  And I think as a person of faith, you necessarily cannot keep God separate from any part of [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2353.02s)]
*  your life, especially in areas where you're struggling. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2363.5s)]
*  And for me, it was in a moment of severe stress and anxiety and borderline fiscal destitution [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2368.46s)]
*  that I basically said, I can't do it on my own. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2378.42s)]
*  I recognize I've been trying to do everything that I thought I was supposed to do, but it [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2383.98s)]
*  hasn't worked. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2389.86s)]
*  What I realized is that I've never checked in and thought whether or not this particular [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2391.1s)]
*  action was the right move, or that was what God might want from my life. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2399.7000000000003s)]
*  So now, it was essentially a prayer where I say, I want whatever you want from me, because [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2407.18s)]
*  you know better than I do what's good for me. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2414.58s)]
*  So whatever that is, show me what it is. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2417.34s)]
*  You're so firmly on your path now, but are there ways in which your faith is still being [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2424.7400000000002s)]
*  tested? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2432.9s)]
*  Constantly. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2434.9s)]
*  God willing, I'm on the path. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2437.82s)]
*  But that's part of the mystery of faith. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2441.86s)]
*  God ultimately is unknowable. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2444.82s)]
*  Give me the nitty-gritty. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2446.3s)]
*  Where are you being tested? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2450.6600000000003s)]
*  They asked St. Paul about that, and he never really quite answered directly. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2454.1400000000003s)]
*  He had a prayer. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  He's like, Lord, take this thorn from my side. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2460.6600000000003s)]
*  Three times he said, I asked the Lord to take this thorn from my side. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2463.46s)]
*  And God said, no, I'm not going to take that from you, because my grace is sufficient. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2466.82s)]
*  In other words, he needed Paul to have this thing, this weakness, whatever it was, so [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2472.5s)]
*  that Paul would always depend on God for everything that he got. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2480.02s)]
*  And I feel similarly with my own sort of things. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2485.42s)]
*  I'm not comparing myself to Paul in any aspect whatsoever. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2490.18s)]
*  But we all deal with something, right? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2493.62s)]
*  We're all suffering and struggling with something. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2495.18s)]
*  I'm a woefully flawed human being, but I'm trying to do the best that I can with the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2498.66s)]
*  gifts that I've been given. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2503.62s)]
*  And by me even just walking the walk of faith publicly, it's not something that I ever intended [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2505.38s)]
*  to do. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2512.8199999999997s)]
*  It's something that during the pandemic, I literally felt pushed to do. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2513.8199999999997s)]
*  And I started doing it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2520.1s)]
*  I started praying live on my social media accounts. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2521.5s)]
*  And I thought, what am I doing? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2526.14s)]
*  This is curricular, because it would first of all out me as a Christian, and then in [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2528.26s)]
*  many cases, even more stringently out me as a Catholic Christian, which people find even [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2537.5s)]
*  harder to take. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2542.66s)]
*  You know, there's like a billion Catholics in the world. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2543.66s)]
*  There are, but I don't know that they're all here in America, and most of my audience. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2548.94s)]
*  You're the current president Catholic. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2556.42s)]
*  But it just wasn't something I'd ever thought to do or wanted to do or felt that I should [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2560.78s)]
*  do. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2565.02s)]
*  I'd always kept it separate. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2566.02s)]
*  And then I just felt this thought, this inclination, like you should do this, because people are [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2567.58s)]
*  struggling really bad right now. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2575.1s)]
*  And it's going to bring peace to a lot of people. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2576.98s)]
*  So, you know, I'm just trying to go where I'm led, man. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2580.18s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you and happy holidays. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2587.2999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2590.8999999999996s)]
*  Likewise to a big couple of us. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=worz6lWCkuM&t=2591.8999999999996s)]
