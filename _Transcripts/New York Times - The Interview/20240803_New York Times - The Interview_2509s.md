# 'The Interview': Vince Vaughn Turned This Interview Into Self-Help
**New York Times - The Interview:** [August 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA)
*  David Marquese [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=0.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=3.44s)]
*  I'm David Marquese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=6.28s)]
*  One of the great things about my job is that I get to talk with people whose work I love. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=10.24s)]
*  But as much as I love that, the even greater thing about my job is when those people and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=15.4s)]
*  what they want to talk about surprise me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=20.64s)]
*  It doesn't happen often. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=23.32s)]
*  It did happen with Vince Vaughn. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=25.28s)]
*  The Vince Vaughn in my head is the charismatic guys guy from all those raunchy comedies of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=28.28s)]
*  the early 2000s, old school, dodgeball, wedding crashers, and of course we can't forget swingers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=33.32s)]
*  I'd argue there's a whole generation of men who basically tried to steal Vaughn's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=38.64s)]
*  neo-rat pack vibe from that movie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Since those films, really after the R rated comedies that Vaughn made his name with kind [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=45.72s)]
*  of lost their cultural mojo, he's turned his focus more to dramatic work, like the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=49.52s)]
*  second season of True Detective and his more recent performances in the brutal crime films [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  of director S. Craig Zoller. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=59.16s)]
*  And as good as Vaughn was with that kind of material, I just never connected those moody [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  anti-heroes to the guy playing them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=65.6s)]
*  So ahead of our interview, I made what is perhaps the common journalist mistake of expecting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=68.88s)]
*  to talk with the guy from those comedies, the sarcastic, quick-witted, basically lighthearted [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=73.72s)]
*  Vince Vaughn. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=79.12s)]
*  That's also partly because his newest role as a wise-ass former detective in the Apple [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=80.88s)]
*  TV Plus series Bad Monkey felt to me like an intentional update of his comedy persona. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=84.84s)]
*  But what I was expecting from Vaughn wasn't what I got. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=91.8s)]
*  Instead, I got something more challenging and more earnest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=94.88s)]
*  Which is to say, I got a surprise. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=99.16s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Vince Vaughn. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=102.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about Bad Monkey. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=110.64s)]
*  So this, to my mind, would fit within the R-rated comedy kind of world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=116.4s)]
*  And my understanding is that Hollywood doesn't really know what to do with R-rated comedies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=122.08s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=127.0s)]
*  Why do you think that they've become harder for Hollywood to crack with audiences? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=128.0s)]
*  When you talk about the R comedies in Hollywood, I feel like there's always these set of rules [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=133.36s)]
*  that get handed down like they come in stone, that the executives follow. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  Generationally they change, but their goal is not to get fired, in my mind's eye, that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=147.12s)]
*  they can defend why they greenlit something. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  And everyone's looking for the answer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=155.76s)]
*  Who doesn't want to be an expert or be right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think that they've out-thought themselves. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=159.92s)]
*  And the R comedies, which took off, was really the studio saying to young people that were [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  go ahead. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=169.28s)]
*  They didn't micromanage. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=170.28s)]
*  Like, we were on the sets changing lines and trying to make each other laugh. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=171.28s)]
*  And I think it's not done as well by committee. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=175.92s)]
*  It's good to get a group of people and kind of let them go and play. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think they started managing everything too much and trying to control it all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  I think an undercurrent to that answer is that the studios or the powers that be got [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=188.56s)]
*  timid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=195.28s)]
*  And the question that is raised for me, based on what you said, is how much of that timidity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=197.24s)]
*  is also the result of a changed cultural context? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=203.76s)]
*  Do you think the culture has changed such that the kinds of movies that were your bread [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=207.56s)]
*  and butter for a while there are just not in vogue anymore? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=213.44s)]
*  Or the studios don't quite feel comfortable making those kinds of comedies? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=218.68s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=224.82s)]
*  I mean, if you look culturally in vogue, I mean, look at the stand-up comics. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=225.82s)]
*  Why is the audience gravitating to those comics that are challenging with the things that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=230.42s)]
*  they're doing and funny? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  How does that square the ratings and the numbers and the things that are said? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=236.98s)]
*  How does that square? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=240.94s)]
*  You know, you have people that are there that are open to these ideas and having fun and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=241.94s)]
*  pushing the envelope and people are watching it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  So that would answer the question for anybody that there's an appetite and people enjoy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=248.82s)]
*  and that there's the people got timid is the right answer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  And the people that got timid knew better. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=258.64s)]
*  It wasn't like they felt righteous, like this was somehow wrong. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=260.48s)]
*  It's just the pressures of the moment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  They were already in the door working. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=266.88s)]
*  What do you mean by the pressures of the moment? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=269.26s)]
*  The culture didn't change. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=271.1s)]
*  You know, human beings are the same now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=273.12s)]
*  Human nature as when the myths were written. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no difference. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=279.52s)]
*  And part of going and having stories and storytelling and songs, you know, to explore these ideas [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  and allow those feelings, certain feelings or emotions to come to the forefront are super [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=288.26s)]
*  important actually because they exist in all of us. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=292.82s)]
*  You know, like the Shel Silverstein song, Boy Named Sue, that Johnny Cash made famous, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  the want to kill your parent because of something they did younger with a name, you know, is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  something that could exist inside people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=309.36s)]
*  I don't know that we have to boycott that song because Shel Silverstein or Johnny Cash [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  are encouraging the murdering of parents for mistakes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=316.6s)]
*  It's an insane thought process. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=320.04s)]
*  But I mean, it's a simple concept. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=322.36s)]
*  But I don't know that Boy Named Sue was ever out of vogue. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=324.94000000000005s)]
*  I think there might have been people who were overthinking it or having an ego of such that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=328.6s)]
*  they could control the world. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=335.0s)]
*  So just to be clear, I don't think anybody's trying to cancel Boy Named Sue, but sort of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=337.12s)]
*  the thing you're dancing around is a little bit like sort of the cancel culture impulse. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=341.58s)]
*  And so do you think that there are stories and ideas that are not getting told that you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=345.58s)]
*  think should be getting told? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=351.38s)]
*  No, I'm not dancing around it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=353.58s)]
*  And I don't think there was ever a canceling. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=355.94s)]
*  I think there was a moment of certain people feeling like they could be the judge and jury [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=357.38s)]
*  of what is a story or what's too far. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=363.1s)]
*  You know, that's I think sometimes that in their attempt to cancel stuff, they made it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=365.54s)]
*  bigger. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a crazy thing as human beings to think that my ideas are the best. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  And if I can just force people to do what I believe in, the world will be great. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=375.48s)]
*  And I think the place for stories for campfires and always were people who went out into the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=380.12s)]
*  woods and came back and challenged us with these ideas and these things. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think that that's important. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=393.62s)]
*  But yeah, I don't need someone to take a book off the shelf. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=395.85999999999996s)]
*  I think I should be allowed to choose what I read and what I don't read. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=398.9s)]
*  And I also think that's part of the journey is exploring these things. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=402.0s)]
*  And if we take away the ability for people to dive into and embrace these feelings and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=406.5s)]
*  concepts, it's not our place to do so. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=411.74s)]
*  What's an example of something that you saw or read that challenged you and opened up [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=417.12s)]
*  your mind or opened up your range of thought? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=423.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I remember it started with literature. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=426.6s)]
*  I read books a lot younger. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=429.36s)]
*  What stuff? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=431.36s)]
*  The Body by Stephen King. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=432.36s)]
*  But the one by Stephen King that really blew me away was Rage. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=435.22s)]
*  That's the one about. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=437.96s)]
*  That's the school shooter. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=438.96s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=440.36s)]
*  I read it when I was a freshman in high school, but it was about a kid who was disenfranchised [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=441.36s)]
*  and takes his class hostage. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=446.76s)]
*  He takes his class hostage. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=448.22s)]
*  And it was like the Breakfast Club, but like a darker R-rated version because he kind of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  holds the class hostage after shooting the teacher. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=456.24s)]
*  And he sort of says, you know, we were friends younger, and now you don't even look at me [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=462.22s)]
*  in the hallway. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=466.74s)]
*  The captain of the team, the kid that's kind of the outsider, the cheerleader, this girl. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=467.8s)]
*  And he sort of goes in this short story and is sort of challenging these social dynamics [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=473.5s)]
*  that have occurred once kids get to high school. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=478.3s)]
*  And I thought it was a really powerful story. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=481.46s)]
*  And I was of the age where these things were actually happening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=485.08s)]
*  So how did it change you? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=488.18s)]
*  It just gave me perspective on in the same way that like sometimes someone in a different [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=490.4s)]
*  avenue is hurting and not what they seem to you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  It's one of the great things about the John Hughes movies, which I think was lost on the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=500.3s)]
*  movies, the teenage movies that came after him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=503.9s)]
*  And the John Hughes movies, if you use Breakfast Club as an example, they all arc and transform [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=507.74s)]
*  to realize that they're complete human beings. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=513.7s)]
*  They're not just the jock or not just the homecoming queen or the weird girl or the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=516.78s)]
*  geek. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=523.02s)]
*  And the reason those endure, I don't think they've ever gone out of vogue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=524.18s)]
*  I think all of those movies still play and I think they play for everybody. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=527.5s)]
*  I think they play for all people from wherever they're from because I think that they're [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=531.26s)]
*  investigating and exploring in a comedic way the truth, which is that, you know, sometimes [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=536.04s)]
*  we fall into a group because of our experiences or our circumstances. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=542.96s)]
*  Sometimes we're afraid of others and, you know, people are hurting and protecting themselves. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=547.44s)]
*  But in truth, there's more of a shared experience and more in common than not. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=553.64s)]
*  I think, you know, your argument is that people are still seeing those movies because they [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=559.64s)]
*  have themes that continue to resonate. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=563.88s)]
*  Even though we might think the culture is changing, there are sort of verities in those [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=567.16s)]
*  films that resonate with people. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=571.6s)]
*  I guess I'm not having an argument. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=573.68s)]
*  It's not an argument. It's more so an observation of reality that in that movie, those [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=575.56s)]
*  characters from other backgrounds find a moment of acceptance and perspective on each [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=583.96s)]
*  other, but they start very opposed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=591.28s)]
*  So it's less of an argument and it's more of saying the purpose of songs and music or [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=595.72s)]
*  any of this stuff really, and it's the place to do it in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=603.12s)]
*  It's a place to express yourself and to give over to emotions and feelings or a journey [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=606.68s)]
*  of life. So it's less of an argument, truly, and more of a response to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=614.8s)]
*  the line of what we're talking about, which is nothing has changed except you have a bunch [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=621.76s)]
*  of dumb people who think that they are somehow more righteous than their neighbor, who are [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=627.28s)]
*  going to impose through force that it's somehow bad to explore human beings that are in the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=635.52s)]
*  extremes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=644.16s)]
*  This is sort of a heavier question, but I was thinking about that period, I would say, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=646.0s)]
*  like basically from old school, maybe to couples retreat, when it was just stuff was really [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=653.04s)]
*  connecting, it seemed like one after another. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=658.68s)]
*  And in that time, you did a couple of films with Owen Wilson. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=661.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=665.16s)]
*  So at the time, your career was really going gangbusters. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=665.64s)]
*  He was really struggling personally. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=669.28s)]
*  And I know you guys were friends and he had there was a suicide attempt. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=671.24s)]
*  And I thought to be having the personal success while your pal is sort of at a low ebb, like [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=675.28s)]
*  does that teach you something or show you something about like the meaninglessness of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  success? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=688.4s)]
*  Well, I adore Owen. I think he's not only super funny and smart, but he's very empathetic. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=692.76s)]
*  But as far as success, it depends on your definition of it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  I never saw success as the results. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=703.6s)]
*  If you feel like you were engaged and you did your best and you feel good about it, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=707.72s)]
*  sometimes the results aren't there, but you feel good because you got better. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=711.64s)]
*  And sometimes you could get results, but you weren't really growing. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=717.24s)]
*  And I say this to you, like as a parent looking at kids, you know, whether they're trying to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=720.84s)]
*  cut their food, they're not going to get a result of a smooth cutting of food at five. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=725.16s)]
*  But if they're trying their hardest and you encourage them and they make mistakes and they [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=733.84s)]
*  feel and you're telling them you did great because you really, you know, I saw you holding [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=738.72s)]
*  your fork and you lined your knife up. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=743.64s)]
*  You were successful today. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  What a great job. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  I want you to get more personal, though. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=750.0400000000001s)]
*  Give me something tangible. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  OK, pick any area you want. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=753.68s)]
*  I'll pick two. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=756.76s)]
*  OK, so first, let's start with filmmaking. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=757.8s)]
*  Like what's something that you, you know, you weren't good at and then you tried it and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  the results were not good. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=766.92s)]
*  And then you got better at? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=767.88s)]
*  I would say everything, like every aspect of it, acting on camera, learning to really [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=769.88s)]
*  just talk to the person as if there wasn't cameras there, memorizing dialogue. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=776.24s)]
*  It now it's very easy for me, but when I started, it was hard. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=781.68s)]
*  I think it is for all actors. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=784.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a process because it's the only way we do learn. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=786.92s)]
*  And the second example I was looking for is in your life. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=790.04s)]
*  What's something that you weren't good at that you've improved at? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=794.64s)]
*  Everything again. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=797.68s)]
*  Don't say everything again. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=798.88s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=800.88s)]
*  Well, I can pick any aspect of it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=801.64s)]
*  Like pick one, pick one and burrow into that baby. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=806.8s)]
*  Something in my personal life I felt that I wasn't good at. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=808.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=812.6s)]
*  God, there's just I just my mind goes to just not an area I was good at. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=813.6s)]
*  Giving a speech publicly was scary to me. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=819.6s)]
*  I was nervous to if I had to stand up and share something or something as simple as [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=823.84s)]
*  letting a girl know that I liked her rejection. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=831.32s)]
*  My point is. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=835.0s)]
*  You have to take the focus off yourself, evaluating yourself negatively. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=837.24s)]
*  You have to then say, find in it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=842.92s)]
*  Why is it worth it to do this? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=845.48s)]
*  Like, how do I take those things that are a challenge and use those to get better, to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=847.48s)]
*  make them a strength and I got to get started and it's OK if it goes bad or it doesn't go [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=852.2s)]
*  well. I can't cheat the process of trying. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=858.32s)]
*  If I'm somehow being less personal or feeling you, I'm not I'm not aware of how. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=861.88s)]
*  No, I guess. I guess. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=866.28s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I was just. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=867.0799999999999s)]
*  In a way, both the personal and professional examples felt general rather than specific. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=869.36s)]
*  I'll give you one then from a professional point of view of. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=876.04s)]
*  So in swingers, when we were shooting and we got cameras, the idea was to just talk [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=880.4799999999999s)]
*  and to improvise and not feel so precious. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=887.8s)]
*  And I learned that if you had one camera on both of you and a master shot or if you had [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=890.7199999999999s)]
*  two cameras set up at the time, we could make it conversational and step on each other as [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=896.92s)]
*  long as we were listening. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  And I didn't really understand that until we made that movie. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=903.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=906.68s)]
*  Wait, you know what I was looking at? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  I was reading old magazine cover stories of you. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=909.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  I wait at this. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=915.76s)]
*  Look, I'll even show you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  This is details magazine. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=917.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=920.52s)]
*  2001 smoldering. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=921.28s)]
*  If you say so. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  GQ, look at that one. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=927.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's very Brando. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=929.4s)]
*  The cover there. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=931.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  I guess. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  And then there's a I'll spare you the other details magazine cover in 1997. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=933.04s)]
*  But that's very what is it? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=937.0s)]
*  Put it on. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  No, no, it's just I don't know. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=938.64s)]
*  You really want to. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=939.4s)]
*  OK, there's 1997 details. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=940.68s)]
*  Going back and reading those is interesting because the picture that they paint of you is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  like a rabble rouser, guys, guy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I think every one of those stories involves a scene at a bar where you and the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=951.24s)]
*  writer are drinking or something like that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=954.72s)]
*  And it was interesting to me because I thought, are they unable to separate Vince Vaughn, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=956.24s)]
*  the guy from the kind of characters or basically from the swingers character? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=962.4s)]
*  Or is that how you were at that time? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I had a lot of sides to myself. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=972.4000000000001s)]
*  I was definitely a guy that enjoyed going out with friends and we would definitely go [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=976.0s)]
*  out to bars. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=980.24s)]
*  But, you know, I was also an actor who loved to read and watch things. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of sides. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=987.5200000000001s)]
*  So to your point, you might be right that the writers picking to meet me at a location [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=988.96s)]
*  and they're selling a magazine. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=993.44s)]
*  And so, you know, they're saying, hey, let's meet here or do this. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, a lot of times they would say we're going to pick a location or a place, but [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1001.76s)]
*  have it be a bar or a restaurant. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1006.0799999999999s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1007.52s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, I definitely had sides of me. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  I think I've had a very unique life. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1013.04s)]
*  I had a lot of very extreme experiences that I think just gave me perspectives and worlds [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  that were very unique. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1020.88s)]
*  You know, I have. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  Can you share one of those with me? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1023.52s)]
*  What was one of those? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1024.72s)]
*  I had two extreme. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1025.84s)]
*  My grandparents, both sides were just from different extreme backgrounds. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  And then my one grandfather was an Italian immigrant from Naples who I think only went [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1030.8s)]
*  to school till he was eight. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  And he owned like a small carnival park. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a jeweler. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  He was a pawn shop bloker. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1043.36s)]
*  He wasn't around my mom very much. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1045.12s)]
*  My mom was raised by a single mom. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1046.96s)]
*  She supported all the kids by herself. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1049.76s)]
*  No money and had a beauty salon. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1051.36s)]
*  And then my dad's father, Vaughn, which has been in America from the beginning, he was [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1054.24s)]
*  a sharecropper and a steelworker and had a 100-acre farm. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1060.88s)]
*  And then his wife was Lebanese, Christian Lebanese. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1065.28s)]
*  My dad was the first to go to college in his family and worked really hard. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1068.88s)]
*  And then I kind of ascended from like growing up in apartments and then ended up in an upper [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  class suburb with a really good public education starting when I was eight. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  So I just had a lot of exposure to very different things and very different perspectives of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1082.88s)]
*  people and different worldviews. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1089.04s)]
*  And so I think I was shaped by all of that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1091.68s)]
*  And I think, you know, going back to the Breakfast Club, if we may, you're talking about an [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1094.5600000000002s)]
*  archetype that they're presenting. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1101.28s)]
*  That's a side of me, but it's not the whole story. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1103.44s)]
*  So I just always had these different kinds of interests, you know? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1107.52s)]
*  How do you think your sort of the extremes of your background might have influenced your [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1112.16s)]
*  politics? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1117.04s)]
*  Are you libertarian? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1118.24s)]
*  I guess it saves, yes. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1120.8000000000002s)]
*  I definitely am a believer more in allowing individuals to make choices. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1121.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1126.8000000000002s)]
*  So like I think that drugs should be legal and I think people should have guns. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1127.76s)]
*  So I kind of for people making choices, empowering that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1132.3200000000002s)]
*  But in for my politics and so much that I realized that you had different camps and [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1137.76s)]
*  cultures that people from that camp would feel strong about. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1142.8s)]
*  Like the hippies would get high and say, we're not hurting anyone. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1146.56s)]
*  What's the big deal? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1150.08s)]
*  And then the hunters would say, you know, we have these guns and, you know, we have [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1151.36s)]
*  a right to defend ourselves and what's the big deal? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1155.2s)]
*  And they were kind of the same. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1157.52s)]
*  Well, they're both both. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1159.92s)]
*  Guns and weed are not exactly the same. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1160.96s)]
*  But I'll tell you why I think it is the same. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1162.64s)]
*  The fear is if someone gets high that they're going to do something that could hurt people. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1164.48s)]
*  Where sometimes they just go to bed. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1169.2s)]
*  They're not really, you know, it's not like they're going out. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1170.96s)]
*  And the fear is if someone has a gun, they might hurt somebody. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1174.24s)]
*  But sometimes they're just hunting and, you know, using it and shooting and they're not. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1176.4s)]
*  They never do. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1180.24s)]
*  And so what I realized is, is that we're so shaped by our environments and where we're from. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1181.6s)]
*  I think even in parenting, like sometimes people parent the way their parents did. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1189.52s)]
*  Or in a reaction to it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1194.08s)]
*  Well, I find it to be more complicated than that. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1195.76s)]
*  Yeah, in a reaction, but I find it complicated. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1198.32s)]
*  I'll finish the political thing because I think you're interested and I'll go the other. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  I'd rather say let people make their choices. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1205.28s)]
*  And they can make different choices and have the consequences of their choices. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1208.8s)]
*  Does politics come up in Hollywood? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1213.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think there's an idea. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1215.84s)]
*  Maybe it's a straw man. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1217.04s)]
*  But like a criticism of it would be that it's sort of overly woke or too concerned about [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1218.72s)]
*  political correctness. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1225.2s)]
*  Do you feel like that's something that you've ever actually experienced [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1226.64s)]
*  or have come up against or witnessed? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1230.32s)]
*  Oh, for sure there has been. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1232.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1233.44s)]
*  So what would that be? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1233.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1234.88s)]
*  I don't know if I can tie it to politics. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's so fucking boring. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1236.72s)]
*  But yes, anyone into censorship or banning stuff is, I don't know. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1238.48s)]
*  It's never been anything I think is cool. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1244.4s)]
*  I mean, I loved hearing when I was a kid how exciting that NWA came out and that they [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1246.32s)]
*  weren't trying to fit on a radio or Guns N' Roses or Raging Against the Machine. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1252.0s)]
*  I like stuff that was provocative and challenging and committed to a point of view. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1258.0s)]
*  That's rock and roll. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  That's comedy. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1263.28s)]
*  That's art. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1264.08s)]
*  I think the politics stuff is, you know, it's important. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1265.04s)]
*  You should pay attention. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1268.24s)]
*  You should hear different ideas. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1269.28s)]
*  I don't know anyone that feels the same at 60 that did at 20. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1271.3600000000001s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  No, fuck no. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1278.0800000000002s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1279.5200000000002s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  I hate to bring it back to politics, but there's lifetime Republican voters, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1282.24s)]
*  there's lifetime Democrat voters, you know, there's people's religious beliefs. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1285.2800000000002s)]
*  I think, I don't know that those really ebb and flow that widely over the course of someone's lifetime. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1288.64s)]
*  Who the fuck doesn't go through life and one year after the year say, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  fuck, I was on the wrong course or I thought I had it figured out, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1298.32s)]
*  but now I didn't know anything. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  I just think it's crazy. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1304.56s)]
*  What are you wrong about? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1306.88s)]
*  You know, if I am wrong about stuff, I'm not aware of it because [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1309.2s)]
*  I try to reflect on process and evolve it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1313.52s)]
*  You know, I find and I know that I'm not 100% right, but I do know that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1316.48s)]
*  it doesn't come from not thinking about it and trying to course correct. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1322.96s)]
*  So I've never come out of any project or interpersonal relationship [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1328.32s)]
*  or ideas on something and not evolved. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1333.92s)]
*  Vince, I think we're getting the nudge from your publicist. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1338.56s)]
*  Do you have time for one or two more? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1340.48s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1341.76s)]
*  I have time, Lauren. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1342.32s)]
*  I feel like we're just got somewhere good and now we're ending, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1343.68s)]
*  but that's why I get to talk to you again on Monday. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1345.84s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1347.68s)]
*  You know, when I was looking back through your IMDB credits, I saw that, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1348.8s)]
*  you know, really the last few years, aside from popping up on as [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1355.6s)]
*  Freddie Funkhouser on Curb Your Enthusiasm, you really haven't been around that much. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1360.32s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1367.52s)]
*  Did you want to take a break? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  Were you feeling burned out or just doing other things? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1369.52s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1372.8s)]
*  I have, I actually have three things in the can. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1373.6s)]
*  Like we shot Bad Monkey a while ago and then there was the strike. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  And so the release date is later than what was intended because I shot this a little while ago. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  And then I have two movies in the can. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1385.2s)]
*  I just, I did a movie called Nona's. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1386.64s)]
*  And again, then was pushed with the strike. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1390.64s)]
*  And then same with, I just did a movie with Al Pacino and Simon Rex, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1392.8s)]
*  Kate Mara, who's terrific, called Easy's Wall. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1399.44s)]
*  So I have actually have quite a few things completed, but I definitely got more selective, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1402.72s)]
*  I think, in being a parent and enjoying that process. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1409.04s)]
*  I really was more picky and I also wanted to do things again than I felt were [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1413.44s)]
*  things that I hadn't done in recent time. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1418.96s)]
*  For me, it's like you want to ride every ride at the amusement park. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  You want to try different things and get out of, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1425.76s)]
*  it's fun kind of when your feet can't touch the bottom of the ocean, you're a little [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  over your ski. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  So you want to try to grow. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  You want to put yourself in situations maybe where you haven't done something before. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1434.96s)]
*  What rides are still left? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, you know, I think there's always different things to, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1442.88s)]
*  depending on where you're at, to get engaged in. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1446.48s)]
*  And also other sides of it, you know, directing, producing, different budgets. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1449.76s)]
*  And then also, you know, for me really being a parent has just been such a joy. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1456.88s)]
*  Do you have kids? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1461.5200000000002s)]
*  Two, yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  How old? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1463.5200000000002s)]
*  Seven and nine, two girls. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1464.16s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  You get it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  I have a 13-year-old and a 10-year-old, boy and girl. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1468.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1470.8000000000002s)]
*  How has that changed you? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1471.68s)]
*  How has fatherhood changed me? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, gosh, I feel weird saying this stuff when we're sort of at the end of the clock. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1476.72s)]
*  But we got time. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1483.28s)]
*  I can push it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1484.4s)]
*  I got time. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1484.96s)]
*  I got nowhere to go. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1485.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  Also, there's nothing that the listeners are going to be more interested in hearing [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1487.6000000000001s)]
*  in an interview with Vince Vaughn than how fatherhood changed the interviewer guy. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1491.44s)]
*  Yourself, but it is. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1495.04s)]
*  But it's a conversation, right? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1496.5600000000002s)]
*  This is a conversation. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1497.92s)]
*  So I don't feel like it changed me in any fundamental ways. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1498.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  If anything, it foregrounded thoughts and feelings that were already there. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1503.92s)]
*  I felt very ready and comfortable as a father. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1510.56s)]
*  There are other things in my life that changed me in fundamental ways much more than fatherhood. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1514.4s)]
*  What about you? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1520.56s)]
*  Let me ask you this to that point. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1523.2s)]
*  In being a teacher and someone who's kind of guiding someone, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1523.6s)]
*  do you feel that your process or approach has changed as time has gone on? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1528.08s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1535.12s)]
*  But I think basically in ways, this makes me sound like a Colts, like Spock-like person, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1535.92s)]
*  and this is not how I mean it. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1541.84s)]
*  People love Spock, by the way. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1543.04s)]
*  Very popular character. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1544.32s)]
*  You can't have Captain Kirk without Spock, so please continue. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1545.44s)]
*  Also, you're going to have to answer these questions, too. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1550.32s)]
*  I will. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1552.0s)]
*  I want to make it specific. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1552.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  I feel like the differences in this regard have mostly to do with having to understand [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1553.6000000000001s)]
*  where my kids are cognitively at the time I'm trying to teach them a given lesson. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  So the best example of this would be my mom just passed away and thinking about how to [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1566.0800000000002s)]
*  bring my children into that reality. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1573.92s)]
*  How do a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old process what it means to have grandma not [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1576.72s)]
*  around anymore? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1583.04s)]
*  It's been different for the nine-year-old and the seven-year-old because they're just [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1585.2s)]
*  at different places emotionally and cognitively, so I've had to be aware of that. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1588.0s)]
*  But that's really more trying to respond to where they are and less about like, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1591.68s)]
*  oh, I have some new theory of teaching or parenting. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1596.56s)]
*  Sorry to hear about the passing of your mom. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1603.04s)]
*  That's never easy. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1605.04s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1606.24s)]
*  And that's hard. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1606.88s)]
*  I think what you're saying is right. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  I guess for me, the way I interpret it, because I would feel similar to you, except [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1612.4s)]
*  I'll tell you, is having a daughter first, you realize how far behind boys are. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1615.76s)]
*  It's like my daughter would sit and listen and your son's trying to put a fork in the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1620.72s)]
*  electrical outlet. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1624.56s)]
*  It's just very, very different. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1625.6s)]
*  But yes. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1628.08s)]
*  And how did fatherhood change you? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1629.1200000000001s)]
*  I think it's why I was able to define success even more so, understanding how to motivate [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1630.32s)]
*  a kid to keep trying and also allow them to be who they are. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1639.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, you want a kid to be productive and do stuff that's going to build self-esteem, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1642.24s)]
*  but they don't have to do all things in all areas. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1646.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1648.8s)]
*  So I don't know that I've changed as far as like, oh, I was cold and callous and now I've [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1649.12s)]
*  learned to love. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1655.12s)]
*  I think it's just made me more empathetic, more patient, maybe have more tools at encouraging [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1656.24s)]
*  just because of the nature of the job. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1665.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1668.08s)]
*  Could you encourage me? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1668.8s)]
*  What area would you like encouragement in? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1670.88s)]
*  You seem pretty self-assured, which is a good thing. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1672.72s)]
*  Is there an area you feel like you need encouragement? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1675.52s)]
*  I feel like there were places we could have gotten to in this interview that I'm hoping [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1682.48s)]
*  we get to in the second interview that I could have pushed you on harder, that I was [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1685.76s)]
*  chickening out a little bit. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1693.2s)]
*  Well, don't chicken out. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1694.32s)]
*  Go ahead and you can ask what you want. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1695.36s)]
*  But I would say to you, my thought for you to reflect in would be where you think on [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1697.68s)]
*  your own personal journey, being a caretaker for the kids and being there for them, where [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1706.4s)]
*  you think that you might have had shifts in either how you saw yourself or how you saw [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1712.56s)]
*  the world. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  That would ask you to reflect on that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  That's my homework. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to reflect on that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1722.72s)]
*  Just part of our ongoing conversation is where do you think potentially you have shifted [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  perspectives from that experience? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1732.32s)]
*  Before we reconvene next week. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1735.9199999999998s)]
*  Nothing says flying off the shelf like parenting skills. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1742.56s)]
*  That stuff does gangbusters. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1743.2s)]
*  Deeply wrong about that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1744.72s)]
*  But Vince, I'll talk to you in a couple of days. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  I am going to go think about these things. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1748.24s)]
*  And thank you for taking all the time. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1752.0s)]
*  My pleasure, brother. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1752.72s)]
*  Great to speak to you. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1753.44s)]
*  I'll talk to you soon. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1754.08s)]
*  Coming up, I stopped chickening out and asked Vince Vaughn my real questions. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  Hello? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1772.96s)]
*  Hey, it's David. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1784.08s)]
*  Hey, buddy. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1785.12s)]
*  How are you? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1785.6s)]
*  I'm doing good. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1786.24s)]
*  How are you? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1786.8s)]
*  Doing great. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1787.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1788.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1788.6399999999999s)]
*  So Vince, I feel like we got so much to talk about this time. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1789.76s)]
*  I had said to you towards the end of our first conversation that I felt like I chickened out [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1794.8s)]
*  a couple of times. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1799.44s)]
*  So I want to go back to some of the questions that I felt like in the moment I soft-pedaled. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1800.6399999999999s)]
*  So the first one is I had asked you about whether it was difficult for your career to be going [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1806.56s)]
*  gangbusters at the same time Owen Wilson was struggling personally. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  And you gave an answer that was all about how one defines success. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1818.8s)]
*  And I'm not asking for gossip about Owen Wilson or anything private about him. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1823.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand what the emotional dynamics of that moment were for you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1828.0s)]
*  As a human, was it difficult to wrap your head around the experience of doing [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1834.72s)]
*  so well while a friend was struggling? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1839.04s)]
*  Yeah, I just think it's a strange thing to ask somebody. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1843.84s)]
*  I love Owen. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1849.84s)]
*  I think he's super talented. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1850.56s)]
*  It's really not my place to comment or speculate on whatever was going on with him. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1851.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1857.12s)]
*  Other than I think he's terrific. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1858.4s)]
*  And then as you were saying, as my career was going with success or whatever, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1860.56s)]
*  I was really honest when I said I really define success the only way that I think you can, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1866.32s)]
*  which is by attempting your best approach or attempt to whatever you're doing. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1873.36s)]
*  You want to know the real reason I was asking that question? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1881.12s)]
*  Yeah, please, please. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1885.52s)]
*  It was about five years ago, I lost my best friend to suicide. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  And everything was going great for me. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1892.56s)]
*  But there was a part of me that always wondered if I was somehow not seeing what was going on with him [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1895.52s)]
*  because things were sort of going so well for me. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  And I wondered if I could have had a different perspective on that moment. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1909.28s)]
*  I would say that's really where the sort of human, on the most base human level. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1914.24s)]
*  I think that's a common feeling anytime you lose somebody in life, even if it's, you know, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1919.04s)]
*  something that happens by accident. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1924.16s)]
*  Did I spend enough time? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1925.44s)]
*  Was I connected? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1926.48s)]
*  I don't ever think that that's not part of the process of going through any sort of, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1929.2s)]
*  in your case, actually losing your friend. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1934.48s)]
*  But I would also say to you that you're not usually that powerful to be able to come in [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1936.24s)]
*  and fix everybody's stuff all the time. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1943.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1946.08s)]
*  There's a sense of self, I think, that feels like, oh, if I could have done all of these things, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1947.76s)]
*  I could have made that person different. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1951.68s)]
*  I think parents go through that as we were talking. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1954.16s)]
*  And you were sort of suggesting that you've kind of been consistent, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1956.72s)]
*  that you haven't learned as much from it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1960.56s)]
*  But I think as parents, you do realize one thing I can say I've learned is that [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1962.16s)]
*  sometimes people have to go through their experiences. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1966.56s)]
*  Some kids are going to take more reps at listening or other functional skills. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1968.96s)]
*  We're limited, I think, in the ability to change others. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1977.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1982.8s)]
*  And, you know, I want to go back to the parenting thing. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1984.4s)]
*  That was my reflection assignment, and I did reflect on that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1988.16s)]
*  But I want to go back to it in a little bit. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1992.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1994.48s)]
*  But before then, you know, you had brought up that Stephen King novel Rage as sort of [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=1995.54s)]
*  being formative for you, which is about a school shooter type. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2002.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2008.9s)]
*  And you had also talked with me, and you've talked elsewhere about being a Second Amendment guy, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2009.54s)]
*  people should have access to guns. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2016.34s)]
*  And, you know, King himself has advocated for more gun control. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2018.58s)]
*  And I think he actually let that book go out of print because he was worried about [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2021.38s)]
*  its negative influence. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2024.5s)]
*  But America already has way more guns than any other similarly developed country, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2025.62s)]
*  and also more gun violence. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2031.54s)]
*  Like, that's just the cost of doing business in American society. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2034.26s)]
*  Help me understand your logic for why there shouldn't be more. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2037.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2040.34s)]
*  I don't see other actors who say they believe in gun control getting asked it every time [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2040.98s)]
*  they do an interview. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2045.22s)]
*  So there's certainly that somehow becomes a focal point. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2046.1s)]
*  But I think if you're someone who, like you said, you can't get your mind around it, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2050.98s)]
*  I don't know if I'll satisfy your concept with it. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2054.98s)]
*  But the basic idea is just a DNA concept that the individual is free and has a right to [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2058.58s)]
*  protect themselves. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2065.38s)]
*  You get asked that a lot. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2067.14s)]
*  I try and ask questions that people don't get asked a lot. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2068.1s)]
*  No, I think there's a consistency with it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2070.42s)]
*  You know, I think people, you know, going back to stuff that you said earlier, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2072.34s)]
*  I think you kind of answer it with this. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2075.78s)]
*  It's like that becomes a focal point for anybody who dares to not go with whatever the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2077.46s)]
*  group think of the moment is. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2085.14s)]
*  I want to go back now to the homework assignment, the additional reflection, right? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2088.5s)]
*  So the question was, you know, how has fatherhood shifted my perspective? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2093.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2098.18s)]
*  And I think I came up with two answers that I'm going to tell you. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2098.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2102.82s)]
*  So the first answer is, I really think that having kids, so corny, it's almost hard to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2103.54s)]
*  say out loud, but showed me that my capacity for love was deeper than I had previously [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2109.7799999999997s)]
*  understood it to be. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2117.22s)]
*  And that's my first answer. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2120.02s)]
*  How would you define love? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh gosh, that's a great question. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2129.22s)]
*  I would say like an intense feeling of connection and desire for the other's wellbeing. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2131.3s)]
*  Sounds pretty good, right? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2142.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's something that never ends. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2143.3s)]
*  I think we keep evolving and trying to reflect on these things. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2145.94s)]
*  What is love? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2149.3s)]
*  You know, it's an ongoing exploration as people. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2150.02s)]
*  And I think having that in your life, you know, obviously helps you connect [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2153.3s)]
*  in so many different ways to so many different things and opening you up and realizing [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2157.9399999999996s)]
*  sometimes that, you know, there's things that we hold more dear than just our own lives. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2164.2599999999998s)]
*  Where we're fully in the men's group portion of the discussion. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2172.1s)]
*  But the other- [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2176.8999999999996s)]
*  No, I think it's for all people. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2177.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2179.14s)]
*  I think to love something that much, I mean, a country, God, your children, a spouse, a friendship, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2179.62s)]
*  all those things, is sort of that connection to love. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2185.46s)]
*  It's so powerful. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2190.82s)]
*  And I think when you love something that strongly, you're able to forgive things as well. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2192.6600000000003s)]
*  And the second answer that I came up with was that I think it made me [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2199.78s)]
*  think more deeply about what I actually wanted from life. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2208.1800000000003s)]
*  Because, you know, when my kids were really little, like, you know, toddlers and younger, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2212.66s)]
*  I was really unhappy with the job I had at the time and the work I was doing. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2217.54s)]
*  And I was just bringing it home every day, like moping around, you know. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2223.22s)]
*  And then I thought, I do not want my kids to grow up with a grouchy dad who's irritated and sullen [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2227.22s)]
*  because of the work that he's doing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2236.02s)]
*  And so I did then consciously think, I have to change this situation. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2239.06s)]
*  And I did. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2243.38s)]
*  So that's the other big change. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2244.66s)]
*  But I really respect you for that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2246.42s)]
*  And I do think that that's something that the kids bring a mirror to and reflect. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2248.58s)]
*  It's also like those kids are looking at you and you realize [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2252.7400000000002s)]
*  one of the biggest ways they're going to learn is not our speech in the car [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2256.66s)]
*  to and from school, but by actions, by what you do. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2260.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2263.86s)]
*  Do you think having the children- [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2264.7400000000002s)]
*  Why are you so interested in questions about fatherhood? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2267.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, just I'm interested in what you're sharing. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2271.06s)]
*  I think you're being genuine. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2273.46s)]
*  And so I was curious, how did having kids affect your process with dealing with the loss of someone? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2275.46s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if I would connect the kids to it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2284.58s)]
*  The things I would say about that is, you know, it's, you know, losing my best friend. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2288.1000000000004s)]
*  And then I had mentioned, you know, losing my mom. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2293.54s)]
*  It's just like you actually realize, you know, you don't get to live forever. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2296.18s)]
*  You know, I can be outside in a way now and see the hydrangeas in front of my house [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2302.2599999999998s)]
*  and appreciate how beautiful they are. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2308.5s)]
*  Because I know that people who I love will never get to have that appreciation ever again. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2311.38s)]
*  So it just makes the daily going about of my life more beautiful and meaningful [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2316.66s)]
*  in a way that I just didn't have those feelings before. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2324.18s)]
*  And I don't, and maybe that extends to kids a little bit. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2327.94s)]
*  And sort of there's little things that they do that I sort of appreciate in the moment. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2330.42s)]
*  Like, you know, to know that my mom is not going to see these little things that my kids do, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2334.58s)]
*  that I take such pleasure in, and that she would also have taken pleasure in. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2339.62s)]
*  It makes those little things even more profound and moving than I think they would have otherwise [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2343.38s)]
*  been. I think that's beautiful. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2349.38s)]
*  I think, and I think it's painful and it's hard, but those are the gifts that come out of it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2351.3s)]
*  And I don't know that it would be so hard if you didn't love and care so much as what makes it so [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2356.1s)]
*  hard. This is easily the weirdest celebrity interview of all time now. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2361.1400000000003s)]
*  Bad Monkey, starring Vince Vaughn, premiering this month on Apple TV. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2367.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. It feels like a genuine conversation and reflection. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2371.94s)]
*  And you're sharing stuff, you know, that I've been through too, which is, you know, loss and life. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2376.66s)]
*  And I mean, isn't that ultimately what we're exploring through song and stories? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2382.26s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes we have to go through these things to get to the other side. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2388.98s)]
*  There's a journey. It's not, we don't always start at the place of enlightenment. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2395.06s)]
*  Vince, thank you very much for taking all the time to talk with me and to answer the questions. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hP_ToPRfIA&t=2401.94s)]
