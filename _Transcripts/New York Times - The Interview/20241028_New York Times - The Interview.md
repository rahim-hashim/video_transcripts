# John Fetterman's Not-So-Glamorous Political Life
**New York Times - The Interview:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E)
*  You don't see yourself as a politician. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=0.0s)]
*  What does a politician seem to you when you say that in your head? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=1.96s)]
*  What is that? That it's a track. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  You know, everybody's constantly looking for the next the next job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=9.44s)]
*  It's incredibly cynical and transactional and now dysfunctional. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=14.84s)]
*  I've been disappointed on the reality of a part of it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And it's just also astonishing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=23.88s)]
*  And I can't understand why there's people that are willing to spend tens [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and tens of millions of their own money to try to to hold that office, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=28.88s)]
*  because then you can get there and be like, look at the glamour. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=34.04s)]
*  You know, I'm sitting in a 500 square feet apartment, you know, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=38.36s)]
*  and I'm like, I want Grubhub. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=43.12s)]
*  Hey, what do I have? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=44.4s)]
*  And watching bad TV on Netflix or whatever. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I like to to ask all of my colleagues, well, hey, is there like some kind [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=49.04s)]
*  of secret society or like a social life or something glamorous? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=53.0s)]
*  Like, no. And even, you know, Romney, I mean, he's incredibly wealthy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=57.56s)]
*  and he has a nice house. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=61.88s)]
*  But I read that he sits on his nice chair and watches Netflix [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=63.32s)]
*  and eats salmon from his friend and actually puts ketchup on it, which. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=67.8s)]
*  Which so I haven't met that one person [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  that's having that quintessential like glamorous life. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=76.44s)]
*  It's it's been elusive for me, but it's not one that it even appealed to me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=80.92s)]
*  I think people all think life is like the West Wing or something, you know, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=86.04s)]
*  kind of where it's snappy dialogue and it's like, whatever. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=89.68s)]
*  But a lot of it comes down to just really bad performance art. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mms9RhXDV4E&t=93.84s)]
