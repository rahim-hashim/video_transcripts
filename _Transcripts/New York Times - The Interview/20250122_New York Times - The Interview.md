# Curtis Yarvin on JD Vance's Investment in Democracy
**New York Times - The Interview:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0)
*  How invested do you think JD Vance is in democracy? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=0.0s)]
*  It depends what you mean by democracy. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=2.88s)]
*  I mean, I think that the problem is basically when people equate democracy with good government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=5.08s)]
*  When you use that word, you're using a very tricky word. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=11.16s)]
*  I would say that what someone like, I'm on very safe ground despite not knowing him well [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=15.56s)]
*  at all, that someone like JD Vance believes essentially in the common good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=21.8s)]
*  And the idea that government should serve the common good. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  And I think that people like JD and people in the sort of the broader intellectual scene [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=33.36s)]
*  around him, which is very varied intellectual scene, you know, would all agree on that principle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, if that principle, I don't know what you mean by democracy in this context. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=46.36s)]
*  What I do know is that if democracy is against the common good, it's bad. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=52.0s)]
*  And if it's for the common good, it's good. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0eb-My3Pz0&t=56.0s)]
