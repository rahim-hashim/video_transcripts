# Demi Moore Is Done With the Male Gaze [Re-Run]
**New York Times - The Interview:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw)
*  Hi there, it's Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=0.0s)]
*  This week we're going to be re-airing an interview I loved from last year, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2.84s)]
*  a conversation with Demi Moore. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=6.72s)]
*  When we talked, Moore's movie The Substance was just about to open in theaters. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=8.96s)]
*  At the time, I noted that she was already getting awards buzz for her performance. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=13.26s)]
*  And just this week, she received her first ever Oscar nomination [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=17.84s)]
*  for Best Actress for that film, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=21.56s)]
*  making it a great time to revisit this conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Don't worry, we'll have a new episode next week, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=26.48s)]
*  but for now, enjoy my interview with Demi Moore. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=29.38s)]
*  From The New York Times, this is The Interview. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=39.68s)]
*  It is hard to describe Demi Moore's new movie, The Substance. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=43.06s)]
*  On the one hand, it's a dark comedy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=46.82s)]
*  about the horrors of getting older as a woman in Hollywood, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  but it's also a literal body horror film. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  The basic premise is that Moore's character takes this strange elixir [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=55.6s)]
*  that allows her to create a younger, more perfect version of herself. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  And you can see that creation in bloody, visceral detail. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=63.86s)]
*  It's a movie that challenges us to look at what drives our celebrity-obsessed culture [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  and the damage it does to our female stars. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=73.78s)]
*  Moore is already getting awards buzz for it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=76.66s)]
*  And even though, I'll confess, I was kind of grossed out watching it, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  I also couldn't look away. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=83.72s)]
*  I've been mesmerized by Demi Moore my whole life. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=85.58s)]
*  One of her first big films, San Elmo's Fire, in 1985, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=88.62s)]
*  made me want to go to where it was partially set, Georgetown University, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=92.2s)]
*  which I eventually did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Ghost, with that famous scene of her making pottery with Patrick Swayze, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=97.92s)]
*  made me want to live in a New York loft. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=102.0s)]
*  That, alas, never happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=104.0s)]
*  Her later films, like A Few Good Men, G.I. Jane, and Decent Proposal, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=106.72s)]
*  were basically the metronome of my younger life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=110.96s)]
*  Along the way, I grew to admire her chutzpah [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=114.3s)]
*  as she became the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=116.8s)]
*  as well as an early advocate of pay equity more broadly, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=119.72s)]
*  long before the issue was part of the national discourse. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  And after a stint away from Hollywood, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  in 2019, she penned a smart and revealing memoir [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=130.14s)]
*  about her tumultuous childhood, her iconic roles, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  and her high-profile marriages to both Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=137.54s)]
*  Moore is now in her 60s, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=142.46s)]
*  and she tells me she's finally grown comfortable in her own skin [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=145.0s)]
*  and is abending expectations about what it means to be an aging woman [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  in the industry that both embraced and judged her her whole career. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Demi Moore. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=160.64s)]
*  I see we have a special guest. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=168.44s)]
*  Yes, we do. Pilaf the little mouse. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=170.52s)]
*  Pilaf the little mouse. And just because people won't be able to see you, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=173.06s)]
*  you have Pilaf in a sling? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=176.52s)]
*  Yes. Generally, she likes to be close up to the heart. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=178.6s)]
*  That's her job. She regulates the heart. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=181.56s)]
*  I'm a dog person, so I'm just like, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=184.52s)]
*  we're just gonna have her be here, and I'm very excited about that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=186.9s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about the new movie. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=190.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=193.4s)]
*  I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=194.7s)]
*  You play Elizabeth Sparkle, which is a fantastic name. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=198.12s)]
*  She's an aging actress, turned celebrity fitness instructor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=201.0s)]
*  Why did you sign on to star in a movie about a woman [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  who's aging in Hollywood and at war with her own body? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  Because obviously, it felt very meta watching you do this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say, on one hand, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  why it was easy for me to step in and do this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  is because I don't feel I am her. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=222.38s)]
*  You know, this is a woman who has no family. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  She's dedicated her entire life to her career, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  and when that's taken, what does she have? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And so, I feel like, in a way, I had enough separation from her, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=233.62s)]
*  and at the same time, a deep, internal connection [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  to the pain that she was experiencing, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=244.12s)]
*  the rejection that she felt, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  and I mean, I knew it would be challenging, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  but potentially really important, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=254.7s)]
*  important exploration on the issue. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=257.48s)]
*  Tell me what you sort of understand the issue to be, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=259.94s)]
*  because there's so much in this film. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=263.94s)]
*  Well, I think when I really look at it, for me, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=267.48s)]
*  what was the most powerful [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=270.86s)]
*  is that it's not about what's being done to us, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=274.9s)]
*  it's what we do to ourselves. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=278.24s)]
*  It's the violence that we have against ourselves, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=280.74s)]
*  the lack of love and self-acceptance, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=283.6s)]
*  and that, you know, within the story, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  we have this male perspective of the idealized woman [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=290.48s)]
*  that I feel like we as women have bought into. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=296.32s)]
*  I mean, the movie starts with your character [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=300.12s)]
*  sitting down with a male executive [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=304.0s)]
*  and being told, when you turn 50, it's over. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=305.68s)]
*  Is that something that you heard a lot working in Hollywood? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=309.22s)]
*  I feel like it's less overt. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  It's less overt and a little bit more [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  of the unspoken perception that your desirability, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  and I think there's a line in the film that, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=324.82s)]
*  says that your desirability as a woman [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=328.7s)]
*  is done with your fertility. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=332.0s)]
*  Which for me, it's again, it's a perception [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=335.42s)]
*  that's been bought into, but it doesn't make it the truth. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=339.04s)]
*  You know, I was watching you, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=343.12s)]
*  and there's a real vulnerability to your role, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  which is you're naked in a lot of the film. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=350.5s)]
*  And I was thinking about what it meant for you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=352.84s)]
*  to be so exposed now in your 60s as opposed to your 20s, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=357.34s)]
*  because you have this duality here, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=361.18s)]
*  You're playing with Margaret Qualley, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  who is, you know, supposed to be the younger version of you, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=365.34s)]
*  and I was wondering, are you more comfortable, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=369.76s)]
*  less comfortable? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=372.68s)]
*  I mean, you know, going into this, I knew, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=373.8s)]
*  like, this is not about me looking great. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=377.34s)]
*  And in fact, you know, it was, on one hand, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=379.8s)]
*  to be honest, there was a certain liberation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=384.14s)]
*  in the role that wasn't having to be perfect. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=386.64s)]
*  And it's not that there aren't shots in it, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=390.52s)]
*  like, where I go, oh, my ass looks awful. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=393.18s)]
*  But I'm also okay with it. I'm in acceptance of it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=397.06s)]
*  And I think part of what was interesting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  is that Elizabeth is being rejected, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=404.18s)]
*  and it's not that I look that bad. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  You look unbelievably fantastic. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  But it's not like... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=415.22s)]
*  But you can see that you're not 20. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=416.6s)]
*  Exactly. But I mean, I, look, I, it's, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=419.22s)]
*  it's, I certainly went through very thoughtful consideration [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=422.56s)]
*  about all of it, going in, you know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=427.26s)]
*  knowing not only that, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=430.72s)]
*  knowing that there were going to be shots, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=432.68s)]
*  and angles, and things done to actually accentuate [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=436.18s)]
*  not looking good. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=439.56s)]
*  But I think that there was great beauty in that, you know. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=441.94s)]
*  I've struggled with letting my vulnerability [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=446.18s)]
*  be seen in my personal life. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=449.56s)]
*  Even though I know that our greatest power [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  is our vulnerability. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=458.26s)]
*  And yet I fight against it all the time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=460.22s)]
*  You know, I watched you in that scene [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=465.68s)]
*  where you're standing fully naked [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=468.98s)]
*  and you have a close-up of your backside and all of it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=470.76s)]
*  And I thought, that's incredibly brave. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  And then I thought, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=479.34s)]
*  I'm not happy that I feel that that is brave. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=481.34s)]
*  That's an interesting thought. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=485.46s)]
*  I think that the idea that it related to being brave [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  is because we all know that we age. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=493.38s)]
*  And so it's not as plump and robust and tight, you know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=497.46s)]
*  It's not, it's those things that are parts of the body [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  that we don't necessarily always want everybody to see [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=507.8s)]
*  when it's not what it used to be. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=511.42s)]
*  And they make it a really big feature of the film. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=514.62s)]
*  I mean, you get all the close-ups of Margaret's body [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=517.38s)]
*  and I don't know how old she is. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=520.12s)]
*  Twenty-something. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=522.38s)]
*  Twenty-something, yeah. And she looks it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=523.66s)]
*  And so you're seeing it in comparison. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=526.0s)]
*  What were you thinking when you saw that comparison? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=528.42s)]
*  What's interesting is, you know, like, I mean, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=532.0s)]
*  it goes back again to that male perspective [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  of the idealized woman. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=540.88s)]
*  The one that's being rejected because it's, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  the ass isn't as plump and as high and as tight. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=545.72s)]
*  And, you know, this other that's being celebrated. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=549.4200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I guess, you know, in looking at it, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=552.88s)]
*  outside of the first knee-jerk of like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=557.12s)]
*  oh, like, I didn't love my butt. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=558.96s)]
*  It was really more for me, the important, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  like, I felt more proud of the power between showing the two, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  the vulnerable part, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  and the part that has yet to experience. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  Like, she's, like, newly born. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=578.84s)]
*  She doesn't know yet what life is. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=582.14s)]
*  So the question is, would you trade your wisdom [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=585.46s)]
*  for a tight ass? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=590.08s)]
*  And where do you land on that question? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=592.88s)]
*  I would like to not have to choose. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think part of, for me, the liberation of doing this film [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=597.12s)]
*  was in a way of realizing that I'm here to define [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=604.96s)]
*  who I am at almost 62. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=610.22s)]
*  And I don't need to play by any rules [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  that have existed up until now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know what that is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=619.08s)]
*  because I haven't been here before. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=620.38s)]
*  You know, it's like the idea I remember long, long, long ago, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=622.88s)]
*  somewhere, like, you know, hearing and passing [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=627.3399999999999s)]
*  that at a certain age you shouldn't have long hair. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=629.92s)]
*  And I think unconsciously there was a part of me [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=633.2199999999999s)]
*  that didn't buy into that, that said, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  well, who made that rule? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=639.3s)]
*  And so somehow after I had shaved my head for G.I. Jane, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=641.64s)]
*  I just started to let my hair grow. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=646.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's a part of me that's a bit rebellious [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=649.38s)]
*  or that's also just trying to challenge the question. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=652.04s)]
*  Just because that's how it's been, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=655.14s)]
*  that doesn't mean that's how it has to be. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you think all women should shave their heads at some point? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=659.92s)]
*  Well, I would say that there is a very powerful experience [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=663.0s)]
*  with shaving your head, and I probably never felt more naked [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=669.5799999999999s)]
*  than when my head was shaved. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=673.26s)]
*  It was quite life-changing, in fact, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=675.8s)]
*  because not only did I... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=678.04s)]
*  You know, I realized, like, we as women, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=680.12s)]
*  when we have our head, we kind of move through the world, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=682.2s)]
*  we go like this, whereas men move very direct [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=684.58s)]
*  and very forward without apology. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=687.74s)]
*  You're moving your hand, like, undulating. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=690.16s)]
*  Yeah, like, we move side to side, kind of, you know, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=691.88s)]
*  and when I didn't have that, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=694.28s)]
*  I sat in myself in a very different way. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=696.42s)]
*  I feel like I took and had a strength. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=699.04s)]
*  And you see the length of my hair, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=702.92s)]
*  it's not how I wanted to, you know, go forward [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=704.9s)]
*  with having a shaved head, but it was very empowering. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=709.14s)]
*  You sound like you've gotten to some degree of acceptance [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=716.0600000000001s)]
*  about where you are in your life, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=721.64s)]
*  and after struggling with self-image for such a long time, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=723.9s)]
*  after struggling with, you know, being in the public eye [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=727.32s)]
*  and being judged, and... [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=731.02s)]
*  I do want to ask you about, though, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  what you think about discussing this stuff openly. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=735.26s)]
*  Is it better to talk about it and normalize it, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=740.1s)]
*  or is it better to keep it private [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=743.9s)]
*  and say, it's none of your business what I do? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=747.22s)]
*  I don't know. This is kind of a tough question. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=751.22s)]
*  I've lived a life that's both been extremely private [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=755.1s)]
*  and public, and it's been... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=760.98s)]
*  I've had a huge learning curve with that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=767.06s)]
*  You know, I had talk about feeling unsafe, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=770.66s)]
*  like to the point where I felt like my life [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=773.9399999999999s)]
*  had become almost agoraphobic [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=776.48s)]
*  and I never wanted to leave my house. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=778.02s)]
*  And so there is, you know, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=780.78s)]
*  I don't know if there's any one right way, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=783.78s)]
*  but I think it really is about the individual. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=787.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, your book is an incredibly open memoir. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=791.48s)]
*  I mean, it is one of the best celebrity memoirs I've read. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, gosh, thank you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's also very revealing, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=801.66s)]
*  in a way that is at times shocking [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=804.56s)]
*  in someone as well known as you are. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=808.86s)]
*  And clearly deeply emotional. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=812.52s)]
*  It came out five years ago. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=815.66s)]
*  I'm wondering what it feels like [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=818.48s)]
*  now that it's been out in the world for a while [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=822.56s)]
*  to have revealed so much of yourself. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=824.98s)]
*  I was very thoughtful about what I shared, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  because there's a lot more life that's lived than is in the book. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=831.64s)]
*  And I think for me, the personal catharsis [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=835.68s)]
*  was in really exploring the essential question that I had, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=840.06s)]
*  which is how did I get here? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=845.14s)]
*  Like, how did I get here? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=847.6s)]
*  Like, coming from where I came from, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=849.34s)]
*  on paper, like the life that I've lived, like it was... [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=852.14s)]
*  Growing up poor with an extremely dysfunctional [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=856.84s)]
*  and stable household. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=859.26s)]
*  Yeah, no education, no guidance, no safety net, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=860.6s)]
*  like on my own at 16. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=864.8s)]
*  And to really like the places I've been, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=867.56s)]
*  the people I've met, the opportunities [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=870.18s)]
*  of things I've experienced. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=872.34s)]
*  And it was like, how did I get here? Wow. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=874.22s)]
*  And then the other part, obviously, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=876.84s)]
*  is I start the book with my life really like having exploded. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=878.22s)]
*  And so then the question was like, how the fuck did I get here? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=882.0s)]
*  And so looking at the parallel of those two things [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=885.96s)]
*  allowed me also to be able to really see [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=890.42s)]
*  the gifts within all of the challenges that occurred. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=894.38s)]
*  And in fact, it gave me a deep compassion for my mother. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=897.8s)]
*  Because I thought if I can't find compassion for my mother, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=902.76s)]
*  an innocent being who came into the world just as we all do, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=906.18s)]
*  how can I expect my children to have compassion for me? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=910.64s)]
*  For my failings? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=913.88s)]
*  That very difficult relationship with your mother, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=916.1s)]
*  who was an alcoholic and... [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=918.46s)]
*  Bipolar, yes. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=921.46s)]
*  And this very difficult upbringing that you had, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=923.18s)]
*  it did send you on this journey of trying to control your body [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=925.46s)]
*  in different ways. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=928.54s)]
*  Through disordered eating, through excessive exercise, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=930.54s)]
*  through drugs and alcohol, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=933.88s)]
*  you became sober, we should say, in your 20s. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=935.9599999999999s)]
*  When you were starting out in the industry, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=941.26s)]
*  it must have been pretty common to have those issues. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you remember talking to other young actresses about that stuff? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=947.8s)]
*  Or was it kept kind of private? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=951.54s)]
*  I don't know if I ever had... I mean, I can't think of anything specific. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=954.3s)]
*  I mean, I think there was a general kind of sense about... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=958.76s)]
*  you know, certain expectations, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=961.64s)]
*  but I mean, I look in particular coming out of the 80s and the 90s, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=964.8s)]
*  where there was, I think, a greater pressure for perfection [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=969.88s)]
*  that kind of existed. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=976.64s)]
*  If you look at any advertising, everything was very clean and perfect, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=978.22s)]
*  and there wasn't any body inclusivity. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=982.3s)]
*  There wasn't, you know... [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=986.38s)]
*  There was a more extreme standard of beauty that existed, you know, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=988.72s)]
*  and I did, as I wrote in the book, personally experience [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=993.8s)]
*  being told to lose weight on quite a few films [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=996.72s)]
*  before I ever even had my children. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1000.88s)]
*  And again, those were humiliating experiences, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1004.3s)]
*  but the true violence was what I was doing to myself. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1008.72s)]
*  The way in which I tortured myself, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1012.8s)]
*  did extreme crazy exercise, weighed and measured my food, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1015.8s)]
*  because I was putting all of my value of who I was [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1019.88s)]
*  into how my body was, how it looked, what... [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1024.96s)]
*  And again, giving other people's opinion more power than myself. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1030.8s)]
*  When did you realize that that was having such an enormous effect on you, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  that they were not going to be able to see you as a person? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1041.96s)]
*  That they were going to have to rely on you? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1045.2s)]
*  That the outside gaze, not only just of men, but of everybody, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1047.28s)]
*  was really damaging your own sense of who you were? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1050.3600000000001s)]
*  I think after I finished GI Jane is when I had a huge shift, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1057.32s)]
*  because I think I had manipulated my body, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1064.32s)]
*  I had changed it over multiple times through just pure force and discipline, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1067.4s)]
*  and when I finished that film, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1072.4s)]
*  I think I was so kind of worn down in this battle that I had been in, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1075.48s)]
*  that I finally surrendered. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1084.72s)]
*  And I feel like I just started to ask to be my natural size, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  because I didn't know what it was. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1093.88s)]
*  I literally couldn't go in a gym, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1095.96s)]
*  I couldn't control food in that way, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1098.0400000000002s)]
*  and I really experienced the gift of surrender. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  Not giving up, but surrendering this idea that I was actually in control. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1107.2s)]
*  And I moved into probably what I would say was almost like a spiritual awakening [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1112.2800000000002s)]
*  of really knowing what it is when you accept yourself exactly in that moment, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1119.3600000000001s)]
*  even if you don't like it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1124.44s)]
*  Was part of that to do with the fact that you had transformed yourself [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1126.52s)]
*  so much for that role, and it had been not well received, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1131.72s)]
*  and you were getting a lot of criticism. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1135.8s)]
*  It was coming off of the back of striptease as well, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  that it just turned off that spigot, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1140.96s)]
*  that you just were like, I'm not going to listen to this anymore? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1145.04s)]
*  I mean, even before any of that happened, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1149.12s)]
*  I think that I truly was physically worn down. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1151.2s)]
*  I mean, I finished that film with a shaved head, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1156.28s)]
*  and I was 138 pounds, and for me, that's a lot. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1161.56s)]
*  And I felt like I didn't, like I felt like this, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1165.6399999999999s)]
*  it's not that I was a different person, but I didn't know who, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1170.72s)]
*  like it was this thing where, and I think on a personal level, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1173.8s)]
*  I finished that, and then not too long after I finished, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1180.52s)]
*  my mother was dying, my relationship was starting to kind of disintegrate, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1185.6s)]
*  and so I think it was all just mounting. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1190.76s)]
*  It was like I needed all of that happening at once [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1194.84s)]
*  actually to get me to the point of surrendering and letting go. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, you were someone who, and especially at this point, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1203.0s)]
*  you were one of the most famous women in the world, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1206.6799999999998s)]
*  a lot of interest in your personal life, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1209.76s)]
*  and just this sense that you were being too well paid, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1211.84s)]
*  you were too powerful, you were too much. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1217.84s)]
*  Well, I think I can look back, and on one hand, with Striptease, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  it was as if I had betrayed women, and with G.I. Jane, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1227.0s)]
*  it was as if I had betrayed men. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1232.08s)]
*  But I think the interesting piece in that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  is that when I became the highest paid actress, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1237.24s)]
*  there was something, if you really look at collectively [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1241.32s)]
*  why is it that at that moment, the choice was to bring me down? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  And again, I don't take this personal. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1252.48s)]
*  I think whoever it had been, this may have happened to. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1254.56s)]
*  But because I did a film that was dealing with the world of stripping [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  and the body, I was extremely shamed. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1267.6s)]
*  And I think anyone who had been in the position that was the first [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1272.56s)]
*  to get that kind of equality of pay would probably have taken a hit. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1277.6399999999999s)]
*  At that moment, your husband Bruce was getting paid [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  a huge amount of money for doing films. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1289.7199999999998s)]
*  Did you compare yourself to him? Did you talk about it with him? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1291.8s)]
*  Did he understand that you asking for equal pay was fair? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, because you were married to a fellow actor, so... [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1297.9599999999998s)]
*  I never really spoke about it because again, for me, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  it wasn't... I wasn't in competition with anybody else. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1304.2s)]
*  It was about my own competition with myself [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1308.28s)]
*  to see what's the best that I can do. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  You didn't understand that it had significance for all female actors? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1313.44s)]
*  Oh, 100%. I knew that a new baseline being set, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1317.52s)]
*  that for me was the greatest gift of all of it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  But inside myself, it wasn't about comparing myself to him. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1325.68s)]
*  I had like, yes, I saw what they got paid. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1330.4s)]
*  It was really more about just like, why shouldn't I? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1333.48s)]
*  If I'm doing the same amount of work, why shouldn't I? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1339.5600000000002s)]
*  And, you know, it's no different than when I did [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1342.64s)]
*  the cover for Vanity Fair pregnant. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1347.72s)]
*  Like, I didn't understand why it was such a big deal to, you know, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1349.8s)]
*  why women when they were pregnant needed to be hidden. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1356.56s)]
*  Like, why is it that we have to deny that we had sex? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  That's the fear, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1362.72s)]
*  If you show your belly, that means, oh my gosh, you've had sex. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1364.8s)]
*  This is, of course, the Vanity Fair cover shot by Annie Levovitz [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1367.8799999999999s)]
*  that broke the internet before there was the internet. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1371.96s)]
*  Of you naked and pregnant. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1376.44s)]
*  And this is the thing, there are these moments throughout your life [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1378.52s)]
*  and your career where your physical self has been at such the forefront [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1382.52s)]
*  of culture and has been really pushing the boundaries all along. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1387.6s)]
*  And you yourself were feeling terrible about yourself. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1391.68s)]
*  I think that's one of the misconceptions is that when I did things like this idea [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1395.76s)]
*  that, oh, I love my body so much, versus what the truth was is that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1401.84s)]
*  these things were coming along. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1406.92s)]
*  Obviously, I was choosing them, but I think that it was all in service [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1409.3200000000002s)]
*  to helping me try to overcome my issues, my self-loathing, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1413.4s)]
*  my feeling of not being enough. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1417.48s)]
*  And to help build my confidence, actually not because I was confident. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  It's kind of like a fake it till you make it approach. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1428.64s)]
*  Oh, that is my primary university. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1431.72s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1439.76s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of this moment now [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  where everything is being reassessed. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1444.92s)]
*  We look back at how women were treated in the 90s and the 80s. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1448.0s)]
*  And I'm wondering what your thoughts have been on watching the culture shift. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm excited to see the shift. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1459.16s)]
*  I mean, it's like, what can I say? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1463.24s)]
*  I think it's a natural progression of women stepping in and taking their place. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1465.36s)]
*  That's it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1473.44s)]
*  I look at my daughters and there are things they would never question [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1475.52s)]
*  about what they can and can't do [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1480.6s)]
*  in ways that were perhaps limitations that existed in my time at their same ages. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1485.68s)]
*  Sorry, mouse. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1495.4s)]
*  I was talking really big with my hands and I interrupted Pilaf's sleep. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1497.48s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1502.56s)]
*  Does that make sense, by the way, what I was just saying? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1504.64s)]
*  It does. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1507.72s)]
*  I also am wondering with the cultural shift, isn't it just like you're pissed off? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1509.8s)]
*  You had to go through all that and now the culture's finally caught up with you? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1516.88s)]
*  No, because why would I waste my energy being pissed off? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1521.88s)]
*  I remember sitting down with my team and saying, I had done GI Jane, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1525.96s)]
*  I really wanted an action kind of film. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1532.0400000000002s)]
*  I felt like that was something that I would really love to explore [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  and kind of being looked at with these polite faces, but you're crazy. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1543.2s)]
*  I can look and see, well, since that time, actresses of that next generation down, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  where that started to open up. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1556.44s)]
*  I don't need to be pissed off. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1558.52s)]
*  I can feel disappointed that that didn't happen for me, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1560.6000000000001s)]
*  but I feel equally in celebration that thank God it is. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1564.68s)]
*  Thank God it is. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1569.76s)]
*  I don't want to end without asking you how Bruce Willis is doing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1572.76s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot of interest and concern. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1578.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1580.92s)]
*  I think given the Givens, where he's at is in a beautiful, stable place. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1583.0s)]
*  You really just have to take it one day at a time. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1591.08s)]
*  I'm so grateful that our collective families are so close [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1594.16s)]
*  and that we spend time together, that we are in such support. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1601.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not something I would wish on anyone, but as I've said before, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1609.68s)]
*  one of the most important things is that you really meet them where they're at [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1615.76s)]
*  and you let go of any attachment to what they were or what you would want. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1620.8400000000001s)]
*  You really take the joy of all of the moments you have with where they are, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1627.8799999999999s)]
*  which is so sweet and loving. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1632.9599999999998s)]
*  After the break, I called Demi back [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1639.8s)]
*  and asked her about getting sober for the first time when she was 21 [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1641.9599999999998s)]
*  and what it's been like for her to experience the world as a sober person now. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1646.04s)]
*  I can go into a room, a gathering, and if I'm uncomfortable, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1650.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't need to try to take the edge off it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1656.0800000000002s)]
*  I can actually just go, oh, wow, isn't that interesting? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1658.72s)]
*  I'm a little uncomfortable right now. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1661.3200000000002s)]
*  Hi, Lulu. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1677.5600000000002s)]
*  Hi. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  How are you? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1679.72s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1680.96s)]
*  I came away from our first conversation thinking about how, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1686.92s)]
*  in all these different ways, you were ahead of the culture. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1692.0s)]
*  You were an early champion of pay equity, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1696.3600000000001s)]
*  you were an early champion of sex positivity, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1698.68s)]
*  and the other thing we didn't really talk about is sobriety. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1701.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm someone who has been a year and a half sober myself. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1706.2s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1710.0800000000002s)]
*  I was wondering if you'd talk about your sobriety journey, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1711.16s)]
*  if you feel comfortable with that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1714.28s)]
*  Yeah, within certain reason. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1715.88s)]
*  I feel like I'm so grateful to be sober. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1719.16s)]
*  The majority of my adult life, I've been sober. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1724.16s)]
*  And it's so much more natural to me. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1728.04s)]
*  And I really fit a profile of it being genetic. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1731.24s)]
*  It's in my family. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1737.8400000000001s)]
*  And as challenging as the moments that were low, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1740.8s)]
*  I have to say I wouldn't exchange that [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1746.68s)]
*  for the quality of the life I have, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1750.8s)]
*  most importantly, because it's given me emotional sobriety. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1753.9199999999998s)]
*  Explain what you mean by that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1758.72s)]
*  I think everyone understands the idea of being sober from drugs, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1760.9199999999998s)]
*  alcohol, sex, shopping, those kind of externalised things. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1766.88s)]
*  But what it is to be emotionally sober [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1773.52s)]
*  means how I'm choosing to live my life, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1776.8400000000001s)]
*  the quality of how I interact with people, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1779.92s)]
*  my ability to show up and suit up for others. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1783.5600000000002s)]
*  That's all within my emotional sobriety. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1787.3200000000002s)]
*  Because all the things that are used to medicate, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1790.52s)]
*  and it's not just drugs and alcohol, there's many things. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1794.16s)]
*  Food. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1796.4s)]
*  Food. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1797.48s)]
*  I mean, you know. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1798.5600000000002s)]
*  And when you no longer have that knee jerked to numb yourself out, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1800.64s)]
*  yes, life can be a little edgy, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1807.76s)]
*  but now I know I can go into a room, a gathering, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1810.96s)]
*  and if I'm uncomfortable, I don't need to try to take the edge off it. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1816.5600000000002s)]
*  I can actually just go, oh, wow, isn't that interesting? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1820.92s)]
*  I'm a little uncomfortable right now. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1823.52s)]
*  Not reacting to the things. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1825.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think what I know now is when you're numbing yourself out, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1826.92s)]
*  your discernment for things isn't the same. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  So I know if I'm at a party, let's say, I know when to leave, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1836.16s)]
*  because I'm not going to be on the same level anymore with other people, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1842.72s)]
*  and I'm OK with that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1847.64s)]
*  Like, I recognise I have two speeds, go and go faster. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1849.8s)]
*  And so, you know, drugs and alcohol just aren't a right fit for me. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, reading about how you became sober, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1862.28s)]
*  which was during St. Elmo's fire, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1866.04s)]
*  and the director basically having an intervention [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1868.1999999999998s)]
*  and saying you have to go do this, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1871.8s)]
*  lots of people who've struggled with addiction have had those moments, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1875.84s)]
*  but you kind of stuck with it. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1879.8s)]
*  And I'm wondering, looking back now, why you think that was. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think at that time, I remember being sent to this place, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1886.24s)]
*  and they wanted to check me in for treatment, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  and me saying, well, I can't because I'm going to start a film. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1895.84s)]
*  And they said, what's more important to you, the film or your life? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1900.6s)]
*  And I said, the film. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1903.84s)]
*  Because that was my only sense of self and value. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1907.32s)]
*  And so, the incredible gift, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1911.68s)]
*  like I really feel like it was divine intervention, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  is that by them sticking their neck out for me [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1918.3200000000002s)]
*  to stay in the film under the circumstances, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1923.04s)]
*  gave me something more than me to want to... [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1927.76s)]
*  And in a certain way, it was my fear. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1932.8400000000001s)]
*  It was my fear of losing this thing that I was pursuing [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  that really meant everything at that moment. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1939.6s)]
*  I didn't have enough of myself to do it for me. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1942.72s)]
*  And I think it really kept me sober. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1946.56s)]
*  But I want to just clarify, just so that I'm being transparent, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1948.9199999999998s)]
*  I did step out. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1953.04s)]
*  I did a detour, and I had almost 20 years of sobriety. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1956.04s)]
*  I had a detour, and now I have over 12 years. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  And the detour, I think I was really young when I got sober. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1965.76s)]
*  I was not yet 22. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1970.88s)]
*  And I think, as much as there's one part that says, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1975.04s)]
*  boy, it would have been nice not to have to open that door, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1979.44s)]
*  but it solidified without any question for me [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1983.56s)]
*  which path I wanted to take. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1988.8s)]
*  Was it hard to get sober again? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1991.72s)]
*  I think when you have that much time and you open the door, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1994.12s)]
*  it's difficult because there's a part of you [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=1999.0s)]
*  that feels like you knew better. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2002.68s)]
*  And so you want to prove that you can manage it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2005.36s)]
*  And managing it is just not in my makeup. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2011.12s)]
*  It's not in my chemical response to alcohol. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2014.96s)]
*  But I sure gave it a hell of a shot. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2019.56s)]
*  OK, a few more questions, and then I will let you go. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2024.8s)]
*  There have been reports of a St. Elmo's Fire reboot. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2029.16s)]
*  True or not? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2033.28s)]
*  There are some discussions, yes. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2035.04s)]
*  It's kind of early, early stages, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2038.52s)]
*  but from my understanding, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2041.04s)]
*  I think pretty much everyone from the original cast [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2044.28s)]
*  is in, or at least open, and interested. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2047.8s)]
*  Which I think would be really fun. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2052.96s)]
*  There was something... [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2058.84s)]
*  It was such an important time for us as young actors. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2061.0s)]
*  And when Andrew McCarthy just did the documentary, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2065.8s)]
*  I was just in New York and went to the screening and sat on a panel. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2070.76s)]
*  Ali Shidi was there. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2076.96s)]
*  And I realized I hadn't seen her probably in, I don't know, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2078.76s)]
*  almost 30 years. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2082.36s)]
*  And that was crazy. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2084.6400000000003s)]
*  But yet, I can't... [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2086.6800000000003s)]
*  The feeling I had when I saw her, I was... [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2088.76s)]
*  It just... I felt my heart expand in that way. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2092.4s)]
*  Because I think we were all just so young, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2096.6800000000003s)]
*  and it was kind of exciting, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2099.88s)]
*  and this shift that was occurring in our industry [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2101.6800000000003s)]
*  of films being made about things that were happening in our lives. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2108.12s)]
*  It just was just... I don't know. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2114.72s)]
*  So I think it would be really... It would be fun. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2118.24s)]
*  You know, something that stuck with me [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2123.52s)]
*  is that you said in our first conversation [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2125.88s)]
*  that there was a period in your life when you became almost agoraphobic [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  and didn't want to leave your house [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2131.0s)]
*  because of the burdens of fame. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2134.36s)]
*  You know, at this point, you've been famous for decades. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2136.72s)]
*  And I'm wondering what your relationship to fame is now. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2140.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. I'll give you an example. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2144.0s)]
*  I think that the time that I was talking about [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2146.08s)]
*  was feeling like how I was experiencing and holding, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2148.72s)]
*  like with being out on the street and paparazzi popping up. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2156.6s)]
*  And I felt that I was in a battle with them. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2161.52s)]
*  And my privacy was being invaded, and I felt unsafe. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2167.4s)]
*  And what I realized is, you know, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2175.48s)]
*  our bodies don't know the difference between a gun and a camera. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2177.92s)]
*  All we know is we're being gone after. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2182.72s)]
*  And so I didn't know... [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2187.68s)]
*  I hadn't really processed how to regulate [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2189.36s)]
*  that feeling of somebody trying to take from me. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2193.04s)]
*  Somebody was, like, in a sense, attacking me. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2195.32s)]
*  And I feel like now my relationship with it [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2199.32s)]
*  is I experience it with ease and grace. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2203.64s)]
*  Like yesterday, my daughter Scout and I [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2207.6s)]
*  were going to a friend's surprise birthday. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2210.2s)]
*  And we were walking from the car where we parked, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2214.2s)]
*  and out of nowhere two guys popped up. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2218.68s)]
*  And the difference is now I don't hold it [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2221.92s)]
*  as that they're taking anything from me, that I am under siege. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2225.3199999999997s)]
*  And that doesn't mean I always like it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2229.64s)]
*  Like, did I like that they popped out of nowhere? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2231.24s)]
*  But, you know, I just don't. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2233.72s)]
*  And so, I don't know. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the only part I can think of of fame. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2238.6s)]
*  Because I guess in general I don't think about it very much. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2243.12s)]
*  Actually. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. I've really, really enjoyed this. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2249.84s)]
*  Thank you for being so open. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2253.08s)]
*  My pleasure. And really, well done. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2254.68s)]
*  Bravo for the year. That's amazing. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv61ztMYgNw&t=2257.88s)]
